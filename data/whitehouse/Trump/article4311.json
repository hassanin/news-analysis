Wilkie\t\t\t\t\tSecretary of the Department of Veterans AffairsThe facts are clear: No president has done more in two years to strengthen our military and reform the Department of Veterans Affairs to better serve our nation’s heroes than President Donald Trump.From pushing the Islamic State terrorist organization to the brink of defeat, to increasing troop strength and modernizing our military’s equipment on the battlefield, Trump sends a strong signal to any country or terrorist group that confronting the United States or our allies is a losing proposition.Until Trump, no candidate in history had made serving our veterans the centerpiece of a presidential campaign. In office, Trump has kept his promise, improving the lives of America’s veterans through a number of key initiatives that enact more reform across the organization than at any other time in decades.These impactful reforms include the MISSION Act, which provides real health care choice to eligible veterans, and the Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which makes VA one of the most accountable agencies in the federal government.Read the full op-ed.Robert L. Wilkie is the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. This op-ed appeared in USA Today on November 16, 2018. ",
