The allegations in this article are categorically false and represent just the latest attempt by the media to divide this Administration.Thanks to the President’s leadership, we are rebuilding the military, ISIS is on the run, and we’ve seen more than 1 million jobs created while the stock market hits all-time highs.The American people know that I could not be more honored to be working side by side with a president who is making America great again.Whatever fake news may come our way, my entire team will continue to focus all our efforts to advance the President’s agenda and see him re-elected in 2020. Any suggestion otherwise is both laughable and absurd.",
