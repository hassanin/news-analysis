We have no choice. For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get the prices way down, so that’s what we’re going to be talking about. We’re also going to be streamlining the process so that from your standpoint when you have drug you can actually get it approved, if it works instead of waiting for many, many years. The U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country but the pricing has been astronomical for our country.”President Trump Focused On Cutting Regulations To Encourage Drug Companies To Bring Back Operations And Jobs To The United StatesPRESIDENT TRUMP: “So you have to get your companies back here.
