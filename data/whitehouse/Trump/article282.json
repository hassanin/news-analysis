I commend the new government and the people of Burundi for the recent historic peaceful transfer of power and encourage the new government to continue to engage with the United States and other countries to address the underlying actions and policies of the Government of Burundi that led to the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 13712. At this time, however, I have not seen sufficient evidence that the situation is resolved.As such, the situation in Burundi continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on November 22, 2015, to deal with that threat must continue in effect beyond November 22, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Burundi declared in Executive Order 13712.This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.DONALD J. TRUMPTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nNovember 12, 2020.",
