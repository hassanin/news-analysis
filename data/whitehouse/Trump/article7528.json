Before the First Lady arrived, the National Park Service (NPS), which maintains the White House grounds, provided a tutorial on how to harvest and plant.The First Lady spoke briefly to the children gathered in the garden, encouraging them to keep a healthy diet and eat fresh foods, then invited them to join her in picking and washing vegetables.“Healthy, nurturing, and positive environments are instrumental in enhancing the well-being and mindfulness of all children,” Mrs. Trump said. “They learn so much through their surroundings and the White House Kitchen Garden is a prime example of how children can enjoy the outdoors and learn about healthy eating and living, while also gaining an understanding of the White House and its rich history. I was so happy to be able to celebrate healthy living through fun activities with these special children today, and I look forward to future events in the garden.”",
