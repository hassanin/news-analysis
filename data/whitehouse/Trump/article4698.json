The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple. I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name—and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building—against these last-minute allegations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJudge Brett Kavanaugh\t\t\t\t\tThe accuser, Deborah Ramirez, admits in The New Yorker’s piece that there were “significant gaps” in her memories about the event. By The New Yorker’s own admission, Ramirez was reluctant to speak with certainty on the allegation. It took six days of “assessing her memories” for Ramirez to say she recalled Kavanaugh committing the alleged incident, and that came only after consulting with an attorney provided by the Democrats. The New Yorker admits it has not confirmed through eyewitnesses Kavanaugh was even present at the party and other students who knew Kavanaugh said they never heard of the incident. Further, those classmates said that the allegations in the story would be completely out of character for Kavanaugh.  A former student who was best friends with Ramirez said she never told her about the incident despite how close they were. ",
