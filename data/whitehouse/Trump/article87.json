Trump signed a memorandum to ensure that Federal officials assess actions of Antifa activists in light of Federal laws that restrict the entry of aliens associated with terrorist organizations and aliens intent on criminal activity.  President Trump will not allow Antifa, or any terrorist organization, to destroy our great country.",
