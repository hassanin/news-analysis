Schumer\nUnited States Senator\nWashington, D.C.  20515Dear Senator Schumer:Thank you for your Democrat public relations letter and incorrect sound bites, which are wrong in every way.If you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax, which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere (except increasing my poll numbers), and instead focused on helping the people of New York, then New York would not have been so completely unprepared for the “invisible enemy.” No wonder AOC and others are thinking about running against you in the primary. If they did, they would likely win.Fortunately, we have been working with your state and city governments, Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill DeBlasio, to get the job done.  You have been missing in action, except when it comes to the “press.”  While you have stated that you don’t like Andrew Cuomo, you ought to start working alongside him for the good of all New Yorkers.I’ve known you for many years, but I never knew how bad a Senator you are for the state of New York, until I became President.If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.  Or, in the alternative, call Rear Admiral Polowczyk.Sincerely yours,Donald J. Trump  ",
