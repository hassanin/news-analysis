Today’s ruling will further overwhelm our immigration courts with meritless cases, making the existing massive backlog even worse.  It will also encourage more illegal immigration to the United States, to the benefit of ruthless smuggling organizations that too often victimize young women and children.  Today’s ruling is only the latest example of judicial activism that encourages migrants to take dangerous risks; empowers criminal organizations that spread turmoil in our hemisphere; and undermines the laws, borders, Constitution, and sovereignty of the United States.  We will continue to fight for the rule of law and against these reckless rulings.",
