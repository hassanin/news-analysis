Trump signed into law the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017.  The Act renews the authority of the United States under section 702 of FISA to collect foreign intelligence on foreign targets overseas.  It also permits our Nation’s defenders to share information that prevents terrorist attacks and cyber crimes.  Our Nation wisely removed barriers to connecting intelligence dots after 9/11, and this reauthorization permits those important linkages to remain intact, while strengthening protections for Americans against government abuse.This six-year reauthorization was achieved with bipartisan support, recognizing the importance of FISA section 702 in producing foreign intelligence that protects our country from foreign terrorists and other foreign threats.  The Act enhances existing protections for Americans’ privacy and adds oversight against abuse.Intelligence produced under this authority is vital to keeping the Nation safe. As shown by the recent attacks in New York City and elsewhere around the globe, we face a constant threat from foreign terrorist networks and other foreign actors who would do us harm.We acknowledge Congress for their support in reauthorizing these authorities and contribution to the safety of our Nation.",
