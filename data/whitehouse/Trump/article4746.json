Since day one of his Administration, President Trump has made addressing the opioid crisis one of his top priorities, and he has directed his entire Administration to do the same. This legislation is an essential part of the response. Opioid misuse and addiction can affect anyone, which is why this epidemic truly is the crisis next door. Americans need to know their government is taking action to combat this crisis and supporting those on the frontlines who are dealing with opioid overdoses every day.",
