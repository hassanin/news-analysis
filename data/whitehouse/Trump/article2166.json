    "content": "\n\t\t\t\tStatements & Releases\t\t\t\nIssued on:\nDecember 9, 2019\nInspector General Michael Horowitz uncovered “significant inaccuracies and omissions” in FISA applications that precipitated one of the greatest abuses of investigative power in our lifetime. Since the day President Trump announced his candidacy, career bureaucrats at the Department of Justice sought to undermine this President and our Administration – including falsifying information and suppressing the truth. What took place here should never happen again to any President or any Administration in the future and those responsible should be held accountable.",
