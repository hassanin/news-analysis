These reports are reviewed by the White House and are used to identify and prevent potential financial conflicts of interest. The reports of the highest-level officials are also independently reviewed by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. Under section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act, these reports are available to the public upon request.To ensure timely response and maximum public disclosure, the White House may release some reports prior to their certification by the White House or the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. Uncertified reports are still considered to be under review, and are subject to change based on the robust review process of the Office of White House Counsel.",
