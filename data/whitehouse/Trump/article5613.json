Without this legislation, funding for the popular Veterans Choice Program would run out, making it harder for millions of veterans to receive the care they need.Mr. Trump has set a deadline of Memorial Day for Congress to pass this bill, which he promises to sign as soon as it reaches his desk. Our veterans should not wait any longer for world-class health care.…All Americans, especially veterans, should have a real choice in navigating their health journey. With a sense of urgency, I implore Congress to prioritize the health of our nation’s veterans and pass the VA Mission Act to better serve this deserving group of individuals. It would be the perfect way to celebrate Memorial Day weekend.Read the full op-ed here.",
