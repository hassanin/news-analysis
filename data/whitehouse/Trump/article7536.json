Trump met today with President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan in New York. President Trump and President Ghani expressed their commitment to fully implementing President Trump’s new South Asia strategy to defeat terrorism and ensure the safety and security of the American and Afghan people. They discussed economic development issues, including how American companies can help quickly develop Afghanistan’s rich rare earth mineral resources. They agreed that such initiatives would help American companies develop materials critical to national security while growing Afghanistan’s economy and creating new jobs in both countries, therefore defraying some of the costs of United States assistance as Afghans become more self-reliant.",
