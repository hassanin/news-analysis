The advent of the imperial era known as “Reiwa,” meaning “beautiful harmony,” comes at a time in which the bonds of friendship between the American and Japanese people have never been stronger. Our global partnership is an unshakeable pillar of peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and the world. It is a testament to the noble endeavor of advancing democracy, liberty, and human dignity for all. We wish the people of Japan our fondest regards and utmost respect on this auspicious and joyous occasion.",
