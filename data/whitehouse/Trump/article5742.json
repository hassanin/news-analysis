The new art therapy studio is now open at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health in Indianapolis. To be able to spend some time in the studio with some amazing Riley Kids was a privilege. They were hard at work creating.Thank you, Emily and Cassie, for all you do.This studio space will benefit patients, their siblings and their parents for years to come. Keep up the great work!
