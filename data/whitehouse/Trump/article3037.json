Participants included Huntington’s Fire Chief, leadership from Lily’s Place, a mother in recovery and her five-month-old child, a representative from a first responder wellness program, and a recovery coach.The First Lady has been an active proponent of promoting available resources meant to help families affected by the opioid epidemic.  Earlier this year, Mrs. Trump convened the Inter-Agency Working Group in part to learn more about the government programs available in state and local communities across the country. She has spoken at several events, including town halls to address the stigma of shame that often comes with addiction.  Using BE BEST, the First Lady will continue to encourage people to work together to change the public perception surrounding addiction so that victims will be more willing to seek out help.“Through BE BEST, I continue to learn about the many issues and challenges surrounding opioid addiction,” said First Lady Melania Trump.  “We have an opportunity to move the needle to help families and children who have been impacted by opioid abuse.  Meeting with federal, state, and local leaders in Huntington, West Virginia, today proved the power of partnerships and community efforts.  Through BE BEST, we can continue to promote programs and highlight resources available to all those who are seeking help with this national epidemic.”Prior to departing West Virginia, the First Lady made an off-the-record stop at Ritter Park.  Mrs. Trump visited a portion of the park to pay respect and view the hundreds of flags lining the field, which are symbolic of children who are currently in the foster care system as a direct result of the opioid epidemic.",
