Trump\t\t\t\t\tThis week, President Donald J. Trump joined Secretary Ryan Zinke at the Department of the Interior where he gave remarks and signed the Executive Order on the Review of Designations Under the Antiquities Act.The previous administration used a 100-year-old law known as the Antiquities Act to unilaterally put millions of acres of land and water under strict federal control, eliminating the ability of the people who actually live in those states to decide how best to use that land.The Antiquities Act does not give the federal government unlimited power to lock up millions of acres of land and water, and it is time we ended this abusive practice.This executive order will end this egregious abuse of federal power, and give that power back to the states and to the people, where it belongs.President Trump Gives Remarks and Signs the Antiquities Executive OrderIn his first 100 days, President Trump has taken historic action to eliminate wasteful regulations. He has worked to eliminate job-destroying regulations on farmers, ranchers, coal miners, auto workers, and so many other American workers and businesses.",
