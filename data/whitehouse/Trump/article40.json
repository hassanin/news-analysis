The report details the steadfast commitment to put America First, promote a strong middle class, and oversee two economic recoveries that have vastly exceeded expectations. The pillars of this movement—fair and reciprocal trade, tax reform, and extensive deregulation—have provided a framework for enduring American prosperity, and now exist as proof that the pro-growth policies of this Administration and the decisive response to the pandemic ameliorated the potential for severe and prolonged economic hardship.“Since taking office, rather than apologize for America, I have stood up for America. From day one of my Presidency, I have put America First, and I have fought for the American worker harder than anyone ever has.”\n–President Donald J. Trump",
