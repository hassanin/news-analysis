On behalf of the American people, I express my condolences to his family and the people of Vietnam.President Quang was a great friend of the United States. He graciously hosted me during my historic state visit to Hanoi in November 2017, and I am grateful for his personal commitment to deepening the United States-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership. We will not soon forget his contributions to peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region or his voice for Vietnam as a proud and independent nation on the world stage.",
