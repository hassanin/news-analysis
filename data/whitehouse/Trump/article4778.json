As I have made clear, the United States will not tolerate any form of foreign meddling in our elections.This Executive Order requires the intelligence community and other Federal agencies to assess the extent of any foreign interference after every United States election. If the United States determines that any foreign meddling has occurred, the Executive Order ensures a quick, forceful, and proportionate response.Specifically, the Executive Order authorizes appropriate and meaningful sanctions—some are full blocking sanctions, others are to be designed and calibrated in light of specific facts—against any individual, foreign entity, or country that authorizes, directs, sponsors, or otherwise supports foreign interference in a United States election. The Executive Order also directs the Executive Branch to develop a uniform process for assessing and determining foreign interference in United States elections.In the United States, primary responsibility for managing elections resides with State, territory, and local authorities. The Federal Government, however, plays an essential role in identifying and deterring foreign interference and supporting State and local officials to secure election infrastructure.When it comes to foreign policy, my Administration has delivered decisively and taken action where previous administrations have not. By signing this Executive Order, I am adding to my record of implementing the strongest measures to date of any United States President to protect our electoral system. As we enter election season this fall, the American people can rest assured that we are working diligently to ensure that our democracy remains secure from foreign threats.",
