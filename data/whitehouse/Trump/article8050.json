TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 17, 2017, as Made in America Day and this week, July 16 through July 22, as Made in America Week.  Today and this week, I call upon Americans to pay special tribute to the builders, to the ranchers, to the crafters, and to all those who work every day to make America great.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.DONALD J. TRUMP",
