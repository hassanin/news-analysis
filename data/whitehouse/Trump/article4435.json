Sections 101 and 201 purport to require the President to deny certain aliens entry into the United States, without a sufficient exception for the exercise of the President’s responsibility to receive ambassadors under Article II, section 3 of the Constitution. Section 104 purports to direct negotiations with foreign governments or to require the Executive to adopt a particular foreign policy. My Administration supports the diplomatic initiatives described in the Act but will treat these provisions in a manner consistent with the President’s exclusive constitutional authorities in the area of foreign relations.DONALD J. TRUMPTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nOctober 25, 2018.",
