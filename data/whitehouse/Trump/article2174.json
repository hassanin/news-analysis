Trump applauds the work of Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden to lower prescription drug costs and further improve their bipartisan legislation, such as adding a provision to limit monthly out-of-pocket spending for seniors with chronic high costs. No President has done more to lower the cost of prescription drugs than President Trump, and this Bill would be another huge step forward for American families – for their health, their peace of mind, and their financial security. The White House calls on Congress to act now to give Americans the relief they need by sending bipartisan drug pricing reform to the President’s desk this year.",
