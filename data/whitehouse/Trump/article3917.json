We express our deep condolences to the victims’ families, the Indian government, and the Indian people for the loss of life in this brutal attack.  The United States calls on Pakistan to end immediately the support and safe haven provided to all terrorist groups operating on its soil, whose only goal is to sow chaos, violence, and terror in the region. This attack only strengthens our resolve to bolster counterterrorism cooperation and coordination between the United States and India.",
