The President expressed his continued commitment to supporting our warfighters with increased and predictable funding to achieve peace through strength – an America First priority. The President noted he will continue to urge the Congress to pass a defense budget that enables the rebuilding of the U.S. Armed Forces by restoring readiness, growing the size of our force, and modernizing our capabilities. Finally, the President emphasized the role of the Congress in this potential shutdown and the need for Members of Congress to move quickly to approve a budget so our Nation remains fully protected.",
