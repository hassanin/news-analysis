This ruling also bars the horrific practices of organizations that are in the business of selling fetal remains, and should be welcomed by every American who cherishes the sanctity of life.We remain hopeful that at a later date the Supreme Court will review one of numerous state laws across the U.S. that bar abortion based on sex, race, or disability. Justice Thomas’s opinion that the Court has been zealous in protecting those who face such discrimination in other contexts gives us hope that legal protections against discrimination based on sex, race, or disability will someday be extended to unborn Americans. Countries across the globe prohibit selective abortion – and the United States should do the same” said Alyssa Farah, Press Secretary for the Vice President.",
