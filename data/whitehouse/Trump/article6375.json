Before her passing, his wife Ruth was by his side through it all—a true partner, a wonderful mother, and a fellow missionary soul.  He also built an international team and institution that will continue to carry on Christ’s message.Melania and I were privileged to get to know Reverend Graham and his extraordinary family over the last several years, and we are deeply grateful for their love and support.Billy Graham was truly one of a kind.  Christians and people of all faiths and backgrounds will miss him dearly. We are thinking of him today, finally at home in Heaven.",
