TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2020 as Great Outdoors Month.  I urge all Americans to explore the great outdoors while acting as stewards of our lands and waters.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this\ntwenty-ninth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth.DONALD J. TRUMP",
