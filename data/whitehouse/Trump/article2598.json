Trump they have someone who has not only focused on those goals, but delivered results.In a far departure from all of the work and results of this President, House Democrats have destroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus all their energy on partisan political attacks.  Their attacks on the President and his agenda are not only partisan and pathetic, they are in dereliction of their Constitutional duty.The Trump Administration will continue to be vigorous in laying out the facts and standing up for the many forgotten men and women who elected him.",
