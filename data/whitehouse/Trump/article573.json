As an advocate and an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, she was a champion for women whose tireless determination reshaped our national life. A fierce defender of her judicial philosophy, Justice Ginsburg will always be remembered as a jurist who respected and commanded the respect of all her colleagues. Karen and I offer our prayers and condolences to the family, friends, and many admirers of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.",
