These attacks on police are attacks on all Americans.These Executive Orders recognize that the most important crime-fighting measure is to stand behind the officers who are on the front lines. The people who risk their lives every day to protect Americans need to know they are supported 100 percent.That is why this first executive order will place the government firmly on the side of federal, state, tribal, and local law enforcement. This will ensure that funding supports officers on the street, and anyone who tries to do them harm will be aggressively prosecuted.The second Executive Order will instruct the Attorney General to form a task force to look at how crime can be reduced and public safety increased.The third Executive Order instructs the Attorney General to form a separate task force to focus on destroying transnational criminal organizations and drug cartels. These dangerous groups bring drugs and violence to once- peaceful neighborhoods in the United States and around the world. They have fueled addiction and fatal overdoses. They will no longer operate with impunity in this country or this hemisphere.",
