In doing so, the President fulfilled one of his most sacred duties under our Constitution.Judge Barrett is exceptionally qualified for the High Court.

Following a bipartisan vote by the Senate in 2017, Barrett was confirmed as a Federal judge.President Trump Nominates Amy Coney Barrett for the U.S. Supreme CourtSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement of support following the President’s announcement. “President Trump could not have made a better decision. Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an exceptionally impressive jurist and an exceedingly well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States.”Sen. Ted Cruz agreed, as did a number of other Senators and leaders. “Judge Barrett is well-qualified to serve on the United States Supreme Court. Having confirmed her to the circuit court in 2017 with bipartisan support, the Senate has already undertaken a thorough and rigorous review of her record,” he said.A dedicated wife and mother of seven, Judge Barrett would also bring a new and important perspective to the Court. Here are just a few examples of how:“Amy is more than a stellar scholar and judge; she is also a profoundly devoted mother,” President Trump said. “Her family is a core part of who Amy is.”Of Judge Barrett and her husband’s seven children, two were adopted from Haiti. Their youngest son, Benjamin, has Down syndrome—and boasts the title of “favorite sibling” from his brothers and sisters, according to Barrett.? WATCH: “I’m used to being in a group of nine: my family.”After President Trump announced her nomination, Judge Barrett spoke about the importance of judges putting the Constitution above any personal views on the law.“I clerked for Justice Scalia more than 20 years ago, but the lessons I learned still resonate,” she said. “His judicial philosophy is mine, too: A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold.”Judge Barrett also had a message for the American people.“I would assume this role to serve you,” she said. “I would discharge the judicial oath, which requires me to administer justice without respect to persons, do equal right to the poor and rich, and faithfully and impartially discharge my duties under the United States Constitution.”? Learn what makes Amy Coney Barrett the right choice for the Court? WATCH: President Trump’s full nomination announcement",
