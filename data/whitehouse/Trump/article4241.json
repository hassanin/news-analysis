Bush, who passed away last night.Through his essential authenticity, disarming wit, and unwavering commitment to faith, family, and country, President Bush inspired generations of his fellow Americans to public service—to be, in his words, “a thousand points of light” illuminating the greatness, hope, and opportunity of America to the world.President Bush always found a way to set the bar higher.  As a young man, he captained the Yale baseball team and served as the youngest aviator in the United States Navy during the Second World War.  Later in life, he rose to the pinnacle of American politics as a Congressman from Texas, envoy to China, Director of Central Intelligence, Vice President of eight years to President Ronald Reagan, and finally President of the United States.With sound judgement, common sense, and unflappable leadership, President Bush guided our Nation, and the world, to a peaceful and victorious conclusion of the Cold War.  As President, he set the stage for the decades of prosperity that have followed.  And through all that he accomplished, he remained humble, following the quiet call to service that gave him a clear sense of direction.Along with his full life of service to country, we will remember President Bush for his devotion to family—especially the love of his life, Barbara.  His example lives on, and will continue to stir future Americans to pursue a greater cause.  Our hearts ache with his loss, and we, with the American people, send our prayers to the entire Bush family, as we honor the life and legacy of 41.",
