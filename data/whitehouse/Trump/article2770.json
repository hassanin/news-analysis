Trump and Vice President Mike Pence received a briefing on hurricane Dorian, a potentially life threatening and extremely dangerous storm, from Acting Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management (FEMA) Pete Gaynor and Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction Dr. Neil Jacobs yesterday.  The President was provided an overview of the hurricane’s impact on Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and neighboring islands, and the ongoing response efforts there. President Trump directed Federal agencies to continue their efforts to protect lives, promote preparedness efforts, and expedite authorized assistance to areas that have been affected and are still in the path of this dangerous storm during this federally supported, State-managed, and locally executed disaster response.  The President also commended the FEMA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) teams for their hard work during this storm.  He urged Federal officials to help get the word out to those in hurricane Dorian’s path, to follow the directions of State and local officials and emergency responders, and to heed evacuation orders.  The President and Vice President are praying for those who have been affected by, and will potentially face, this hurricane.",
