Monson, a beloved President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  While serving for over half a century in the leadership of his church, President Monson demonstrated wisdom, inspired leadership, and great compassion.  Considered a prophet by the nearly 16 million members of the LDS Church, his message was one of optimism, forgiveness, and faith.  Our thoughts and prayers are with his three children and the rest of the Monson family.",
