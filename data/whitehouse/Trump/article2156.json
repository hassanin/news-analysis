Administration and consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148), as part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed about deployments of United States Armed Forces equipped for combat.MILITARY OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF UNITED STATES COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTSIn furtherance of counterterrorism efforts, the United States continues to work with partners around the globe, with a particular focus on the United States Central and Africa Commands’ areas of responsibility.  In this context, the United States has deployed forces to conduct counterterrorism operations and to advise, assist, and accompany security forces of select foreign partners on counterterrorism operations.  In the majority of these locations, the mission of the United States military personnel is to facilitate counterterrorism operations of foreign partner forces and does not include routine engagement in combat.  In many of these locations, the security environment is such that United States military personnel may be required to defend themselves against sporadic terrorist threats or attacks, and United States military personnel deploy with weapons and other appropriate equipment for their force protection.  Specific information about counterterrorism deployments to select countries is provided below, and a classified annex to this report provides further information.Military Operations against al-Qa’ida, the Taliban, and Associated Forces and in Support of Related United States Counterterrorism ObjectivesSince October 7, 2001, United States Armed Forces, including Special Operations Forces, have conducted counterterrorism combat operations against al-Qa’ida, the Taliban, and associated forces.  Since August 2014, these operations have targeted the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which was formerly known as al-Qa’ida in Iraq.  In support of these and other overseas operations, the United States has deployed combat-equipped forces to several locations in the United States Central, European, Africa, Southern, and Indo-Pacific Commands’ areas of responsibility.  Such operations and deployments have been reported previously, consistent with Public Law 107-40, Public Law 107-243, the War Powers Resolution, and other statutes.  These ongoing operations, which the United States has carried out with the assistance of numerous international partners, have been successful in seriously degrading ISIS capabilities in Syria and Iraq.  If necessary, in response to terrorist threats, I will direct additional measures to protect the people and interests of the United States.  It is not possible to know at this time the precise scope or the duration of the deployments of United States Armed Forces that are or will be necessary to counter terrorist threats to the United States.Afghanistan.  United States Armed Forces remain in Afghanistan for the purposes of stopping the reemergence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten the United States, supporting the Afghan government and the Afghan military as they confront the Taliban in the field, and creating conditions for a political process to achieve lasting peace.  United States forces in Afghanistan are training, advising, and assisting Afghan forces; conducting and supporting counterterrorism operations against al‑Qa’ida and against ISIS; and taking appropriate measures against those who provide direct support to al-Qa’ida, threaten United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan, or threaten the viability of the Afghan government or the ability of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces to achieve campaign success.  The United States remains in an armed conflict, including in Afghanistan and against the Taliban, and active hostilities remain ongoing.Iraq and Syria.  As part of a comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIS, United States Armed Forces are conducting a systematic campaign of airstrikes and other necessary operations against ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria and against al-Qa’ida in Syria.  With the territorial defeat of ISIS, I have ordered the majority of United States Armed Forces to withdraw from Syria.  A small presence of United States Armed Forces will remain in strategically significant locations in Syria to conduct operations and secure critical petroleum infrastructure, in partnership with indigenous ground forces, against continuing terrorist threats emanating from Syria.  United States Armed Forces in Iraq continue to advise, coordinate with, and provide support to select elements of the Iraqi security forces, including Iraqi Kurdish security forces.  Support to Iraqi security forces includes training, equipment, communications support, and intelligence support.  United States Armed Forces also provide limited support to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization mission in Iraq.  Actions in Iraq are being undertaken in coordination with the Government of Iraq, the Kurdistan Regional Government, and in conjunction with coalition partners.  Arabian Peninsula Region.  A small number of United States military personnel are deployed to Yemen to conduct operations against al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and ISIS.  The United States military continues to work closely with the Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) and regional partner forces to degrade the terrorist threat posed by those groups.  Since the last periodic update report, United States military forces conducted one airstrike against AQAP operatives and facilities in Yemen.United States Armed Forces, in a non-combat role, have also continued to provide military advice and limited information, logistics, and other support to regional forces combatting the Houthis in Yemen.  Such support does not involve United States Armed Forces in hostilities with the Houthis for the purposes of the War Powers Resolution.As I reported on June 11, 2019, and on November 19, 2019, United States Armed Forces are deployed to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to protect United States forces and interests in the region against hostile action by Iran or supporting groups.  These forces, operating in coordination with the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, provide air and missile defense capabilities and support the operation of United States fighter aircraft.  The total number of United States forces in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is approximately 3,000.Jordan.  At the request of the Government of Jordan, approximately 2,800 United States military personnel are deployed to Jordan to support Defeat-ISIS operations, to enhance Jordan’s security, and to promote regional stability.Lebanon.  At the request of the Government of Lebanon, approximately 60 United States military personnel are deployed to Lebanon to enhance the government’s counterterrorism capabilities and to support the counterterrorism operations of Lebanese security forces.Turkey.  United States Armed Forces remain deployed to Turkey, at the Turkish government’s request, to support Defeat-ISIS operations and to enhance Turkey’s security.East Africa Region.  In Somalia, United States Armed Forces continue to counter the terrorist threat posed by ISIS and al‑Shabaab, an associated force of al-Qa’ida.  Since the last periodic report, United States forces have conducted a number of airstrikes against ISIS and al-Shabaab.  United States military personnel also advise, assist, and accompany regional forces, including Somali and African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) forces, during counterterrorism operations.  Additional United States Armed Forces are deployed to Kenya to support counterterrorism operations in East Africa.  United States military personnel continue to partner with the Government of Djibouti, which has permitted use of Djiboutian territory for basing of United States Armed Forces.  United States military personnel remain deployed to Djibouti, including for purposes of staging for counterterrorism and counter-piracy operations in the vicinity of the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and to provide contingency support for embassy security augmentation in East Africa, as required.Libya.  Since the last periodic update report, United States Armed Forces have conducted a number of airstrikes against ISIS terrorists in Libya.  These airstrikes were conducted in coordination with the Libyan Government of National Accord.Lake Chad Basin and Sahel Region.  United States military personnel in the Lake Chad Basin and Sahel Region continue to conduct airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations and to provide support to African and European partners conducting counterterrorism operations in the region, including by advising, assisting, and accompanying these partner forces.  Approximately 800 United States military personnel remain deployed to Niger.  United States military personnel are also deployed to Cameroon, Chad, and Nigeria to support counterterrorism operations.Cuba.  United States Armed Forces continue to conduct humane and secure detention operations for detainees held at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, under the authority provided by the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40), as informed by the law of war.  There are 40 such detainees as of the date of this report.Philippines.  United States Armed Forces deployed to the Philippines are providing support to the counterterrorism operations of the armed forces of the Philippines.MILITARY OPERATIONS IN EGYPTApproximately 455 United States military personnel are assigned to or supporting the United States contingent of the Multinational Force and Observers, which have been present in Egypt since 1981.UNITED STATES AND NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION OPERATIONS IN KOSOVOThe United States continues to contribute forces to the Kosovo Force (KFOR), led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in cooperation with local authorities, bilateral partners, and international institutions, to deter renewed hostilities in Kosovo.  Approximately 600 United States military personnel are among KFOR’s approximately 4,000 personnel.I have directed the participation of United States Armed Forces in all of the above-described operations pursuant to my constitutional and statutory authority as Commander in Chief and as Chief Executive (including the authority to carry out Public Law 107-40, Public Law 107-243, and other statutes), as well as my constitutional and statutory authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States.  Officials of my Administration and I communicate regularly with congressional leadership and other Members of Congress with regard to these deployments, and we will continue to do so.Sincerely,",
