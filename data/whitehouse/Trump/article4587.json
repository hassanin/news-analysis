Trump will not tolerate the Ortega regime’s continued indiscriminate use of violence, repressive tactics, and corruption, which have worsened the economic situation of Nicaragua’s people.  The United States calls for the peaceful restoration of democracy and the rule of law in Nicaragua, which are foundational to long-term economic stability.",
