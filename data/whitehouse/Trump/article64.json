We join those around the country and the world who mourn this good and great man.Sheldon Adelson not only lived the American dream, he embodied it; a philanthropist whose generosity knew no bounds and helped shape countless worthy causes; and a businessman who changed an immeasurable number of lives.Sheldon Adelson believed deeply in America and in the importance of our historic alliance with the Jewish State of Israel. He championed the historic steps taken by our Administration to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem—a move that will further solidify America’s unbreakable bond with Israel for generations to come.When Abner fell, King David said, “Do you not know that a leader and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?” Sheldon Adelson was a leader and a great man, whose legacy will inspire generations for years to come, and he will be deeply missed by family, friends, and all of us who had the privilege to know this truly extraordinary American.To his beloved wife, Miriam, his children, and his 11 grandchildren: Karen and I extend our deepest and most heartfelt sympathy with a prayer. “May G-d comfort you among the mourners for Zion and Jerusalem” for his memory shall be a blessing for all time.",
