While our administration is encouraged that North Korea freed these innocent hostages, we will not let off the pressure until we achieve full denuclearization. Our Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did a remarkable job overseeing the release of Kim Dong Chul, Tony Kim, and Kim Hak Song – and to them I say: safe travels and welcome home. This is a proud and memorable moment for America.",
