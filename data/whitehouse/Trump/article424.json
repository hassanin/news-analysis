They’re great people and we love them.  And we’re going to be there in a little while.      And then we’re going to Florida.  We’re going to Miami, and I think we’re staying overnight in Miami.      And we’re doing very well.  The polls are looking actually great.  We’re doing very well, and we’re going to have a big victory, and I look forward to it.      And some of you are traveling with us, I guess, and some of you aren’t.     Q    Mr. President, the WTO — the WTO has given the EU —     THE PRESIDENT:  I can’t hear you.     Q    The WTO says that they’re going to give the EU a green light to put in tariffs.  Will you strike back?     THE PRESIDENT:  Say it again.     Q    In the Boeing case.  The Boeing case.      THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, we won a 7.5-billion-dollar case, and that was in — that was a great case to win, as you know.  And we’ll see what happens.  If they strike back, then we’ll strike much harder than they’ll strike.  They don’t want to do anything, I can tell you that.      But we won — we won a big case — $7.5 billion.END            12:14 P.M. EDT ",
