Trump met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in New York.  The two leaders discussed recent developments on the Korean Peninsula, including North Korea’s recent commitment to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and agreed that much hard work remains.  The two leaders reaffirmed their shared goal of achieving the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea as agreed to by Chairman Kim, noting that the responsibility is on North Korea to implement immediate measures in line with its commitment to denuclearize.  President Trump thanked Prime Minister Abe for Japan’s leadership in the international effort to enforce United Nations Security Council resolutions targeting the maritime activities of North Korea.  Both leaders committed to working with their ally, the Republic of Korea, and other international partners to maintain pressure on North Korea, including encouraging China and Russia to continue to enforce international sanctions.  The President and Prime Minister held an in-depth discussion on bilateral trade issues.  They agreed to enter into bilateral negotiations for a United States–Japan Trade Agreement.  This agreement has enormous potential to improve economic conditions in both countries and will provide significant, new market access for United States workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses.  Finally, they reiterated their firm resolve to work together to maintain a free, open, and prosperous regional order in the Indo-Pacific.",
