Whether it’s at the Southern border, in Appalachia, or any other part of the country, this program has proven to be one of the most effective tools we have against those profiting off the drug trade. The investment the Trump Administration is making in our law enforcement will help keep deadly drugs out of our communities and achieve our ultimate goal of saving lives,” ONDCP Director James Carroll said.The HIDTA Program is the Nation’s leading effort to coordinate the action and priorities of Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement partners in disrupting and dismantling drug trafficking organizations.In 2018, President Trump, through ONDCP, established the first new HIDTA program in 17 years to combat emerging threats in Alaska, bringing to completion the Administration’s effort to ensure that all 50 States receive funding through the program.In 2018, HIDTA Program initiatives:For a map of HIDTA Program Counties, click HERE.",
