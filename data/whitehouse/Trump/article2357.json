TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States do hereby proclaim November 2019 as National Family Caregivers Month.  I encourage all Americans to reach out to those who provide care for their family members, friends, and neighbors in need, to honor and thank them.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nineteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth.DONALD J. TRUMP",
