But just 500 days into his presidency, President Trump has demolished the fashionable and fatalistic theories of permanent secular stagnation.Trump is presiding over extraordinary growth. G-7 leaders should notice.\nBy National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow\nThe Washington Post\nJune 7, 2018President Trump travels to Canada to attend his second Group of Seven summit as the leader not just of the largest and fastest-growing ­G-7 economy in the world but also as the most important pro-growth reformer of our times.…Thanks to the president’s leadership, America is entering a new era of economic growth and prosperity that promises to be larger and longer than we have seen in decades.

Country after country has been putting our global trading system at risk by raising tariffs and non-tariff barriers, protecting sectors from automobiles to agriculture. So do not blame President Trump for taking decisive actions that protect our American workers.Past U.S. administrations — both Republican and Democrat — have paid only lip service to dealing with this breakdown. Not President Trump. He has shown courage and decisiveness to prevent harm to the American economy and its workforce.As a lifelong free trader myself, tariffs have not been my preferred policy tool. But at a time when nations have become so unwilling to play by the rules and restore reciprocity, tariffs are a wake-up call to the dangers of a broken trading system that is increasingly unfree.…Read the full op-ed here.",
