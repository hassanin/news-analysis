NICoE does such an amazing job treating the whole service member and their family. The doctors, social workers, physical therapists, art therapists, and music therapists all work together on every case.Today, we had the privilege of visiting Fort Belvoir in Virginia, one of several NICoE centers around the country.These centers truly understand the hidden wounds of war. They treat our soldiers who are experiencing inner trauma, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Today we participated in an art therapy session with an entire family. The art therapist knows them well and has a working relationship with the entire family. We talked color choices and what colors mean to each of us.I look forward to working with NICoE in the future.Learn more about their unique program here.Their dedication to military families is admirable. Thank you! ",
