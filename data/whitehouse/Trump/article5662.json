REPEATEDLY VINDICATED: Despite attempts to smear a dedicated intelligence officer, repeated reviews have found that Haspel did not order and was not responsible for the destruction of interrogation tapes.FALSE AND INACCURATE CHARGES: Despite repeatedly facing false or misleading allegations against her, the facts show that Haspel has served her nation honorably and acted legally.A WOMAN OF INTEGRITY: Current and former intelligence officials have attested that Haspel is “unfailingly honest,” “committed to the rule of law,” “professional,” and has a “high moral character.”",
