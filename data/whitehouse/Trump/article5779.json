This is a very proud day, and I’m thrilled to stand here and welcome Team USA to the White House. Great job. Thank you very much. What a job. (Applause.)So, two months ago, America sent each of you to the Winter Olympics to represent the Red, White, and Blue. And you did an awfully good job of doing it, I will tell you. I think she’s more famous than I am. (Laughter.) Great job.You performed and you made us very proud. And many of you came home as champions wearing a bronze, silver, or a gold medal. And you had very big crowds. And I have to say, without certain backing, those crowds were not looking good. But all of a sudden, those crowds got very, very big, very powerful, and it became a very, very successful Olympics aside from everything else.They had a lot more people show up than they thought. And you think you know why, right? But a lot of good things are happening right now over there, literally as we speak. And the Olympics really helped to bring it all together. It was a big help. So just in that respect, it was something very terrific.Through sheer drive, and dedication, and commitment, you’ve risen to the top of your fields and the highest levels of your sports. You overcame setbacks, you powered through obstacles, and you never, ever quit. Do we have any quitters here? Raise your hand, please. All right, because I was going to say, get the hell out of here. (Laughter.) No quitters in this group, huh? I had a feeling. I had a feeling that was true.You overcame setbacks, you powered through obstacles. And I will tell you this: Because of your hard work and your sacrifice, you were given the greatest honor in sports — to represent the United States as an Olympic athlete. That is really an honor. And you have to be so proud, and your families.So today, on behalf of the United States, I want to thank every Olympian and Paralympian. And what as just incredible. And what happened with the Paralympics was so incredible and so inspiring to me. And I watched — it’s a little tough to watch too much, but I watched as much as I could. It was really fantastic, and I want to thank you. You traveled all the way to South Korea and you displayed just incredible strength, representing three very beautiful letters: U-S-A. They are three beautiful letters. (Applause.)And I want to thank the members of our delegation who traveled so far on behalf of the United States and who are with us today. First of all, Vice President Pence went there and did a very good job. He was there for a reason. Right, Mike? And it was — he did a great job. He always does a great job.And Ivanka, she went there, and it was probably a little different attitude. We had two different attitudes.And Sarah Sanders — Sarah, where are you? Where’s that name, Huckabee? Don’t you put that in the middle? (Laughter.) Because your father is so good to me. I love your father. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. And she’s doing great.And Marcia Kelly. Marcia, thank you very much. Thank you very much, Marcia.My gratitude goes out to South Korea and my real warm feeling for President Moon for being such a gracious host to our delegation.On the occasion of this week’s meeting between President Moon and Kim Jong-un, I want to express my hope that all of the people of Korea — North Korea and South — can someday live in harmony, prosperity, and peace. And it looks like it could happen. When I began, people were saying that was an impossibility. They said there were two alternatives: Let them have what they have or go to war. And now we have a much better alternative than anybody thought even possible.I’ll be meeting with Kim Jong-un in the coming weeks as we seek to denuclearize the North Korean area and the entire Korean Peninsula. Hopefully, the day will come when Olympic athletes can compete on a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons, and where all Koreans can live together and can share their dreams. It would be a wonderful thing to do.Throughout the 2018 Winter Games, Team USA achieved many historic milestones. With us today are many of these incredible athletes. And they are incredible.Redmond Gerard won gold in slopestyle snowboarding. He must be a wild guy. These snowboarders are a little wild. (Laughter.) I don’t know. Where’s Redmond? Where is Redmond? Come here, Redmond. Come here. Oh, I know this guy. (Laughter and applause.) Come here.So when you’re up there doing all sorts of things, do you know what’s happening? (Laughter.) That is —MR. GERARD: I have, like, a blank mind sort of thing. You’re just hoping to land on your feet. You know?THE PRESIDENT: I think you need that, right?MR. GERARD: Yeah. Exactly.THE PRESIDENT: You are a courageous guy. Say a couple of words. (Laughter.)MR. GERARD: Come on. You can’t put me on the spot like this. Oh. Thanks for having us.THE PRESIDENT: Great job, man.MR. GERARD: Thank you so much. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Great job. (Applause.) Man. See, he was more nervous here than he was when he was doing the flips. Right? (Laughter.) You know why? Because that’s your business. That’s great. Great job. We all watched, and you’re a very special guy. Thank you very much. You’re very brave.Arielle Gold earned a bronze for her performance on the halfpipe. Where’s Arielle? Arielle. Arielle.

KRUEGER: Better, for our first game —THE PRESIDENT: Well, you came out pretty good. Right?MR. KRUEGER: Yeah, yeah. Definitely. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: Thanks, John-Henry. Appreciate it. Appreciate it. Fantastic people. (Applause.)Team USA also captured our first-ever gold medal in curling. And we met a truly amazing achievement with the members and the members of the team. And it’s really historic because nobody — I guess, nobody thought we were going to be winning in curling. Right? Is that right? Where is Tyler George, Matt Hamilton, John Landsteiner, and “Skip” John Shuster? Where are they? Where are they? Come on up here. (Applause.)MR.

ZHOU: Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: I was watching. I said, “That’s a lot of spinning.” (Laughter.)MR. ZHOU: Yeah.THE PRESIDENT: I bet they have to check it out in slow — they checked it out in slow motion because they couldn’t believe it. You know that, right? (Laughter.) Would you like to say something? Go ahead. Great job.MR. ZHOU: It’s such an honor to be here representing the United States of America. Kind of speechless right now, but thank you all so much and I’m proud to be here. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Thank you for that. Thank you, Vincent.
