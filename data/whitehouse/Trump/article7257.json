Trump applauds Congress for passing its pro-growth FY 2018 joint budget resolution and fulfilling its obligation to the American people. This resolution sets the stage for Congress to put America first by providing economic relief for the American people in the form of tax cuts and tax reform. President Trump has always made cutting taxes for hard-working American families, creating more jobs for American workers, and simplifying the rigged and burdensome tax code a priority, and he looks forward to further cooperation with Congress to advance the Administration’s pro-growth and pro-jobs agenda.",
