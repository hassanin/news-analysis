Trump was honored to host the swearing-in of Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States of America in the Rose Garden.The Swearing-in of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme CourtIn our Founders’ incredible wisdom, they gave each branch of government a different role in our Great Republic.  We have a Congress to write the laws on behalf of the people.  We have a President to enforce those laws and defend our nation.  And we have a Supreme Court to apply and interpret the law, in a fair and impartial manner, when disagreements arise.  The Founders separated power because they knew it was the best way to protect our citizens and keep our Constitution secure.Associate Justice Gorsuch’s confirmation was the culmination of a thoughtful and deliberative process that the President started almost a year ago when he released his initial list of potential nominees for the Supreme Court. In September, the President released a final, definitive list, promising to select only from those individuals who would continue the legacy of the great Justice Scalia on the bench.  And on Monday, the President celebrated our new Associate Justice who will protect our Constitution for generations.",
