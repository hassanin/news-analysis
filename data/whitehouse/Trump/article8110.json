CETPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to have with us the Prime Minister of Japan. And we have many things that we’ve been discussing and that we will continue to discuss right now and later on this afternoon.We made a lot of progress on trade and other elements. We’re also talking, obviously, about North Korea, and the problem and menace of North Korea. And the Prime Minister is — I will say this — very, very focused on what’s going on with respect to North Korea. So we will continue those discussions, and we appreciate you being here.Mr. Prime MinisterPRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) So, at the very beginning of the G20 Summit this year, we actually made a great start to attend the trilateral summits among Japan, the U.S., and the Republic of Korea, which was kindly arranged by Donald. And I was very appreciative of your initiative to hold this trilateral summit.  And also, as we are about to wrap up our discussions at the G20 Summit, it is a great pleasure for me to have our bilateral meeting with you.As I look at the current situation, particularly the security environment in the Asia Pacific region, including North Korea, we believe that it has become increasingly severe. And against such backdrop, together with you, Donald, we would like to demonstrate the robust partnership as well as the bond between Japan and the United States on this occasion.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you.END 2:56 P.M. CET",
