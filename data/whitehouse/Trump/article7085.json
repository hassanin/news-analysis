Trump applauds the Senate Finance Committee for passing its companion to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act today.  The passage of this legislation is another important step to delivering historic tax cuts and reform for hard-working families.  For far too long, the tax code has been rigged in favor of well-connected special interests.  This legislation cuts taxes for middle-income families and empowers American businesses to create more jobs, increase wages, and propel our economy toward a brighter future.  This Administration looks forward to working with Congress to make tax reform a reality by the end of the year.",
