Bush and we send our deepest sympathies to the entire Bush family. President Bush loved his family, loved this country and his legacy will be a lifetime of service to the United States of America.Beginning with his service as a Naval Aviator in WWII, where he flew 58 combat missions and was shot down over the Pacific, George H. W. Bush always answered the call to serve America.His years in Congress, as a diplomat, CIA Director and Vice President of the United States were characterized by modesty, integrity, and patriotism. His years as the 41st President of the United States left America and the world more peaceful, prosperous and secure.During this difficult time, we send our prayers and deepest condolences to the entire Bush family. We join them and the American people in mourning the passing of this good and great man. His example will always inspire and his lifetime of service will be enshrined in the hearts of the American people forever. God Bless President George H.W. Bush.”",
