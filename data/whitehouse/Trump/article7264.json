This is about doing what’s best for the Centennial State, and for all of America.Colorado needs a tax cut, and Trump’s plan will deliver\nVice President Mike Pence\nThe Denver Post\nOctober 25, 2017…To usher in a new era of more jobs, higher wages and greater opportunity, Trump is committed to sign a historic tax cut — this year.On Thursday, I will visit Denver, and one of the messages I will bring is that our administration’s tax-cut plan is vitally important to the Centennial State. It will put more money back in the pockets of working families and put job creators on the path to a brighter future.…Our current tax system takes too much of working Americans’ hard-earned money.

President Trump and I call on all of Colorado’s representatives and senators to support our tax-cut plan.Tax reform has brought both parties together before, and it should bring them together today. This is about doing what’s best for the Centennial State, and for all of America.…Read the full op-ed here.",
