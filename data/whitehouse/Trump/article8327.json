Trump’s agenda to promote job creation and grow the U.S. economy. America’s infrastructure has fallen to 12th in the world and that is unacceptable. Every American depends on our roads, rails, ports, and airports, and the President is committed to fixing this problem, not just pushing more liabilities onto future generations. Today, the President was in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he announced his infrastructure initiative.President Trump’s regulatory reforms will spur growth and investment. In order to jumpstart investment, the President aims to dramatically reduce permitting time for these infrastructure projects from 10 years to 2 years and to get a “yes” or “no” quickly by slashing regulations.The President’s plan will make America dominant by unleashing private sector capital and expertise to rebuild our cities and states.The President has dedicated $200 billion in his budget for infrastructure that can be leveraged for a $1 trillion investment into our crumbling systems. Investing in rural infrastructure is a key part of the President’s plan.The President’s plan will also invest in bold new transformative projects that will change America’s approach to infrastructure.The President’s plan will also make America ready for the future with a work-force training initiative focused on skill-based apprenticeship education.President Trump’s plan addresses these challenges directly and implements new policies to make America’s infrastructure second to none.",
