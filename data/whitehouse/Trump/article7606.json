At the start of the event, Mrs. Pence delivered welcome remarks to the group of leaders in the field of creative arts therapies, the military, government and academia.“Military service members and Veterans deserve opportunities to heal from injuries sustained while fighting to protect our freedoms,” said Mrs. Pence. “I applaud the Creative Forces NEA Healing Arts Network for what they are doing to help us better understand the biological, psychological, behavioral, and economic impacts of creative arts therapies in integrative care settings for patients with traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress.”“We are deeply honored that Second Lady Karen Pence is hosting the kickoff event for the NEA’s Creative Forces Clinical Research Summit,” said NEA Chairman Jane Chu. “Her generosity today and her leadership in art therapy make a real difference to those of us committed to advancing art therapy for the benefit of military personnel and their families.”The Second Lady chose one initiative to champion, and it is art therapy. As part of her initiative, she will advocate for the conducting of more research showing the scientific and medical benefits of art therapy treatment.
