On current course next year’s election will not be legitimate, free, or fair.The Cambodian government still has time to reverse course.  We call on the Royal Government of Cambodia to undo its recent actions against the CNRP, release imprisoned CNRP leader Kem Sokha, and allow opposition parties, civil society, and the media to maintain their legitimate activities.",
