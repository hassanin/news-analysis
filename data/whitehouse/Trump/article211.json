ONDCP thanks the many domestic and international partners who supported us in reaching this moment, including the U.S. Helsinki Commission, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency here at home, and independent organizations like Global Athlete and FairSport abroad. Bad actors who enable unfair competition should face legal consequences — a position shared by President Trump, legislators on both sides of the aisle in the United States, and athletes around the world.”",
