Implementing this executive order would have a de minimis impact on costs and revenues to the Federal Government. The benefits of this executive order include the promotion of a simple, fair, efficient, and pro-growth tax system, and the eventual elimination of unnecessarily burdensome tax regulations. It would have a de minimis impact on mandatory and discretionary obligations and outlays, as well as on revenues to the Federal Government, in the 5-fiscal year period beginning in fiscal year 2017. The agencies anticipated to be affected by this order are the Department of the Treasury and the Executive Office of the President.",
