    "content": "\n\t\t\t\tStatements & Releases\t\t\t\nIssued on:\nJuly 10, 2018\nWe applaud the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee for the overwhelming, bipartisan vote to favorably report Robert Wilkie to be the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Mr. Wilkie’s service as Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel & Readiness; Committee testimony; and previous Senate confirmations, most recently last fall by unanimous consent, demonstrate his stellar qualifications for this role.  President Donald J. Trump remains committed to ensuring our Nation’s heroes receive the care they deserve, and he is confident that Mr. Wilkie will continue the Administration’s important work on behalf of the veterans community.  We look forward to the full Senate confirming him as soon as possible.",
