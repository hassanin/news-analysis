Trump delivered a powerful address on combating drug demand and the opioid crisis. Due to a lack of attention for nearly a decade, this tragedy has devastated Americans and America’s communities for far too long. The President has prioritized these crucial issues by declaring a nationwide public health emergency.The President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis has submitted its final report, recommending how the Federal Government can address the drug addiction and opioid crisis. We are grateful for the Commission’s extensive work since March, and look forward to reviewing these recommendations as the entire Administration continues to work to lessen drug demand and the opioid crisis.",
