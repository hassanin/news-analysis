By being the first head of state to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to open an embassy there on May 14, 2018, President Trump reprised the role President Truman played 70 years ago when he was the first to recognize the State of Israel. We look forward to welcoming many more of our friends and allies in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel.",
