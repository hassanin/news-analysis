Kennedy for his thirty years of distinguished service on the Supreme Court of the United States.  In 1987, President Reagan nominated him to the Court, and he was swiftly confirmed without opposition.  A Californian—like the President who appointed him—Justice Kennedy is a true man of letters.  During his tenure on the Court, he authored landmark opinions in every significant area of constitutional law, most notably on equal protection under the law, the separation of powers, and the First Amendment’s guarantees of freedom of speech and religion.Justice Kennedy has been a tireless voice for individual rights and the Founders’ enduring vision of limited government.  His words have left an indelible mark not only on this generation, but on the fabric of American history.",
