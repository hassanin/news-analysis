Circuit affirmed a signature initiative of the Trump Administration, which ensures that American patients have access to the hospital pricing information they need when they need it, beginning on January 1. This transformative hospital price transparency rule has been fought at every step by the swamp and defenders of the status quo. Today’s ruling should reassure the American people that President Donald J. Trump refuses to bow to the influence of special interests who would prefer to keep patients in the dark. This initiative is just one in a series of rules that will bring unprecedented price transparency to all elements of healthcare.",
