Trump’s healthcare vision is putting America first by providing higher quality healthcare at a lower cost for patients.  Since taking office, the President has been committed to putting healthcare back in the hands of the American people—where it belongs.  The Trump Administration has taken unprecedented actions to lower prescription drug prices, end surprise medical billing, reduce the price of insulin, protect people with pre-existing conditions, and allow the American people to keep their doctors.  This bold and dynamic plan is providing the hard-working men and women of our country more choice, better care, and lower cost.  For more on the President’s America First Healthcare Plan, click here.",
