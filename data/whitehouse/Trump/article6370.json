She played the keyboard, and I helped with percussion! Great fun.Mrs. Pence Participates in Music TherapyBut while participating, unknowingly to us, the music therapy session was actually helping Maya manage pain. She shared that the sessions are helping her to deal with pain. After meeting with the music therapist, Nicole, she takes the keyboard back to her room where she can use it whenever she begins to feel pain.Her mother shared in a roundtable afterward that this therapy has been especially helpful for Maya. And she looks forward to Maya using the family piano when she transitions home.I am honored to have this national and international platform to shine the light on art therapy. I hope you continue to follow along, as I will share stories about my visits across the United States and around the world to elevate art therapy.Art therapy is near and dear to my heart.
