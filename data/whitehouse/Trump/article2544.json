Those thought to have Down syndrome also risk being subjected to the too-often terminations of their lives before birth.Each year, approximately 6,000 babies are born in the United States with Down syndrome.  Though these newborns will experience many challenges, American innovation and research are helping these beautiful souls lead independent, full, and happy lives.  My Administration is dedicated to fostering opportunities for persons with Down syndrome, so they are better able to participate in our workforce and pursue their dreams.Every human life possesses immeasurable value, and my Administration will continue to embrace and defend the inherent truth that all of God’s children should be loved and cherished.  This month is an important opportunity for Americans to reaffirm our commitment to creating a society that better appreciates and respects the dignity of life at all of its beautiful and miraculous stages.  We must devote our efforts to ensure that the United States continues to exhibit reverence for human life—both born and unborn.  Together, we can create an inclusive Nation, one where Americans with Down syndrome are embraced in schools, workplaces, and communities—one where discrimination can no longer cast a shadow of inequality.Our country is incredibly enriched by Americans with Down syndrome.  As a Nation, we are inspired by the spirit and exuberant joy with which these treasured Americans live each day.",
