Papers 3118, 3119 (Dec. 17, 2004); Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Accordingly, the executive branch will construe and implement the Act in a manner consistent with this constitutional grant of authority to the President, as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.Further, section 6 of the Act requires a report from the Director of National Intelligence that includes “a review of whether the schedule for processing security clearances under section 3001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (50 U.S.C. 3341) should be modified.”  The executive branch will implement this provision in a manner consistent with the principles set forth above and with the President’s constitutional authority to recommend to the Congress such measures as the President considers to be necessary and expedient.DONALD J.
