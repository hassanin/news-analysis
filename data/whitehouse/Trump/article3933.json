However, without access to reliable high-speed broadband, too many Americans are being left out of those opportunities. This is particularly true in rural America, where nearly 39 percent of Americans lack sufficient broadband access.Today, we are pleased to announce the American Broadband Initiative (ABI) report, reflecting the work of a multi-agency effort to remove barriers to broadband deployment. Under the leadership of the White House, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce, the American Broadband Initiative is based on a fundamental principle: nothing drives innovation more effectively than unleashing the free market economy.While a lot of work remains to be done, today’s report represents a significant step forward toward delivering the modern broadband infrastructure that all Americans deserve.",
