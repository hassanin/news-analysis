These four men each stand convicted of horrendous acts of violence — including the brutal rape and murder of children. Each criminal was first convicted and sentenced for their offenses more than fifteen years ago. Thanks to the leadership of Attorney General Barr, the families and communities of the victims will finally receive some long-overdue justice.",
