TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 7 through May 13, 2017, as Public Service Recognition Week.  I call upon Americans and all Federal, State, tribal, and local government agencies to recognize the dedication of our Nation’s public servants and to observe this week through appropriate programs and activities.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.DONALD J. TRUMP",
