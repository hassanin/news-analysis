At the First Lady’s direction, the design was carefully conceived in order to compliment the architecture of the Executive Mansion, drawing inspiration from both the East and the West wings.“As we break ground on the new tennis pavilion, it is a great honor to share this moment alongside the many talented individuals and craftsmen involved in bringing it to fruition,” said First Lady Melania Trump.  “Architectural inspiration for the pavilion is drawn from the White House, with the end goal of the new structure on the south lawn complementing and contributing to the People’s house.  It is my hope that this private space will function as a place to gather and spend leisure time for First Families.”",
