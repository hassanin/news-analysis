Section 104(b)(2)(A) of the Act would require a Task Force established within the executive branch to engage with foreign governments to achieve certain specified ends. This provision interferes with my exclusive authority under Article II of the Constitution to conduct the Nation’s foreign affairs. Accordingly, my Administration will treat it as advisory and non-binding.DONALD J. TRUMP",
