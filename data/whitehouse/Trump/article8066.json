In other words, we’ll be taking something away from the federal government and getting it back to the states, who can better provide and who know better what to do.It provides generous funding for people with expensive health conditions, which will lower premiums in the individual market.The bill doubles the amount that Americans can contribute to tax-free Health Savings Accounts and allows you to use those accounts to pay your premiums.This plan provides states with the much-needed flexibility to better manage their Medicaid programs. It maintains Medicaid coverage for every single elderly American, disabled American, and American child who is currently on the program.It also expands the opportunity for people on Medicaid to purchase a private plan with federal financial assistance.And with these much needed, long-term reforms to strengthen the safety net for our neediest citizens, the Obamacare repeal and replace plan would significantly reduce the federal deficit. So it would be good for the federal government, it’ll cost you less money by a lot, and it will be a much better plan. You can’t do better than that.When I ran for President, I made a commitment to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare.I am pleased to report that we are very, very close to ending this healthcare nightmare – we are so close.The legislation working its way through Congress provides the choice and control people want, the affordability they need, and the quality they deserve in healthcare.It’s a common sense approach that restores the sacred doctor-patient relationship. And you are going to finally have great healthcare at a lower price.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",
