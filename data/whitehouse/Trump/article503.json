THINK. CONNECT. campaign.  All devices are potentially vulnerable.  But you can greatly enhance the safety of your personal information and that of your family, friends, and employers by adhering to the advice offered by the campaign and improving your cyber hygiene.NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2020 as National Cybersecurity Awareness Month.  I call upon the people, companies, and institutions of the United States to recognize the importance of cybersecurity and to observe this month through events, training, and education to further our country’s national security and resilience.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.",
