Trump announced the recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching (PAEMST) and the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM).Awardees come from schools in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools, and schools in the United States territories of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands.  Nominations and awards are facilitated by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the National Science Foundation.  The individuals and organizations announced today are 2017 and 2018 Awardees.Presidential award for K-12 teachersEstablished in 1983, PAEMST is the highest award given by the U.S. Government to kindergarten through 12th grade teachers of mathematics and science, including computer science.A panel of distinguished mathematicians, scientists, and educators at the State and national levels assess the applications before recommending nominees to OSTP.  Teachers are selected based on their distinction in the classroom and dedication to improving science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education.Presidential award for STEM mentorsPAESMEM recognizes the critical roles mentors play outside the traditional classroom setting in the academic and professional development of the future STEM workforce.Colleagues, administrators, and students nominate individuals and organizations for exemplary mentoring sustained over a minimum of five years.  Since 1995, PAESMEM has honored the hard work and dedication which mentors exhibit in broadening participation in the STEM pipeline.Mentors support learners from kindergarten through the collegiate levels, as well as those who recently started their careers in STEM.  Mentors share their expertise and guidance with learners, sometimes through formal mentoring programs.  Learners are often from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM.Recipients of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching:Alabama\nKristin Bundren, Spain Park High School\nSue Noah, Athens Elementary School\nKevin Pughsley, Berry Middle School\nLorie White, Rogers High SchoolAlaska\nJennifer Childress, Dimond High School\nJoshua Hall, Dimond High School\nDawn Wilcox, Campbell STEM Elementary\nAngie Wright, Auke Bay Elementary SchoolArizona\nSvea Anderson, Agua Caliente Elementary School\nAmee Legarra, Richardson Elementary School\nDeborah Nipar, Hamilton High School\nNicole Whitt, Empire High SchoolArkansas\nCorey Boby, Benton High School\nCheri DeSoto, Holt Middle School\nAnna Shaw, J.O.
