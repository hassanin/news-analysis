Trump signed an Executive Order titled “Coordinating National Resilience to Electromagnetic Pulses.”  This Executive Order advances increased resilience to Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) events by directing better data gathering, testing, and private-sector coordination to implement protective measures.  The Executive Order also instructs departments and agencies to coordinate and streamline these efforts, while fostering an environment, through strong Administration leadership, that promotes private-sector innovation to strengthen our critical infrastructure.President Trump will always do what it takes to keep Americans safe.  Today’s Executive Order – the first ever to establish a comprehensive policy to improve resilience to EMPs – is one more example of how the Administration is keeping its promise to always be vigilant against present dangers and future threats.",
