McGahn II.The court recognized the long history, dating back to President George Washington, of presidents of all parties resisting improper information requests from Congress and rightly held that it is not the role of the courts to referee such inter-branch disputes.  House Democrats went so far as to impeach the President on a wholly partisan basis in part for resisting their improper efforts to compel testimony from senior administration officials such as Mr. McGahn.  The President was completely vindicated by his acquittal in the Senate trial, and his legal position resisting House Democrats’ lawsuit has now been vindicated by the courts as well.We hope and expect that yesterday’s decision will put to rest House Democrats’ desperate, unfounded, and unlawful attacks against President Trump so that Congress can, at long last, turn its attention to joining with the Administration to work for the American people.",
