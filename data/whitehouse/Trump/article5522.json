Optimism about the availability of good jobs has grown by 25 percentage points since Donald Trump was elected president.Gallup has asked Americans to say whether it is a good time or bad time to find a quality job monthly since August 2001. Prior to 2017, the percentage saying “good time” never reached 50%, but since Trump took office in January that year, the percentage has stayed at or above 50% and has been higher than 60% in eight of the past nine months.During the presidency of Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, the percentage of Americans who thought it was a bad time to find a quality job outweighed the percentage who thought it was a good time until the final weeks he was in office.…Optimism Rises Among All Age, Income, Education GroupsAmericans of in all age [sic], income and education groups are decidedly more positive about the job market now than before Trump’s election, and as that has happened, the previous major differences by age and education have shrunk or disappeared.…With unemployment continuing to drop, Americans now survey the job market with a higher level of confidence that jobs are available and that the jobs are ones worth having.Read the full article here.",
