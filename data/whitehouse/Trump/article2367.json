    "content": "\n\t\t\t\tStatements & Releases\t\t\t\nIssued on:\nOctober 29, 2019\nThe resolution put forward by Speaker Pelosi confirms that House Democrats’ impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote.It continues this scam by allowing Chairman Schiff, who repeatedly lies to the American people, to hold a new round of hearings, still without any due process for the President.The White House is barred from participating at all, until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee.  Even then, the White House’s rights remain undefined, unclear, and uncertain – because those rules still haven’t been written.This resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the Administration.",
