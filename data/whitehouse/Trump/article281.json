In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in Burundi declared in Executive Order 13712 of November 22, 2015, is to continue in effect beyond November 22, 2020.The situation in Burundi, which has been marked by killing and other violence against civilians, unrest, the incitement of violence, and significant political repression, and which threatens the peace, security, and stability of Burundi and the region, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. I commend the new government and the people of Burundi for the recent historic peaceful transfer of power and encourage the new government to continue to engage with the United States and other countries to address the underlying actions and policies of the Government of Burundi that led to the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 13712. At this time, however, I have not seen sufficient evidence that the situation is resolved. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13712 with respect to the situation in Burundi.Sincerely,DONALD J. TRUMP",
