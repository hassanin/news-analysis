Res. 49.  As Americans, we condemn the recent violence in Charlottesville and oppose hatred, bigotry, and racism in all forms.  No matter the color of our skin or our ethnic heritage, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God.  We are a Nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal.  As one people, let us move forward to rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.",
