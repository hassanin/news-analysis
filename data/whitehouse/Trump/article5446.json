Trump signed two proclamations, which note that measures are in place to address the impairment to the national security threatened by imports of steel and aluminum from Argentina, Brazil, and Australia.At this time, similar measures are not in place with respect to steel or aluminum imports from Mexico, Canada, or the European Union.  Therefore, as of June 1, 2018, tariffs will no longer be suspended for steel or aluminum imports from those countries.  The Administration will continue discussions with them and remains open to discussions with other countries.The Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs have already had major, positive effects on steel and aluminum workers and jobs and will continue to do so long into the future.  At the same time, the Trump Administration’s actions underscore its commitment to good-faith negotiations with our allies to enhance our national security while supporting American workers.The Administration will continue to monitor steel and aluminum imports and adjust the measures in effect as necessary to protect the national security of the United States.",
