For far too long, California has obstructed Federal law and put the interests of criminal aliens ahead of the well-being of American citizens.When a foreign national in the United States illegally is arrested on criminal charges, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can issue a “detainer,” a request that local law enforcement notify ICE before the illegal alien is released from custody. As a Sanctuary State, California refuses to honor these detainers and instead releases criminal aliens back onto the streets.This policy of mass recalcitrance to lawful Federal authority not only puts innocent and law-abiding Americans at risk, but it also endangers the lives of the rank-and-file law enforcement officers charged with keeping our communities safe.Below are just a few examples of the dangerous criminal aliens that California has set free, despite the lawful requests of immigration authorities.",
