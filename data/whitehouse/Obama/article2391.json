We also condemn the senseless motorcycle bomb attack near a police station in Istanbul on Thursday that was claimed by the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, the PKK's urban terrorist unit. This attack is just the latest in a deeply concerning trend of increasing violence by the PKK, which has killed both security personnel and civilians throughout Turkey. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of those killed, and we wish a speedy recovery to those injured. We remain steadfast in our support for our NATO ally, Turkey, and reaffirm our commitment to continue working together to defeat all forms of terrorism.\n\n\t###\n\n\n\n\n"
