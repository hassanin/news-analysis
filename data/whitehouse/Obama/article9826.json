In Bosnia, the United States – our troops and our diplomats – led the international effort to end ethnic cleansing and bring a lasting peace. On this important day, we recommit ourselves to supporting ongoing reconciliation efforts in the Balkans and to working to prevent future atrocities.  Those who have committed crimes against humanity and genocide will not escape judgment.   \n\n\tMay the families of Mladic’s victims find some solace in today’s arrest, and may this deepen the ties among the people of the region.\n\n\n\n\n"
