    "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House\nOffice of the Vice President\n\n\nFor Immediate Release\nMay 30, 2015\n\n \n\n\n\nStatement by the Vice President\n\n\n\n\nIt is with broken hearts that Hallie, Hunter, Ashley, Jill and I announce the passing of our husband, brother and son, Beau, after he battled brain cancer with the same integrity, courage and strength he demonstrated every day of his life.\nThe entire Biden family is saddened beyond words. We know that Beau’s spirit will live on in all of us—especially through his brave wife, Hallie, and two remarkable children, Natalie and Hunter. \nBeau's life was defined by service to others. As a young lawyer, he worked to establish the rule of law in war-torn Kosovo. A major in the Delaware National Guard, he was an Iraq War veteran and was awarded the Bronze Star. As Delaware’s Attorney General, he fought for the powerless and made it his mission to protect children from abuse.\nMore than his professional accomplishments, Beau measured himself as a husband, father, son and brother. His absolute honor made him a role model for our family. Beau embodied my father's saying that a parent knows success when his child turns out better than he did.\nIn the words of the Biden family: Beau Biden was, quite simply, the finest man any of us have ever known.\n\n\n\n\n"
