Entrepreneurs, corporations, and ordinary Americans can build value on top of this raw material into applications that will improve our quality of life.”\nEach of the 24 major government departments and agencies, together with several small and independent agencies, have uploaded information to Data.gov, in accordance with the Administration’s Open Government Directive issued in December 2009.  That directive established an unprecedented standard for government agencies, insisting that they achieve key milestones in transparency, collaboration, and participation.\nAs part of the data published today, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is issuing user-friendly information about the ease of use for child safety seats.  While the safety data is already available, consumers now will be able to access the ratings focused on the ease of utilizing instructions, reading labels, installing the seat, and securing the child.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is publishing information that previously cost a person $100 to acquire.  The data will provide detailed breakdowns on the volume of physician services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries and the payments for those services.  Information will be sortable by the type of medical service provided and by state.  The data can be used to look at patterns of Medicare spending, the medical challenges facing a state or a population, or the types of services delivered to meet specific conditions. \nWith the first stage of the Open Government Directive completed, attention turns to step two:  each agency is creating a website to serve as the gateway for agency open government activities.  In addition, Chopra and Kundra soon will launch an open government dashboard to track agencies’ progress to increase transparency and public participation in their operations.  The deadline for those activities is February 6, 2010.\n\n\n\n"
