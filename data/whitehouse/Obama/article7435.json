As this is the President’s fourth trip to Mexico and his sixth trip to the region, he noted that this is an important opportunity to reinforce the deep cultural, familial, and economic ties that so many Americans share with Mexico and Central America. The President said that he is looking forward to talking with Latin American leaders about our vision for the Americas as a region of shared opportunity. He emphasized that the long term trends in the hemisphere are clearly moving in the right direction, with growing middle classes, declining poverty and inequality in much of the region, and countries such as Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia taking a more active global role. At the meeting, the President made clear that immigration reform continues to be a top legislative priority this year.\n\t \n\tParticipants in the meeting included:\n\n\n\t\tDavid Ayon, U.S. Director, Focus Mexico/Enfoque México\n\n\t\tJose Calderon, President, Hispanic Federation\n\n\t\tYanira Cruz, President and CEO, National Hispanic Council on Aging\n\n\t\tJanet Murguia, President and CEO, National Council of La Raza (NCLR)\n\n\t\tAna Navarro, CNN/CNN-E Political Contributor, National Political Advisor for Politic365.com, Republican Advisor\n\n\t\tJavier Palomarez, U.
