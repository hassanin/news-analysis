But as a whole, this package will grow our economy, create jobs, and help middle class families across the country.  As this bill moves to the House of Representatives, I hope that members from both parties can come together in a spirit of common purpose to protect American families and our economy as a whole by passing this essential economic package.\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
