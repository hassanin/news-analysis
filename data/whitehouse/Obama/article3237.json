Globally, more than 62 million girls are not in school - more than half of whom are adolescent - because of complex physical, cultural, and financial barriers in accessing education. When a girl receives a quality education, she is more likely to earn a decent living, raise a healthy, educated family, and improve the quality of life for herself, her family, and her community.\n\nIn case you missed it: Today, the Peace Corps announced 23 New Let Girls Learn countries.
