Monti   WASHINGTON – On Thursday, September 17th, the President will award Sergeant First Class Jared C. Monti, U.S. Army, the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.

Then-Staff Sergeant Monti displayed immeasurable courage and uncommon valor - eventually sacrificing his own life in an effort to save his comrade. Sergeant First Class Monti’s parents, Paul Monti and Janet Monti, will join the President at the White House to commemorate their son’s example of selfless service and sacrifice. PERSONAL BACKGROUND: Jared C. Monti was born on September 20, 1975. He was a native of Raynham, Massachusetts. He graduated from Bridgewater-Raynham High School.
