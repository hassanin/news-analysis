Our condolences go out to the United Nations personnel, African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) soldiers, Somali citizens, and friends and families of all those who were killed and injured in this cowardly attack.Â \nThe United States stands squarely with Somalia and our partners in the fight against despicable acts of terrorism that seek to destabilize Somalia. We remain committed to helping Somalia progress along a path towards peace and prosperity and the defeat of terrorist groups, including al-Shabaab.\n\n\n\n\n"
