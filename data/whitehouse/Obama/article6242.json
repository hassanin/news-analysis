The two leaders expressed firm support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, and consulted on steps to lead to a de-escalation of the situation and peaceful resolution. The Vice President welcomed the conclusions of the European Council on March 6, which sent a strong signal that Russia’s military actions in Crimea are unacceptable. Finally, the Vice President also applauded the resumption of U.N.-led talks to achieve a just and lasting Cyprus settlement and re-affirmed the United States’ full support for the Cypriot-led process, under the auspices of the United Nations Good Offices Mission.\n\n\n\n\n"
