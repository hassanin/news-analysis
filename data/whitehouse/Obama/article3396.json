The willingness of our troops to complete dangerous training to prepare for any mission our nation asks of them will not be forgotten.\n\nThe spirit of our missing Marines was reflected in the actions of the many dozens of service members and others in Hawaii who searched day-and-night for the downed helicopters.\n\nCommunities from coast-to-coast are mourning these Marines, and our nation is forever grateful for their patriotism, service, and sacrifice.  Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones at this difficult hour.\n\n\n\n\n"
