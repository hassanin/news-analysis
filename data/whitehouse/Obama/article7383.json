NTC was recently recognized for the second consecutive year by the Aspen Institute College Excellence Program as being one of the top 120 community colleges in the United States, in part because of its graduation rate near 80 percent.\nNTC offers 20 certificate programs, 15 associate degrees, and six baccalaureate degrees to a student population of nearly 1,800 students. Many of the programs at NTC are designed to help create new jobs and economic opportunities on or near the Navajo Nation, while equipping their students with the skills they need to succeed in those jobs.  Through this approach, NTC has developed partnerships and collaborations with other universities, including Arizona State University, the private sector, and federal agencies.\nThe commencement, including Dr. Biden’s remarks, will be live streamed at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/navajo-tech-crownpoint-nm.\n\n\n\n\n"
