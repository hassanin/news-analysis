During my Administration, Federal agencies have reduced their annual greenhouse gas emissions by more than 15 percent (7.8 million metric tons) -- the equivalent of removing 1.5 million cars from the road. Today I am establishing new goals for renewable energy as well as new energy-management practices.\nAgencies are already well on their way towards meeting the aggressive sustainability goals set forth in Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009 (Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance). This memorandum establishes a new target for Federal use of renewable energy that challenges agencies to more than double their renewable electricity consumption. In order to improve their ability to manage energy consumption, promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and achieve the sustainability goals set forth in Executive Order 13514, this memorandum also directs agencies to update their building-performance and energy-management practices, by encouraging the use of the consensus-based, industry-standard Green Button data access system (Green Button) and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Energy Star Portfolio Manager.\nTo help agencies achieve my Administration's climate change goals and increase development of new renewable energy sources, I hereby direct the following:\nSection 1. Renewable Energy Target. (a) By fiscal year 2020, to the extent economically feasible and technically practicable, 20 percent of the total amount of electric energy consumed by each agency during any fiscal year shall be renewable energy.\n(b) Agencies shall seek to achieve the renewable energy consumption target set forth in subsection (a) of this section by, where possible, taking the following actions, which are listed in order of priority:\n(i) installing agency-funded renewable energy on-site at Federal facilities and retain renewable energy certificates;\n(ii) contracting for energy that includes the installation of a renewable energy project on-site at a Federal facility or off-site from a Federal facility and the retention of renewable energy certificates for the term of the contract;\n(iii) purchasing electricity and corresponding renewable energy certificates; and\n(iv) purchasing renewable energy certificates.\n(c) Agencies shall ensure that 100 percent of renewable energy certificates identified in subsection (b)(iii) and (b)(iv) of this section are produced by new renewable sources as defined in section 5(c) of this memorandum.\n(d) Agencies shall consider opportunities, to the extent economically feasible and technically practical, to install or contract for energy installed on current or formerly contaminated lands, landfills, and mine sites.\nSec. 2. Accounting for Renewable Energy. (a) For the purposes of the renewable energy consumption target in section 1(a) of this memorandum, agency progress shall be determined by reference to the ownership of renewable energy certificates for electric energy consumed.\n(b) The percentage of renewable energy counted towards the target in section 1 of this memorandum shall be doubled if the renewable energy conforms with section 203(c)(1) through (3) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15852(c)(1)-(3)).\n(c) In order to achieve the target set forth in section 1(a) of this memorandum, each agency shall ensure that the percentage of the total amount of electric energy consumed by that agency that is renewable energy is:\n(i) not less than 10 percent in fiscal year 2015;\n(ii) not less than 15 percent in fiscal years 2016 and 2017;\n(iii) not less than 17.5 percent in fiscal years 2018 and 2019; and\n(iv) not less than 20 percent in fiscal year 2020 and each fiscal year thereafter.\n(d) For the purposes of accounting for the generation of renewable energy not included in section 1(b) of this memorandum, such as thermal and hydrokinetic renewable energy and renewable energy generated on a Federal facility or Federal land, the renewable energy and its estimated contribution to meeting greenhouse gas emission reduction goals set forth in section 2(a)(ii) of Executive Order 13514 shall be reported in MWh and be measured against reported total electricity consumption.\n(e) In preparing Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans required under section 8 of Executive Order 13514, agencies shall report on:\n(i) progress towards meeting the agency renewable energy targets established in section 1(a) of this memorandum; and\n(ii) the actions taken pursuant to sections 1(b) and 2(d) of this memorandum.\n(f) Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, the Department of Energy will issue an update to its Renewable Energy Requirement Guidance for EPACT 2005 and Executive Order 13423 to address the new requirements created by this memorandum.\nSec. 3. Building Performance and Energy Management. (a) To encourage continuous improvement and better manage building performance, enhance energy efficiency, and reduce energy waste in an open and transparent way, each agency shall:\n(i) install building energy meters and sub-meters as required by section 543(e) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA) (42 U.S.C. 8253(e)), and continue installation of additional building energy meters and sub-meters where cost-effective and appropriate;\n(ii) install water meters at agency buildings where cost-effective and appropriate;\n(iii) ensure that for any agency buildings metered for energy and water performance, the associated monthly performance data is entered into the EPA Energy Star Portfolio Manager to better manage energy performance and allow for benchmarking;\n(iv) publicly disclose annual benchmark energy performance data through the Department of Energy web-based tracking system established under section 543(f)(7)(B) of NECPA (42 U.S.C. 8253(f)(7)(B));\n(v) where feasible, incorporate Green Button into reporting, data analytics and automation, and processes, in consultation with local utilities; and\n(vi) consider participating in demand response programs where available.\n(b) To facilitate agency management of energy usage information in Green Button:\n(i) within 120 days of the date of this memorandum, the General Services Administration (GSA), in coordination with the Department of Energy (DOE) and EPA, shall prepare and initiate a strategy to pilot Green Button at Federal facilities where feasible;\n(ii) within 180 days of initiation of the Green Button pilot strategy described in paragraph (i) of this subsection, DOE, through the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), in coordination with EPA, shall issue guidance on the use of the Green Button at Federal facilities; and\n(iii) as soon as practicable, but no later than 1 year after the date of this memorandum, EPA shall update Energy Star Portfolio Manager to facilitate the inclusion of building energy usage data using Green Button and in conformance with the guidance prepared pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this subsection.\n(c) To support agency metering and benchmarking, and to promote disclosure of agency building energy usage, within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, DOE, through FEMP, shall:\n(i) revise and update the Metering Best Practices of August 2011, which shall include definitions for the terms \"cost effective\" and \"appropriate\" and shall address leased space so that, where submetering allows, energy and water consumption data will be reported; and\n(ii) in coordination with EPA, revise and update the Building Energy Use Benchmarking Guidance of April 15, 2010, including necessary revisions to benchmark building performance data fields and disclosure policies.\nSec. 4. Applicability of Renewable Energy Certificates to Federal Target. Within 120 days of the date of this memorandum, DOE, through FEMP, and in coordination with the EPA, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, GSA, and other agencies as appropriate, shall provide recommendations to the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality on procurement, reporting, and accounting procedures related to agency use of renewable energy certificates in meeting the target in section 1(a) of this memorandum, including procedures and policies on:\n(a) appropriate certification and tracking of renewable energy certificates; and\n(b) sale and purchase of renewable energy certificates, including the exchange of project-related renewable energy certificates and interagency and interdepartmental purchase and transfer of renewable energy certificates.\nSec. 5.
