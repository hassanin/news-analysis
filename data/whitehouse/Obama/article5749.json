In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to North Korea that was declared in Executive Order (E.O.) 13466 of June 26, 2008, expanded in scope in E.O. 13551 of August 30, 2010, and addressed further in E.O. 13570 of April 18, 2011, is to continue in effect beyond June 26, 2014.\nThe existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, and the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea that destabilize the Korean Peninsula and imperil U.S. Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners in the region, continue to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to North Korea.\nBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
