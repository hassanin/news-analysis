He discussed raising expectations for students and schools, boosting teacher effectiveness, and providing greater flexibility to support innovation and improvements throughout public education – including fostering a Race to the Top in our schools and providing incentives and rewards  to help students make significant strides and succeed.  The President looks forward to continuing this vital, bipartisan work to ensure America’s students have the skills they need to out-educate and out-compete the world and win the future.\n\t \n\t* Representatives John Kline, George Miller, Duncan Hunter, and Dale Kildee were called back to Congress for a vote, they departed before the meeting began.\n\n\n\n\n"
