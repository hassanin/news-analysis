HAMILTON is based on Ron Chernow’s biography of Alexander Hamilton.\n\n\tIn May of 2009, the President and First Lady hosted an event celebrating poetry, music and the spoken word, where Lin-Manuel Miranda performed “The Hamilton Mixtape,” which was later renamed “Alexander Hamilton” and became the opening song of the Broadway edition of HAMILTON.\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
