The regional breakdown of these authorized refugee admissions is as follows: Africa – 15,500; East Asia – 17,000; Europe/Central Asia – 2,500; Latin America/Caribbean – 5,000; Near East/South Asia – 35,000; and Unallocated Reserve – 5,000. The Obama Administration is committed to maintaining a robust refugee admissions program – a longstanding and important component of America’s overall effort in support of vulnerable people around the world. The recent economic downturn has presented new challenges for this and other humanitarian programs. To address these challenges, the Administration has undertaken an in-depth review of the program with the goal of strengthening support to both the refugees and the communities in which they are being resettled.\n\n\n\n"
