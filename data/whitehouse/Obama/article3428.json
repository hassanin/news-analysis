Only through measurable progress towards those objectives will the private sector, small business owners, and international investors have the necessary confidence in the security of their investment and assurances that business dealings are fair and legal. The United States is also partnering with Central American and Caribbean countries to identify concrete steps to advance energy sector reform, regional integration, and clean energy development.\n\nBolstering Cooperation to Protect Vulnerable Migrants Consistent with U.S. Law\n\n\tThe Obama Administration is deepening cooperation between the United States and Central America to ensure that fewer migrants embark on the dangerous journey to the United States.  Those who do not qualify for refugee status will be returned consistent with U.S. law and values.  The numbers of unaccompanied children and family units apprehended at the United States’ southwest border have continued to increase through the fall and winter, a time when the numbers have historically decreased. Unaccompanied children and family unit apprehensions in November and December were significantly above the previous highest apprehension totals for these months, which occurred in 2014.\n\n\tAs the President and Vice President have made clear, recently arrived undocumented migrants who have been through the immigration court process, have been determined by a U.S. immigration judge to not qualify for asylum or other relief, and have received final orders of removal, are immigration enforcement priorities and should be removed. As part of the civil immigration enforcement priorities announced by Secretary Johnson in November 2014, the Department of Homeland Security is focused on removing individuals who, whether alone or with family members, have been apprehended while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States and individuals who have received a final order of removal on or after January 1, 2014. \n\n\tWhile securing our Southwest border and enforcing our immigration laws are top priorities for the U.S. government, the Administration understands that these actions alone will not address the underlying conditions that currently exist in Central America. Current push factors driving the recent migration spike include criminal violence, domestic and sexual violence, a debilitating drought, and a lack of economic opportunity. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America is intended to address many of underlying conditions driving migration.  The Administration is working diligently to establish additional avenues for safe, legal, and orderly migration. Broadening access to protection for refugees from the Northern Triangle must be a shared responsibility of the United States, Central American governments, and the other countries of the hemisphere and around the world.\n\n\tThe United States plans to expand access to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for vulnerable individuals and families from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  This will:\n\n\n\t\tExpanding access to resettlement for asylum seekers from the Northern Triangle.\n\n\t\tOffer a legal alternative to the dangerous and unlawful journey many are currently taking in the hands of human smugglers.\n\n\t\tEnable the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees and its nongovernmental partners in the region to identify persons in need of refugee protection\n\n\t\tBetter address the needs of those threatened by criminal gang violence and domestic violence, human rights defenders who have been targeted, and others.\n\n\nA Comprehensive Approach\n\n\tThe Obama Administration is dedicated to pursuing a comprehensive approach in Central America.  This includes partnering with the region to advance good governance, prosperity, and citizen security, enforcing our domestic immigration laws, and working to provide services and assistance to migrants or intending migrants who may be at imminent risk of harm.  The Obama administration believes that a safe, stable, and prosperous Central America is vital in order to achieve a future where the Western Hemisphere is middle class, democratic, and secure.  \n\n\n\n\n"
