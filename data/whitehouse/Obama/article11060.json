Therefore, I am continuing in effect for an additional year the national emergency that was declared on September 14, 2001, with respect to the terrorist threat.\nThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\n\n                                  BARACK OBAMA\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nSeptember 10, 2010.\n\n\n\n"
