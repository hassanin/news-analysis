Rather than encouraging companies to bring jobs back to our shores, they chose to play politics and block measures that will create jobs and strengthen the middle class. We will continue to push Congress to act on proposals like this one and the other remaining portions of the President's American Jobs Act that independent economists say would create a million new American Jobs. It's time for Republicans in Congress to stop obstructing these commonsense proposals and act to create good jobs here at home.\n\n\n\n\n"
