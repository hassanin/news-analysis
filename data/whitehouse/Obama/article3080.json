FOCUSED AREAS OF COORDINATION AND FUNDING IN NUCLEAR AND RADIOLOGICAL SECURITY\n\n\t(Note: Following areas of focus will be reviewed every 2-3 years for possible updates by the Global Partnership.)\n\nENHANCEMENT OF NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY REGIMES\n\n\t1.      Provide assistance to and coordinate programs and activities on the development of Nuclear Security Culture and Personnel Reliability Programs.\n\n\t2.      Provide assistance to and coordinate their programs and activities towards reducing insider threats.\n\n\t3.      Provide assistance to and coordinate programs and activities on strengthening measures of transportation security and the sharing of good practices and lessons learned among the relevant industries and Centers of Excellence (COEs) working on transportation of nuclear material, without detriment to the protection of sensitive information.\n\n\t4.      Provide assistance to and coordinate programs and activities on enhancing nuclear security, exploring the development of alternative technologies, and end-of-life management for radioactive sources – especially high activity ones.\n\n\t5.      Provide assistance to and coordinate programs and activities on enhancing computer security, supporting the use of the IAEA Implementing Guide on Security of Nuclear Information by States and conducting scientist engagement, which is one of the priority areas of the Global Partnership.\n\n\t6.      Provide assistance to and coordinate programs and activities on training centers / COEs and in doing so, work collaboratively with the IAEA International Network for Nuclear Security Training and Support Centres.\n\n\t7.      Provide assistance to and coordinate programs and activities that implement the actions of the Gift Basket on Nuclear Security Training and Support Centres / COEs.\n\n\t8.      Provide assistance to and coordinate programs and activities on support for equipment and maintenance of nuclear security systems, as well as the advice on the implementation of the IAEA’s guidance document INFCIRC/225/Rev. 5.\n\n\t9.      Provide assistance to and coordinate programs and activities on the development of awareness training and exercise efforts for countering nuclear smuggling focused on interior law enforcement and emergency management personnel.  Such assistance would also address sharing information and new technologies to enhance enforcement capacity of customs and border personnel, collaborating with INTERPOL.\n\nNUCLEAR FORENSICS\n\n\t10.   Provide assistance to and coordinate programs and activities on strengthening nuclear forensics capacities by ways of, inter alia, exchange of experts and support for upgrading capacities of nuclear forensics, collaborating with other international initiatives such as the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT).\n\nDISPOSITION AND CONVERSION OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS\n\n\t11.   Provide assistance to and coordinate programs and activities on the safe, secure and timely consolidation of nuclear materials inside countries, removal of such material to other countries for disposal, down-blending highly enriched uranium (HEU) to low-enriched uranium (LEU), converting plutonium to mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, reducing stockpiles of separated plutonium, and minimizing HEU, where technically and economically feasible.\n\nB. GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS AREAS\n\n\n\t\tConsider risks that may result in nuclear and other radioactive material, goods or devices falling into malicious hands, or where malicious actors may attack sensitive facilities or transports. \n\n\nC. GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP ENHANCEMENT\n\nSTRENGTHENING GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP MATCHMAKING\n\n\n\t\tAdvocate the organisation of at least one assistance matchmaking event a year.  Organisers are expected to align project proposals with Global Partnership priorities, share proposals in advance of meetings, and allot time in the Global Partnership Working Group (GPWG) meetings for presentation and discussion of the proposals.\n\n\t\tAdvocate for the Global Partnership to work with the UNSCR 1540 Group of Experts to develop a process for matching resources with UNSCR 1540 requests.\n\n\t\tAdvocate for the Global Partnership to work with the IAEA on matching Global Partnership donors with requesting states to respond to gaps or needs as identified through IAEA Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plan (INSSP) missions.\n\n\nSTRENGTHENING COOPERATION WITH THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL FORA\n\n\n\t\tAdvocate for the Global Partnership to cooperate with the UN, the IAEA, INTERPOL and, when suitable, other relevant organizations and initiatives such as the GICNT, in coordinating information sharing, lessons learned, good practices, guidance and resources, recognizing the central coordination role of the IAEA, including active participation of relevant Global Partnership representatives in IAEA-hosted Information Exchange Meetings in order that the activities of the Global Partnership support and complement the work of other international organizations and initiatives.\n\n\t\tAdvocate for the Global Partnership to strengthen its ties with other international organizations and initiatives that support nuclear and radiological security.  These fora, most of which are represented at Global Partnership meetings, include the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 Committee, the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA), and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR), the World Customs Organization (WCO), and the European Union (EU). \n\n\nEXPANDING MEMBERSHIP\n\n\n\t\tContinue to advocate for the Global Partnership to expand its membership, particularly from regions not well represented.\n\n\nRAISING THE PROFILE WITH GP LEADERS, INCLUDING G7 LEADERS\n\n7.     Seek opportunities to continue to engage GP leaders, including G7 leaders, on nuclear security.\n\nPROMOTING THE WORK OF THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP IN NUCLEAR SECURITY\n\n\n\t\tAdvocate for the Chair of the Global Partnership to widely distribute the Global Partnership Annual Report beyond Global Partnership members to include other States and relevant international organisations.\n\n\t\tAdvocate that, where applicable, all Global Partnership members include the report and other references to nuclear security achievements of the Global Partnership on their own websites and other relevant media.\n\n\nDEVELOPING A RAPID FUNDING RESPONSE CAPABILITY\n\n\n\t\tAdvocate for the Global Partnership members, whenever possible, to rapidly respond to unanticipated nuclear and radiological security situations by providing assistance to and coordinating their nuclear and radiological programs and activities to address those situations.\n\n\nENHANCING ACCOUNTING OF ASSISTANCE FUNDING FOR NUCLEAR SECURITY\n\n\n\t\tAdvocate for the Global Partnership to develop a more standardized process for accounting for the non-sensitive data submitted to the Chair of the Global Partnership for the annual Global Partnership Annex of financial and in-kind expenditures on nuclear and radiological security. \n\n\n\t###\n\n\n\n\n"
