The region is taking a cost-e\u001dffective, step-by-step approach towards achieving this vision, by focusing investments on projects that have immediate bene\u001efits, but which also lay the groundwork for the future.\nSummary of Corridor Investments\nImprovements will be made to the corridor using funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to provide rail passengers in the Pacific Northwest with faster, more reliable and more frequent service.\n\nSeattle - Portland: Two additional daily round trips will be added between Seattle and Portland, for a total of six; travel time will be reduced by at least 5 percent; and on-time performance will increase substantially, from 62 to 88 percent. Major construction projects include building bypass tracks to allow for increased train frequency and multiple upgrades to existing track and signal systems. Several safety-related projects will also be funded, including grade separations, positive train control, and seismic retrofits to Seattle’s historic King Street Station.\n\nPortland - Eugene: Investments include upgrading Portland’s Union Station, and engineering and environmental work for track and signaling projects that will increase service reliability and reduce congestion.\n\n\n\n"
