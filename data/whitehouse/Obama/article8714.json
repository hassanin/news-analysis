The President has been briefed on the independent review of Dover Port Mortuary and strongly supports the Pentagonâ€™s efforts to make needed systemic structural changes so that these types of incidents never happen again. The United States has a solemn obligation to compassionately and professionally care for fallen service members and their families, and those we tragically lost on 9/11.\n\n\n\n\n"
