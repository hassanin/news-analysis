and\n\n\t (iii)  within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, designate in writing to the Archivist of the United States (Archivist), a senior agency official to supervise the review required by subsection (b) of this section, in coordination with the agency's  Records Officer, Chief Information Officer, and General Counsel.\n\n\t(b)  Within 120 days of the date of this memorandum, each agency head shall submit a report to the Archivist and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that:\n\n\t (i)    describes the agency's current plans for improving or maintaining its records management program, particularly with respect to managing electronic records, including email and social media, deploying cloud based services or storage solutions, and meeting other records challenges;\n\n\t (ii)   identifies any provisions, or omissions, in relevant statutes, regulations, or official NARA guidance that currently pose an obstacle to the agency's adoption of sound, cost effective records management policies and practices; and\n\n\t (iii)  identifies policies or programs that, if included in the Records Management Directive required by section 3 of this memorandum or adopted or implemented by NARA, would assist the agency's efforts to improve records management.\n\n\tThe reports submitted pursuant to this subsection should supplement, and therefore need not duplicate, information provided by agencies to NARA pursuant to other reporting obligations.\n\nSec. 3.  Records Management Directive.  (a)  Within 120 days of the deadline for reports submitted pursuant to section 2(b) of this memorandum, the Director of OMB and the Archivist, in coordination with the Associate Attorney General, shall issue a Records Management Directive that directs agency heads to take specific steps to reform and improve records management policies and practices within their agency.  The directive shall focus on:\n\n\t (i)    creating a Government wide records management framework that is more efficient and cost effective;\n\n\t (ii)   promoting records management policies and practices that enhance the capability of agencies to fulfill their statutory missions;\n\n\t (iii)  maintaining accountability through documentation of agency actions;\n\n\t (iv)   increasing open Government and appropriate public access to Government records;\n\n\t (v)    supporting agency compliance with applicable legal requirements related to the preservation of information relevant to litigation; and\n\n\t (vi)   transitioning from paper-based records management to electronic records management where feasible.\n\n\t(b)  In the course of developing the directive, the Archivist, in coordination with the Director of OMB and the Associate Attorney General, shall review relevant statutes, regulations, and official NARA guidance to identify opportunities for reforms that would facilitate improved Government wide records management practices, particularly with respect to electronic records.  The Archivist, in coordination with the Director of OMB and the Associate Attorney General, shall present to the President the results of this review, no later than the date of the directive's issuance, to facilitate potential updates to the laws, regulations, and policies governing the management of Federal records.\n\n\t(c)  In developing the directive, the Director of OMB and the Archivist, in coordination with the Associate Attorney General, shall consult with other affected agencies, interagency groups, and public stakeholders.\n\nSec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n\t (b)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n\t (i)   authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n\t (ii)  functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n\t(c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nSec. 5.  Publication.  The Archivist is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
