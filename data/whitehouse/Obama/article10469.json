She is a principled leader and a consensus-builder. She has spent her time in office working her heart out to improve the lives of the people she represents. And she loves her husband and family above all else. On this tragic day, Jill and I are praying for Gabby’s recovery, and we hold her family in our hearts.\n\n\tChief Judge John Roll was a dedicated jurist whose death is a terrible loss to Arizona and to the country.\n\n\tWe do not yet know the motivation behind these shootings. But what we do know is that there is simply no justification, no rationale for such senseless and appalling violence in our society.\n\n\tPlease join Jill and me in praying for each of today’s victims and for their families and loved ones.\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
