The President noted that he has increased VA’s budget since he came into office and that he would continue to make VA funding a top priority.  On the issue of the disability claims backlog, the President noted the VA has made great progress, cutting the backlog by more than 40 percent in the last year, but that there is more work to be done.  The President has previously announced that he remains committed to eliminating the disability claims backlog in 2015.  Leaders from VFW also asked the President to convey their thanks to First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden for their work through their Joining Forces initiative to support and engage veterans and military families.\n\n\n\n\n"
