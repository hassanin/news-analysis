Hogan\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAfter fifteen years of litigation, today’s decision marks another important step forward in the relationship between the federal government and Indian Country.  Resolving this dispute was a priority for my Administration, and we will engage in government-to-government consultations with tribal nations regarding the land consolidation component of the settlement to ensure that this moves ahead at an appropriate pace and in an appropriate manner.  And going forward, my Administration will continue to strengthen our relationship with Indian Country.\n\n\n\n\n"
