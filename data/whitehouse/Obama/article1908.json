A monthly status report on actions underway should be submitted to me through Mr. Brennan.

As we go forward, it is imperative that we work together to correct problems highlighted by this incident, focusing on concrete solutions. We are all responsible for the safety and security of the American people and must redouble our efforts to be effective in carrying out this solemn responsibility.\n\n\n\n"
