The existing Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, done at Strasbourg on January 25, 1988, entered into force for the United States on January 4, 1995 (the \"existing Convention\"). I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State, which includes an Overview of the proposed Protocol.\n\n\tThe proposed Protocol amends the existing Convention in order to bring it into conformity with current international standards on exchange of information, as reflected in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital and the current U.S. Model Income Tax Convention. Furthermore, it updates the existing Convention's rules regarding the confidentiality and permitted uses of exchanged tax information, and opens the existing Convention to adherence by countries other than OECD and Council of Europe members. The Protocol entered into force on January 6, 2011, following ratification by five parties to the existing Convention.\n\n\tI recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the proposed Protocol and give its advice and consent to its ratification.\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
