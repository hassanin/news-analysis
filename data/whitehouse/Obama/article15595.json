They started by talking about how even with the recent bombings, security incidents, which is a measure of activity on the ground, is at its lowest since the war began. The President and General Odierno talked about whether the troops had everything that they needed, including mental health support. I should start by reiterating that at the top of the meeting, the President said the same thing he said to you guys, which was, he underscored that even as the recent focus has been on getting the strategy right in Afghanistan and Pakistan, we still have lots of work to do here in Iraq.\n\n\t\tThey discussed diplomatic and political efforts that have to continue in order to see progress, and what challenges lie ahead; the need to continue to build strong Iraqi institutions; the importance of upcoming elections.\n\n\t\tLet me see, in terms of some of the diplomatic and politics efforts, they talked about the integration of Sunnis into the security forces, the balance between federal and national institutions, and the hydro --\n\n\t\tQ Into the security forces, you said?\n\n\t\tMR.
