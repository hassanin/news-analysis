The President believes this is a positive development towards reaching a strong, unified and bipartisan agreement in the U.S. Senate.\nOver the last 11 months, the Obama Administration has made historic strides in building a clean energy economy, creating new American jobs and reducing US dependence on foreign oil. From robust domestic actions including historic investments in clean energy to sustained international engagement to encourage countries around the world to reduce their carbon emissions, the President has established a new energy foundation.  The passage of comprehensive energy legislation is essential to that effort.\nIn a demonstration of the growing consensus surrounding the need to reform our energy economy,  the President heard from CEOs yesterday who told him that passing clean energy legislation and supporting an international accord to reduce emissions will strengthen our economy and enhance our competitiveness.\nThe President looks forward to working with the Senate and signing comprehensive energy and climate legislation as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n"
