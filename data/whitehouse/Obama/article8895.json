To date, the U.S. has provided approximately $870 million for relief purposes.  Importantly, and even as we help to meet the emergency needs of the people of this region, we are also investing in their long-term food security http://www.feedthefuture.gov/.\n\n\tFor more information, please visit the FWD Campaign run by the U.S. Agency for International Development, and to learn more about how you can get involved, please visit http://action.usaid.gov/ .\n\n\n\n\n"
