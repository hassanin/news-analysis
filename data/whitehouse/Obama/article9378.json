Congress must rally around bold new ideas that encourage businesses to hire Americans who are ready to work, and ideas that unlock the full potential of American innovation, entrepreneurship and hard work.\n\n\t“I’ve traveled throughout New York State this summer, hearing from small business owners and everyday families. I can tell you, they want Democrats and Republicans to work together to once and for all address this crisis, and create new jobs. They are tired of the same old political fights, and with good reason. Old fights won’t solve new problems. Americans deserve better from Congress.\n\n\t“If we’re going to create new jobs and a thriving middle class that is prepared for the new economy, we can’t think small. We need big ideas met with good faith and common purpose from both parties in Congress.” \n\n\n\n\n"
