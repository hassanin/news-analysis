These elections mark a vital step in the peace process that began in 2006.\nElections like these are a milestone not just for Nepal but for people around the world working to rebuild after conflicts and resolve disputes via constitutional and homegrown means.  The Nepali people endured years of civil war, in which innocent civilians were the victims of violent extremism and terrorism.  Since the end of the conflict, Nepal has made vital progress toward supporting civil society, promoting the participation of women and youth, and becoming a pluralistic democracy that can support the dreams and aspirations of all the Nepali people.  As Nepal’s newly elected leaders turn to the important task of concluding a constitution, the United States will continue to support Nepal’s progress along a peaceful, prosperous, inclusive, and democratic path.\n \n\n\n\n\n"
