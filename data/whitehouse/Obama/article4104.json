The leaders affirmed that the JCPOA represents an historic solution that will verifiably prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon by cutting off all of the potential pathways to a bomb while ensuring the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program going forward. The leaders committed to remain in close coordination as the JCPOA is operationalized. The President also welcomed Monday's agreement between Greece and its creditors. The President noted that the agreement is a positive step that could help to underpin a return to growth and debt sustainability in Greece, but that further work will be required.\n\n\n\n\n"
