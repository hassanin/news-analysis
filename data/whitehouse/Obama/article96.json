In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13712 of November 22, 2015, with respect to the situation in Burundi, is to continue in effect beyond November 22, 2016.\n\n\tThe situation in Burundi, which has been marked by the killing of and violence against civilians, unrest, the incitement of violence, and significant political repression, and which threatens the peace, security, and stability of Burundi, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13712 with respect to the situation in Burundi.\n\n\tSincerely,\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
