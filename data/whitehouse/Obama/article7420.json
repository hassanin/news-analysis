Fixing our immigration system is one of my top legislative priorities and I am hopeful that we can make  immigration reform a reality this year.\nCinco de Mayo reminds us that America’s diversity is America’s strength. Today, as we celebrate the contributions and history of Mexican Americans and Hispanics in America, let us celebrate the larger story of America and our unique immigrant heritage.\n \n\n\n\n\n"
