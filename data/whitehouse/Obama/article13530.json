As part of that commitment, we have been working with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) which has been charged with conducting detailed oversight of spending of Recovery Act funds at the state level.   \"Last week I met with GAO Acting Comptroller General Gene Dodaro to receive an update on their oversight efforts and this week my staff met with the staff of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to discuss our joint commitment to subject all Recovery Act spending to unprecedented scrutiny.  Together, we will work to ensure that every dollar of taxpayer funds under the Recovery Act is moving without delay to the most effective projects and meeting the most urgent needs.     \"I was pleased to hear in today’s testimony by the Acting Comptroller General that as construction crews begin to lay new roads and green manufacturers increase staffing to meet new demand, states have begun to establish oversight measures in keeping with our high standards for how Recovery Act funds are spent.  Chairman Lieberman, Senator Collins and I are committed to working with states to continue to refine the reporting and oversight process and look forward to working together to ensure that Recovery Act funds move promptly toward the programs and projects that will drive our economic recovery.\"\n\n\n\n"
