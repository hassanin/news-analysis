Those are the goals of the Food Safety Working Group I convened in March and charged with making recommendations to improve our food safety system.  And that is why we announced a new rule to control Salmonella contamination in eggs and are working to reduce the presence of harmful pathogens such as E. coli in meat and produce; strengthen our capacity to trace the source of outbreaks; and update our emergency operations procedures.  I commend the House of Representatives for its action today and look forward to working with the Senate to enact critical food safety legislation.\"   \n\n\n\n"
