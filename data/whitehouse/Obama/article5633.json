The two leaders expressed their appreciation for the strong bilateral ties and alliance between Greece and the United States. On Ukraine, the leaders agreed that Russia’s continued provision of heavy weapons and equipment to the separatists in eastern Ukraine required a firm and unified response from the European Union and the United States. With regards to Cyprus, the Vice President informed Prime Minister Samaras about his recent trip to the island in May, and the leaders discussed their strong support for a comprehensive settlement to the conflict that would reunify Cyprus as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with political equality.\n\n\n\n\n"
