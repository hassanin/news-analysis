The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is rooted in our shared values and mutual commitment to global peace, prosperity, and security. Since the beginning of the counter-ISIL campaign the United Kingdom has been one of our most valued partners in fighting ISIL. We look forward to having British forces flying with the Coalition over Syria, and will work to integrate them into our Coalition Air Tasking Orders as quickly as possible.\n\nI also welcome yesterday’s announcement from the German Cabinet that Germany will commit up to 1,200 German troops to support Coalition efforts to fight ISIL, including potentially deploying reconnaissance planes, tanker aircraft, and support for the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in the Gulf. While this still requires German Parliamentary approval, this is a clear sign of Germany’s continued commitment to the counter-ISIL campaign and to working with a broad range of partners to defeat this shared threat.\n\nISIL is a global threat that must be defeated by a global response. The United States welcomes any partner’s genuine counter-ISIL efforts in Syria and Iraq, and I applaud the steps taken by the UK and Germany that demonstrate our unity and resolve.  I look forward to working closely with the UK, Germany, and all our Coalition partners on our ongoing shared efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL.\n\n\n\n\n"
