He has helped pass some of the most important laws of the last half-century, from Medicare to the Civil Rights Act to the Clean Air Act to the Affordable Care Act, and he continues to fight for workers’ rights, access to affordable healthcare, and the preservation of our environment for future generations to enjoy.  Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to John and his family, and I look forward to congratulating him in person at the White House next week.\n\n\n\n\n"
