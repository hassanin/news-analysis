On behalf of the American people, the President expressed his condolences to General Allen and to the families who lost loved ones. The President thanked General Allen for all of the measures he is taking to protect our servicemembers and civilians in Afghanistan and to encourage calm. We welcome President Karzai's statement this morning encouraging peaceful expressions, and his call for dialogue and calm.
