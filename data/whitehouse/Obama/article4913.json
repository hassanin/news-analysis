I saw then that she had a first-rate mind and keen insight into the biggest national security challenges we face. Avril has served with distinction under Democrats and Republicans, at the State Department, in Congress, at the White House, and most recently at the Central Intelligence Agency. At every turn, she has taken on the most sensitive and difficult assignments and responded with uncommon wisdom and capability. Avril has earned the trust and affection of her colleagues by treating people with respect and delivering results. I am proud of Avril and pleased that she will be returning to the White House as Deputy National Security Advisor.  \nI also congratulate Tony Blinken on his confirmation as Deputy Secretary of State. I look forward to continuing our close and longstanding partnership.\n\n\n\n\n"
