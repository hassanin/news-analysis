Both sides must exert the greatest restraint in this situation.\nIt is critical that the two countries proceed with plans for meetings of the Joint Political Security Mechanism and the Abyei Joint Operations Committee in late March and the presidential summit on April 3. Only through direct contact and negotiations over fundamental issues of security and border management in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Abyei can Sudan and South Sudan avoid further fighting, achieve vitally needed economic cooperation, and coexist in peace. We also urge Darfur armed movements and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement–North to exercise restraint and cooperate fully with restoration of peace.\nAchieving humanitarian access and protection of the civilian population must be the priority of all those concerned for the people of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile.\n\n\n\n\n"
