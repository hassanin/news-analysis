We offer our full support to our Israeli partners as they work to determine who was behind the attack. Such cowardly acts can never be justified, and we call on all to send a clear and unequivocal message that terrorism must never be tolerated. We extend our deepest condolences to the families of the victims and our hopes for quick and full recovery for those who were wounded.\n\n\n\n\n"
