I had the honor and privilege of knowing President Kaczynski - recently having been with him in Poland as we worked out the new missile defense agreement.\n\tHis loss and the loss of Mrs. Kaczynski along with so many dedicated servants of the Polish people is almost too much to ask the Polish people to endure - but endure you will as you always have.\n\tPlease know that I am an admirer of all that is Polish - and that you can count on my country and all Americans to continue to stand with you.\n\tWith deep sympathy.\n\tJoe Biden\"\nTo view a photograph of the Vice President signing the condolence book at the Polish Embassy, please click HERE.\n\n\n\n\n"
