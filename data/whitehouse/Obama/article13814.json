Almost two years after the crisis hit and almost one year after the Administration first laid out a detailed plan for holding Wall Street accountable and protecting consumers, he will call for swift Senate action. The crisis has already wiped out trillions of dollars in family wealth and cost over 8 million jobs. The President will also remindÂ  Americans what is at stake if we do not move forward with changing the rules of the road as a part of a strong Wall Street reform package.\nMore details will be announced when they become available.\n\n\n\n"
