As the GAO notes, the Recovery Act has played a critical role in providing health care assistance for the hardest-hit among us, kept hundreds of thousands of teachers in America’s classrooms during tough economic times and, from infrastructure to innovation, is supporting job-creating projects in every corner of the country.   \n\t \n\t“As we work to reverse a decade’s worth of failed economic policies and rebuild our economy on a new foundation that strengthens the middle class, we continue to deliver on Recovery Act programs on-time and, in many cases, under-budget.  We are constantly looking for ways to improve Recovery Act implementation and appreciate some of the new recommendations the GAO has made today.  As we have with previous reports, we have asked agencies to look at how they can act on the new guidance to strengthen management of Recovery Act programs even further.”\n\n\n\n\n"
