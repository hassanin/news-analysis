He was a truly unique figure who will be remembered for his tireless diplomacy, love of country, and pursuit of peace.\n\n\tFor nearly 50 years, Richard served the country he loved with honor and distinction.  He worked as a young foreign service officer during the Vietnam War and then supported the Paris peace talks which ended that war.  As a young Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, he helped normalize relations with China.  As U.S. Ambassador to Germany, he helped Europe emerge from a long Cold War and encouraged NATO to welcome new members. \n\n\tAs Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, he was the tireless chief architect of the Dayton Accords that ended the war in Bosnia 15 years ago this week, saving countless lives.  As Ambassador to the United Nations, Richard helped break a political impasse and strengthen our nation’s relationship with the UN and elevated the cause of AIDS and Africa on the international agenda.  And throughout his life, as a child of refugees, he devoted himself to the plight of people displaced around the world.  \n\n\tWhen I became President, I was grateful that Richard agreed to serve as Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.  The progress that we have made in Afghanistan and Pakistan is due in no small measure to Richard’s relentless focus on America’s national interest, and pursuit of peace and security. He understood, in his life and his work, that our interests encompassed the values that we hold so dear. And as usual, amidst his extraordinary duties, he also mentored young people who will serve our country for decades to come.  One of his friends and admirers once said that, “If you’re not on the team and you’re in his way, God help you.”  Like so many Presidents before me, I am grateful that Richard Holbrooke was on my team, as are the American people.\n\n\tEarlier this evening at the State Department, I met with Richard’s wife Kati and their family, David, Anthony, Lizzie, Christopher and Sarah, and I spoke to Kati after Richard’s passing. I expressed to them the gratitude of the American people for his lifetime of service.  They are in our thoughts and prayers tonight.  Tonight, there are millions of people around the world whose lives have been saved and enriched by his work.  As I said earlier this evening, the United States is safer and the world is more secure because of the half century of patriotic service of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.    \n\n\n\n\n"
