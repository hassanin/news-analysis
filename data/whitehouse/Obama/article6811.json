It is unfortunate that the common sense, clean debt limit increase proposed by Senate Democrats was refused a yes or no vote today. This bill would have taken the threat of default off the table, and given our nation's businesses and the economy the certainty we need. With five days until the government runs out of borrowing authority, Congress needs to move forward with a solution that reopens the government and allows us to pay our bills so we can move on to the business of achieving a broader budget deal that creates jobs, grows the economy and strengthens the middle class.\n\n\n\n\n"
