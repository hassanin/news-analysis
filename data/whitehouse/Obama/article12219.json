The awards will help make health IT available to over 100,000 hospitals and primary care physicians by 2014 and train thousands of people for careers in health care and information technology. This Recovery Act investment will help grow the emerging health IT industry which is expected to support tens of thousands of jobs ranging from nurses and pharmacy techs to IT technicians and trainers.\nThe over $750 million in HHS grant awards Secretary Sebelius announced today are part of a federal initiative to build capacity to enable widespread meaningful use of health IT. This assistance at the state and regional level will facilitate health care providers' efforts to adopt and use electronic health records (EHRs) in a meaningful manner that has the potential to improve the quality and efficiency of health care for all Americans. Of the over $750 million investment, $386 million will go to 40 states and qualified State Designated Entities (SDEs) to facilitate health information exchange (HIE) at the state level, while $375 million will go to an initial 32 non-profit organizations to support the development of regional extension centers (RECs) that will aid health professionals as they work to implement and use health information technology - with additional HIE and REC awards to be announced in the near future. RECs are expected to provide outreach and support services to at least 100,000 primary care providers and hospitals within two years.\n\"Health information technology can make our health care system more efficient and improve the quality of care we all receive,\" said Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. \"These grant awards, the first of their kind, will help develop our electronic infrastructure and give doctors and other health care providers the support they need as they adopt this powerful technology.\"\nThe more than $225 million in DOL grant awards Secretary Solis announced will be used to train 15,000 people in job skills needed to access careers in health care, IT and other high growth fields. Through existing partnerships with local employers, the recipients of these grants have already identified roughly 10,000 job openings for skilled workers that likely will become available in the next two years in areas like nursing, pharmacy technology and information technology. The grants will fund 55 separate training programs in 30 states to help train people for secure, well-paid health jobs and meet the growing employment demand for health workers. Employment services will be available via the Department of Labor's local One Stop Career Centers, and training will be offered at community colleges and other local education providers.\n“The Recovery Act’s investments are making a positive difference in the lives of America’s working families,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. “The investments announced today will ensure thousands of workers across the nation can receive high-quality training and employment services, which will lead to good jobs in healthcare and other industries offering career-track employment and good pay and benefits.”\nThe HHS and DOL awards are part of an overall $100 billion investment in science, innovation and technology the Administration is making through the Recovery Act to spur domestic job creation in growing industries and lay a long-term foundation for economic growth. In addition to the 10,000 jobs the DOL grantees expect to fill with freshly trained workers, the health IT extension centers are expected to hire over 3,000 technology workers nationwide in the months ahead. Overall, the Administration investments in health IT and training will help significantly expand an emerging industry expected to support tens of thousands of secure, well-paid jobs nationwide.\nA complete listing of the state HIE, REC and job training grant recipients is as follows: State HIE Awards:\n\n\n\nState HIE Awardee\nAward Amount\n\n\nAlabama Medicaid Agency\n$ 10,564,789\n\n\nArizona Governor's Office of Economic Recovery\n$ 9,377,000\n\n\nArkansas Dept of Finance and Administration\n$ 7,909,401\n\n\nCalifornia Health and Human Services Agency\n$ 38,752,536\n\n\nColorado Regional Health Information Organization\n$ 9,175,777\n\n\nDelaware Health Information Network\n$ 4,680,284\n\n\nGovernment of the District of Columbia\n$ 5,189,709\n\n\nGeorgia Department of Community Health\n$ 13,003,003\n\n\nOffice of the Governor (Guam)\n$ 1,600,000\n\n\nThe Hawaii Health Information Exchange\n$ 5,602,318\n\n\nIllinois Department of Health care and Family Services\n$ 18,837,639\n\n\nKansas Health Information Exchange Project\n$ 9,010,066\n\n\nCabinet for Health and Family Services (Kentucky)\n$ 9,750,000\n\n\nState of Maine/Governor's Office of Health Policy & Finance\n$ 6,599,401\n\n\nMassachusetts Technology Park Corporation\n$ 10,599,719\n\n\nMichigan Department of Health\n$ 14,993,085\n\n\nMinnesota Department of Health\n$ 9,622,000\n\n\nMissouri Depart of Social Services\n$ 13,765,040\n\n\nNevada Department of Health and Human Services\n$ 6,133,426\n\n\nNew Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services\n$ 5,457,856\n\n\nLovelace Clinic Foundation, New Mexico\n$ 7,070,441\n\n\nNew York eHealth Collaborative Inc.\n$ 22,364,782\n\n\nCommonwealth of the NMI, Department of Public Health\n$ 800,000\n\n\nNorth Carolina Department of State Treasurer\n$ 12,950,860\n\n\nOhio Health Information Partnership LLC\n$ 14,872,199\n\n\nOklahoma Health Care Authority\n$ 8,883,741\n\n\nPacific Ecommerce Development Corporation (American Samoa)\n$ 600,000\n\n\nState of Oregon\n$ 8,579,992\n\n\nGovernor's Office of Health Care Reform Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\n$ 17,140,446\n\n\nOticina del Gobernador La Fortaeza (Puerto Rico)\n$ 7,770,980\n\n\nRhode Island Quality Institute\n$ 5,280,000\n\n\nState of Tennessee\n$ 11,664,580\n\n\nUtah Department of Health\n$ 6,296,705\n\n\nVermont Department of Human Services\n$ 5,034,328\n\n\nVirgin Islands Department of Health\n$ 1,000,000\n\n\nVirginia Department of Health\n$ 11,613,537\n\n\nHealth Care Authority (Washington)\n$ 11,300,000\n\n\nWest Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources\n$ 7,819,000\n\n\nWisconsin Department of Health and Family Services\n$ 9,441,000\n\n\nOffice of the Governor (Wyoming)\n$ 4,873,000\n\n\nTotal Award Amount\n$ 385,978,640\n\n\n\nRegional Extension Center Awards:\n\n\n\nRECs Awardee\nAward Amount\n\n\nAltarum Institute, Michigan\n$ 19,619,990\n\n\nArkansas Foundation For Medical Care\n$ 7,400,000\n\n\nCIMRO of Nebraska\n$ 6,647,371\n\n\nColorado RHIO\n$ 12,475,000\n\n\nDistrict of Columbia Primary Care Association\n$ 5,488,437\n\n\nFund for Public Health New York\n$ 21,754,010\n\n\nGreater Cincinnati HealthBridge (Ohio-Kentucky)\n$ 9,738,000\n\n\nHealth Choice Network, Inc.,Florida\n$ 8,500,000\n\n\nHealthInsight, Utah-Nevada\n$ 6,917,783\n\n\nIowa IFMC\n$ 5,508,019\n\n\nKansas Foundation for Medical Care Inc.\n$ 7,000,000\n\n\nKey Health Alliance (Stratis Health), Minnesota – North Dakota\n$ 19,000,000\n\n\nLovelace Clinic, New Mexico\n$ 6,175,000\n\n\nMassachusetts Technology Park Cooperation\n$ 13,433,107\n\n\nMetaStar, Inc, Wisconsin\n$ 9,125,000\n\n\nMorehouse School of Medicine, Inc., Georgia\n$ 19,521,542\n\n\nNew York eHealth Collaborative (NYeC)\n$ 26,534,999\n\n\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill\n$ 13,569,169\n\n\nNorthern California Regional Extension Center\n$ 17,286,081\n\n\nNorthern Illinois University\n$ 7,546,000\n\n\nNorthwestern University\n$ 7,649,533\n\n\nOCHIN Inc.
