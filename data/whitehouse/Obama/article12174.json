The Administration is setting up an innovation fund to work with housing finance agencies in the hardest-hit areas, so that those states and localities can further respond to the most pressing problems in their communities.\nHelp for the Hardest-Hit Housing Markets\n1. $1.5 Billion to Work with State Housing Agencies to Innovate and Help Address the Problems Facing the Hardest-Hit Housing Markets\n\nThere will be a formula for allocating funding among eligible states that will be based on home price declines and unemployment.\nHFAs must submit a program design to Treasury.\nPrograms may include:\n    \nMeasures for unemployed homeowners;\nPrograms to assist  borrowers owing more than their home is now worth;\nPrograms that help address challenges arising from second mortgages; or\nOther programs encouraging sustainable and affordable homeownership.\n\n\n\n2. Accountability and Transparency for these Housing Programs\n\nAll funded program designs posted online.\nAccountability for results – program effectiveness measured and results published online.\nEffective oversight under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.\n\n \nHelp for the Hardest Hit Housing Markets\nPresident Obama today is announcing Help for the Hardest Hit Housing Markets.  The program will apply to states that have suffered an average home price drop of over 20% from the peak.  State and local Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) in each state are already familiar with the urgent challenges facing their communities and have demonstrated the ability to address these challenges.  For that reason, we will work with these HFAs to expand the capacity to help address these challenges, with $1.5 billion from the funds set aside for housing under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA).\nThe HFAs will determine the priorities facing their local markets.  The program will be under strict transparency and accountability rules.  The increase in HFA activities in these areas will support families in these markets, combining with the numerous other steps the Administration has taken to address housing markets.\nFunds can be used for innovation to take steps to address difficult, locally-important challenges for the hardest-hit housing markets, including unemployed borrowers, underwater borrowers, and second liens.\nPrograms must meet funding requirements under EESA.  These include that the recipient of funds must be an eligible financial institution and that the funds must be used to pay for mortgage modifications or for other permitted uses under EESA.  Treasury will announce maximum state level allocations in the next two weeks, along with rules governing the submission of program designs by HFAs, and provide a period thereafter for HFAs to submit their program designs in order to receive funding. \n\nIllustrations of the Sorts of Programs that May be Funded in the States\nHousing markets vary considerably from state to state, and often within a single state.  Housing Finance Agencies are intimately engaged already in their local housing markets, and will play the lead role in determining what sorts of programs are most appropriate to local conditions.  Three sorts of problems that may be addressed with funding are unemployed borrowers, underwater borrowers, and second liens:\n1. Unemployed borrowers.  Since the recession began in 2008, unemployment has hit many families who own homes.  In previous times, when house prices were rising, families with unemployment could often sell their homes for more than they had paid, using the proceeds to tide them over. \nToday, by contrast, families in states where prices have dropped more than 20% often find themselves owing more than the house is worth in the current market.  Such homes are often difficult to sell, and families with unemployment often can’t pay the current mortgage and may not have enough income to qualify for a modification.\nIn such circumstances, one use of funds would be for HFAs to begin programs to help unemployed homeowners until they have secured a new job.  HFAs can consider a variety of programs to help unemployed borrowers.\n2. Underwater borrowers.  For states with more than 20% home price declines, a large portion of homeowners are “underwater” -- they owe more than the house is worth in the current market.  Such borrowers often find it difficult to sell their homes -- lenders may not agree to a sale that fails to pay back a mortgage in full.  HFAs may experiment with programs that would assist borrowers to negotiate with lenders to write down mortgages.\n3. Second liens.  An important challenge can arise for some borrowers who have a home equity line of credit or other second mortgage on their home. Often, a first mortgage lender who may be willing to modify the loan by reducing principal can run into difficulties in coordinating between the first and second mortgage lender. To smooth this coordination problem, and help assure that homeowners get an overall modification that works best, funds can be used to pay incentives to the second mortgage holders, addressing this potential obstacle to reducing principal and keeping borrowers in their homes.\n \n** This fact sheet has been updated.\n\n\n\n"
