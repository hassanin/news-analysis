The Vice President noted the United States would continue to engage with our European and other partners to provide Ukraine with the financing it needs to stabilize its economy as it pursues urgently needed reforms and anti-corruption measures. The two leaders also discussed Ukraine’s near- and long-term energy security, and the Vice President pledged continued U.S. technical support. The Vice President and President Poroshenko discussed the fact that Russia and its proxies continue to block delivery of humanitarian aid from entering the conflict-affected regions of eastern Ukraine, and that Russia’s actions in Ukraine have created a lawless environment where separatists are robbing pensioners and other citizens of their social benefits payments. The Vice President welcomed the Ukrainian government’s plan to keep in escrow these social benefits payments until such time as safe and direct disbursement was possible.\n\n\n\n\n"
