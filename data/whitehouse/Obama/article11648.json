I was proud to play a role in his return to the Democratic Party; his votes to pass the Recovery Act and health insurance reform were courageous and critical to our success.  I look forward to working with him during the rest of this year, and remaining in close contact with him after his term in Washington is finished.\n“I spoke to Joe Sestak last night and congratulated him on his impressive victory.   He will make a great candidate in the fall, and a wonderful United States Senator.  I look forward to campaigning for him in Pennsylvania and celebrating his victory in November.”\n\n\n\n"
