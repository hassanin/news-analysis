The nation’s uninsured rate now stands at its lowest level ever. But still, in communities across the country, 10.5 million people eligible for Marketplace coverage remain uninsured.\n\n\tToday, we are launching the White House “Healthy Communities Challenge” to engage key communities with large numbers or high percentages of uninsured in states across the country where strong federal, state and community collaboration can have a meaningful impact on reaching the uninsured. Through this challenge, we are calling on community leadership to build outreach efforts to reach these remaining uninsured and help them gain coverage.\n\n\tAt the end of this third open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), along with State-based Marketplaces, will publish tallies of new Marketplace signups in participating communities. These tallies will be compared to HHS estimates of the number of eligible uninsured people at the start of open enrollment to see which communities made the most progress during the challenge.\n\n\tThe victorious community gets bragging rights, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success in helping ensure every American has health coverage.\n\n\tBased on particularly high opportunity for impact, the White House reached out to local officials in each of these 20 communities, including Mayor Megan Barry, who embraced the “Healthy Communities Challenge” to get their uninsured constituents covered.\n\nNashville Health Insurance Marketplace for 2016\n\n\nHealth insurance coverage is affordable.  On June 30, 2015, 177,453 people in Tennessee were covered through its Health Insurance Exchange, or Marketplace.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Tennessee, 77 percent of people can find a plan for $100 or less, 71 percent for $75 or less, and 64 percent for $50 or less for 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\tFor the second-lowest silver plan, in Tennessee, a family of four with a household income of $60,000 is eligible for $448 in tax credits per month on average statewide, and a 27-year old with a household income of $25,000 is eligible for $93 in tax credits per month in 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\tTax credits matter. In 2015, 85 percent of Marketplace enrollees – 149,920 people – in Tennessee received a tax credit, and consumers saved an average of $221 per month.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumers have a choice. \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Tennessee, 4 issuers are offering individual health plans in the Marketplace in 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\tIssuers are offering an average of 57 plans per county in Tennessee in 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Nashville, 4 issuers are offering individual health plans in the Marketplace in 2016.\n\n\n \n\t\nIt pays to shop. \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Tennessee, 87 percent of Marketplace consumers who switch to the lowest-cost plan within a coverage level could save on average $60 per month, or $726 per year, on their premium costs in 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\tAbout 28 percent of 2014 enrollees in Tennessee switched to a new plan in 2015, saving $179 per year – and $2,976,431 in total statewide – on premium costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile progress has been made, more work is needed to cover the uninsured. \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Tennessee, the adult uninsured rate dropped from 16.8 percent in 2013 to 12.9 percent in the first half of 2015.\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Nashville and the surrounding region, there are 104,000 uninsured who are eligible for the Marketplace. (The number of the uninsured is for the Designated Market Area that includes Nashville.)\n\n\n\n\nCommunities Participating in the “Healthy Communities Challenge”\n\n\n\t\t         Dallas, TX\n\n\t\t         Tampa, FL\n\n\t\t         Atlanta, GA\n\n\t\t         Seattle, WA\n\n\t\t         Great Falls, MT\n\n\t\t         Salt Lake City, UT\n\n\t\t         Kansas City, MO\n\n\t\t         Chicago, IL\n\n\t\t         Phoenix, AZ\n\n\t\t         Detroit, MI\n\n\t\t         Charlotte, NC\n\n\t\t         Nashville, TN\n\n\t\t         New Orleans, LA\n\n\t\t         Denver, CO\n\n\t\t         Milwaukee, WI\n\n\t\t         Philadelphia, PA\n\n\t\t         Las Vegas, NV\n\n\t\t         Oakland, CA\n\n\t\t         Richmond, VA\n\n\t\t         Long Beach, CA\n\n\n\t# # #\n\n\n\n\n"
