Richard Holbrooke was a larger than life figure, who through his brilliance, determination and sheer force of will helped bend the curve of history in the direction of progress. He touched so many lives and helped save countless more.  He was a tireless negotiator, a relentless advocate for American interests, and the most talented diplomat we’ve had in a generation.  Jill and I will miss him tremendously and we extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Kati and the entire Holbrooke family during their time of grief.\n\n\n\n\n"
