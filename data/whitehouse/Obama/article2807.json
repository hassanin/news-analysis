As was clear from his 46 years in public service, George was a true patriot who dedicated his life to serving the people of Ohio. His dedication is underscored by the fact that he holds the record for being elected to more public offices than any other Ohioan in history. George leaves behind a powerful legacy of service to his state and country that will not soon be forgotten. Michelle and I offer his wife, Janet, and their children and grandchildren our condolences during this difficult time.\n\n\n\n\n"
