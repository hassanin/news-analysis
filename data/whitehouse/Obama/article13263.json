Today, on the \"Day of Portugal, Camões, and the Portuguese Communities,\"people of Portuguese descent around the world mark the date of the passing of Portugal’s greatest poet, Luís Vaz de Camões. It is fitting that Camões, who lived from 1524 to 1580, is best known for his epic poem, Os Lusíadas -- a tribute to the golden age of Portuguese exploration and discovery. This Nation has greatly benefited from the contributions of countless Portuguese-Americans. On this Day of Portugal, I proudly send my best wishes to all who celebrate Portuguese culture and heritage on this occasion.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
