In light of recent developments in Ukraine, the United States has taken steps to reassure allies in Central and Eastern Europe, and this trip is a chance to reaffirm our ironclad commitment to Article V as the foundation of NATO. After visiting Estonia, President Obama will proceed to Wales to participate in the Summit meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\n\n\n\n"
