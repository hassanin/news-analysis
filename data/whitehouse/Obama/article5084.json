Industry estimates have concluded that a successful expansion of the ITA agreement would eliminate tariffs on roughly $1 trillion in annual global sales of information and communications technology (ICT) products and increase annual global GDP by an estimated $190 billion. Because the U.S. is a global leader in high-tech manufacturing and production, industry also estimates that an expanded ITA will support up to 60,000 additional U.S. jobs. In addition, an agreement will lower costs for downstream manufacturing and services industries that rely on ICT parts and components as inputs, increasing their competitiveness.\n\n\t\tThe U.S.-China breakthrough is key to completing the ITA expansion. ITA expansion talks have been stalemated since disagreements among the parties resulted in suspension of negotiations in November 2013. Since that time, China and the United States have been working to narrow their differences, but without a breakthrough sufficient to resume talks among all WTO members involved.  A U.S.- China understanding has been widely viewed as a critical step toward completion of the agreement, with full talks now targeted for December in Geneva.\n\n\t\tThe U.S.-China breakthrough is the culmination of efforts coordinated across the Administration. The President has directly made ITA expansion a top economic priority since meeting with President Xi Jinping in Sunnylands in June 2013 and has regularly reiterated the importance of a mutually beneficial agreement.  The Office of the United States Trade Representative led efforts across the Administration on negotiating an agreement with assistance from the Departments of the Treasury and Commerce as well as the White House. Negotiations have taken place in Beijing and Geneva as well as at important U.S.-China economic fora including at the JCCT, the S&ED, in addition to numerous discussions on the margins of APEC meetings.     \n\n\t\tExpanding ITA supports U.S. manufacturing and technology industries. Many of the products that would see tariff elimination under an expanded ITA are in key U.S. industries that support good jobs, including in the manufacturing and technology sectors. A sample of some of the impacted products and the size of the tariff reduction they would benefit from, include:\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tNext generation semiconductors – Tariffs up to 25 percent reduced to zero.\n\n\t\t\t\tMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines -- Tariffs up to 8 percent reduced to zero.\n\n\t\t\t\tComputed Tomography (CT) scanners – Tariffs up to 8 percent reduced to zero.\n\n\t\t\t\tGlobal Positioning System (GPS) devices - Tariffs up to 8 percent reduced to zero.\n\n\t\t\t\tPrinted matter/cards to download software and games – Tariffs up to 10 percent reduced to zero.\n\n\t\t\t\tPrinter ink cartridges – Tariffs up to 25 percent reduced to zero.\n\n\t\t\t\tStatic converters and inductors – Tariffs up to 10 percent reduced to zero.\n\n\t\t\t\tLoudspeakers – Tariffs up to 30 percent reduced to zero.\n\n\t\t\t\tSoftware media, such as solid state drives - Tariffs up to 30 percent reduced to zero.\n\n\t\t\t\tVideo game consoles – Tariffs up to 30 percent reduced to zero.      \n\n\t\t\t\tAn expanded ITA would also eliminate import duties on a range of additional technology products including high-tech medical devices, video cameras, and an array of high-tech ICT testing instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
