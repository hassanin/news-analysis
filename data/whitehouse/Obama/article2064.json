Policy. Over the past generation, our society has made tremendous progress in eradicating barriers to women's success. A record number of women are attending college and graduate school. Women make up a growing share of our workforce, and more women are corporate executives and business owners than ever before, helping boost the U.S. economy and foster U.S. competitiveness around the world. Today, women are serving at the highest levels of all branches of our Government.\n\n\tDespite this progress, certain inequalities continue to persist. On average, American women continue to earn only about 78 cents for every dollar men make, and women are still significantly underrepresented in the science, engineering, and technology fields. Far too many women lack health insurance, and many are unable to take time off to care for a new baby or an ailing family member. Violence against women and girls remains a global epidemic. The challenge of ensuring equal educational opportunities for women and girls endures. As the current economic crisis has swept across our Nation, women have been seriously affected.\n\n\tThese issues do not concern just women. When jobs do not offer family leave, that affects men who wish to help care for their families. When women earn less than men for the same work, that affects families who have to work harder to make ends meet. When our daughters do not have the same educational and career opportunities as our sons, that affects entire communities, our economy, and our future as a Nation.\n\n\tThe purpose of this order is to establish a coordinated Federal response to issues that particularly impact the lives of women and girls and to ensure that Federal programs and policies address and take into account the distinctive concerns of women and girls, including women of color and those with disabilities.\n\n\tSec. 2. White House Council on Women and Girls. There is established within the Executive Office of the President a White House Council on Women and Girls (Council).\n\n\t(a) Membership of the Council. The Council shall consist of the following members:\n\n\t(1) the Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Liaison, who shall serve as Chair of the Council;\n\t(2) the Secretary of State;\n\t(3) the Secretary of the Treasury;\n\t(4) the Secretary of Defense;\n\t(5) the Attorney General;\n\t(6) the Secretary of the Interior;\n\t(7) the Secretary of Agriculture;\n\t(8) the Secretary of Commerce;\n\t(9) the Secretary of Labor;\n\t(10) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;\n\t(11) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;\n\t(12) the Secretary of Transportation;\n\t(13) the Secretary of Energy;\n\t(14) the Secretary of Education;\n\t(15) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;\n\t(16) the Secretary of Homeland Security;\n\t(17) the Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations;\n\t(18) the United States Trade Representative;\n\t(19) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;\n\t(20) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;\n\t(21) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;\n\t(22) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management;\n\t(23) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;\n\t(24) the Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy Council;\n\t(25) the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council; and\n\t(26) the heads of such other executive branch departments, agencies, and offices as the President may, from time to time, designate.\n\n\tA member of the Council may designate, to perform the Council functions of the member, a senior-level official who is a part of the member's department, agency, or office, and who is a full-time officer or employee of the Federal Government.
