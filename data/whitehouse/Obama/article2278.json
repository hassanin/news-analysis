As part of the naming process, Iowa school children submitted pairs of names for this year’s turkeys.\nAfter the pardoning, the turkeys will be on display for visitors at their permanent home at Virginia Tech’s newly built “Gobblers Rest” exhibit where they will be cared for by students and veterinarians in the university’s Animal and Poultry Sciences Department. \nBoth birds were raised in Northwest Iowa under the supervision of National Turkey Federation Chairman John Reicks.\nThe National Turkey Federation will bring two dressed turkeys for the First Family to donate.
