More than 4,000 students from across New York high schools will be in attendance.  \n\n\tThis event will be hosted by MTV in conjunction with Viacom's Get Schooled initiative.\n\n\tThis will be the third annual College Signing Day that the First Lady has hosted to celebrate high school seniors choosing to pursue higher education at a professional training program, a community college, or a four-year college or university. The First Lady has hosted College Signing Day events in Detroit, Michigan in 2015 and in San Antonio, Texas in 2014. \n\n\tIn addition to the First Lady’s event in New York, over 500 College Signing Day events have been planned across the country by communities, students, and organizations committed to helping students pursue higher education.  Education Secretary John B. King Jr. will attend a College Signing Day event in Washington, D.C.  \n\n\tCollege Signing Day continues the First Lady’s efforts to inspire young people to pursue their education past high school. Last October, the First Lady launched Better Make Room, a public awareness campaign targeted at Generation Z, or young people ages 14-19, to celebrate education, change the national conversation, and give students the tools and resources they need to continue their education past high school.\n\n\n\n\n"
