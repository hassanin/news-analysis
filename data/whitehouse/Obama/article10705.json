Violence robs women and girls of their full potential and causes untold human suffering.  Violence against women impedes economic development, threatens peace and prosperity, and inhibits full participation in civic life. For every woman who has been beaten in her own home, for the millions of women who have been raped as a weapon of war, for every girl who has been attacked on her way to school, for all of the children - girls and boys - who have witnessed this brutality, we must do better.  On this International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, we join with the world community in calling for an end to these abuses. Our Global Development Policy makes clear our commitment to investing in the health, education and rights of women. Today, we are working to reduce gender-based violence in schools, provide care for rape victims, and train health workers. The U.S. government is committed to continuing our efforts to respond to, reduce, and work toward eliminating gender-based violence worldwide.”\n\n\n\n\n"
