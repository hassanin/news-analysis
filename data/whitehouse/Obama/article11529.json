The campaign will begin with a $1 million national radio buy that will run in June through August as $250 tax-free rebate checks get mailed to eligible seniors each month.\nPROGRAM PARTICIPANTS\nHHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will moderate the Q and A session. \nCarol Fuentevilla, Director of the Holiday Park Multipurpose Senior Center, will introduce Secretary Sebelius.\nCarol Fuentevilla has been the Holiday Park Center and Program Director for 8 years. In all, she has been with the center for 20 years, as program director. Senior health and housing issues have been her priority for 40 years. She started work with the Philadelphia Corporation for Aging in 1970. She is originally from Philadelphia and moved to the Washington area 28 years ago. Before her time at Holiday Park, she worked at the Senior Housing Opportunity Commission Buildings working on social and recreation issues.\nFran Garfinkle will introduce the President.\nFran and her husband Eddie are retired small business owners with private health insurance until they qualified for Medicare. Two years ago they began collecting Social Security benefits while continuing to work part-time for supplemental income. \nIn December 2007, Fran was diagnosed with breast cancer and faced surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and medications.  Last July when Fran went to fill her prescription she was told by the pharmacist that she fell into the “donut hole” and would have to pay for the medicine on her own. And on top of that, she would also have to pay the full price for the 3 other medications she needed.  Fran researched alternatives but there were no free samples available, no generic equivalent, and she didn’t qualify for any of the drug assistance programs. Faced with expensive medication costs on a fixed income, she and her husband cut as many corners as they could and were able to purchase the prescriptions that Fran needed last year.  Then in May of this year, she received the news that she had again reached the “donut hole” and would be responsible for paying the full cost of her prescription drugs.\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, Fran will be one of the millions of seniors who will receive a $250 “donut hole” rebate check to help pay for her prescriptions.\nELECTED OFFICIALS EXPECTED TO ATTEND\nUS Senator Barbara Mikulski \nUS Representative Donna Edwards \nUS Representative Chris Van Hollen \nGovernor Martin O’Malley\nState Senator Richard Madaleno\nState Delegate Alfred Carr, Jr.\nState Delegate Jeff Waldstreicher\nState Delegate Ana Sol Gutierrez\nLIST OF SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS AND GROUPS\nHHS has worked with the below listed supporting organizations and groups to send a conference call-in number for the town hall to over 400,000 seniors and set up over 100 watch parties in senior centers and private homes across the country.\nAARP\nAFL-CIO\nAFSCME Retirees\nAlliance for Retired Americans\nAmerican Association of Homes and Services for the Aging \nAmerican Federation of Teachers Program on Retirement and Retirees\nAmerican Postal Workers Union Retirees Department \nB’nai B’rith International\nCenter for Medicare Advocacy, Inc\nCommunications Workers of American Retiree Division\nEaster Seals\nFamilies USA\nInternational Union of Painters & Allied Trades (IUPAT)\nMedicare Rights Center\nNational Academy of Elder Law Attorneys\nNational Association of Area Agencies on Aging \nNational Association of State Units on Aging \nNational Association of Nutrition and Aging Services Programs\nNational Association of State Long Term Care Ombudsman Programs\nThe National Caucus and Center on Black Aged  \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare \nNational Council on Aging \nThe National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care (NCCNHR)\nNational Gay and Lesbian Task Force\nThe Voice of Midlife and Older Women (OWL)\nSEIU\nService and Advocacy for GLBT Elders\nWorkers United\n\n\n\n"
