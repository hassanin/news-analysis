The President’s advisors updated him on policy considerations for new measures pertaining to returning healthcare workers, whose selfless efforts are critical to fighting this epidemic in West Africa. The President underscored that the steps we take must be guided by the best medical science, as informed by our most knowledgeable public health experts. He also emphasized that these measures must recognize that healthcare workers are an indispensable element of our effort to lead the international community to contain and ultimately end this outbreak at its source, and should be crafted so as not to unnecessarily discourage those workers from serving. He directed his team to formulate policies based on these principles in order to offer the highest level of protection to the American people.\n \nParticipants:\n\nThe Vice President (via telephone)\nJohn Kerry, Secretary of State\nChuck Hagel, Secretary of Defense\nEric Holder, Attorney General\nSylvia Burwell, Secretary of Health and Human Services\nJeh Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Secretary\nDenis McDonough, Chief of Staff\nShaun Donovan, Director of the Office of Management and Budget\nAmb.
