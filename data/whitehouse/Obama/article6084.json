With this important step, Minnesota joins a growing coalition of states, cities, counties and businesses that have taken action to do the right thing for their workers and their citizens. I commend the state legislature for raising their minimum wage and we look forward to Governor Dayton signing the bill into law soon.  I urge Congress to follow Minnesota’s lead, raise the federal minimum wage, and lift wages for 28 million Americans.  Congress should listen to the majority of Americans who say it’s time to give America a raise and help ensure that no American who works full time has to raise a family in poverty.\n\n\n\n\n"
