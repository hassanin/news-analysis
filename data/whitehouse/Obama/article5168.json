The President noted the extensive preparations that New York City and, in particular, Bellevue Hospital Center, where the patient is being treated, have undertaken to prepare for this contingency. They discussed the deployment of officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), some of whom were already on the ground in New York City, and the President noted that an additional CDC response team would be in New York City by late Thursday night. The President offered the Governor and Mayor any additional federal support necessary to provide the highest standard of patient care, maintain the strictest safety protocols for healthcare workers, and to identify and, as necessary, monitor any contacts of the patient potentially at risk of exposure. The President expressed that his thoughts and prayers are with the patient and concluded the call by asking the Governor and Mayor to remain in close contact with his team, including Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, Ebola Response Coordinator Ron Klain, and CDC Director Tom Frieden.\n\n\n\n\n"
