The President’s advisors updated him on the status of the contact tracing process to identify and, as necessary, monitor all individuals who may have come into contact with the Ebola patients in Dallas following their exposure. The team also discussed plans to augment resources available to state and local authorities in Dallas.  Specifically, in order to ensure the Dallas response is nimble and capable of leveraging effective coordination between the federal, state, and local levels—as well as with frontline healthcare workers—the administration, working closely with state and local officials, will support or designate the appointment of senior personnel to serve on the ground in Dallas. These officials include:\n\n\n\t\tAn experienced Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) coordinator to ensure all federal assistance is meeting the most urgent needs; and,\n\n\t\tA White House liaison to fulfill the President’s pledge to provide all necessary federal resources.\n\nThe President underscored that the domestic response to Ebola cases must be seamless at all levels, just as we continue to move forward expeditiously with a whole-of-government approach to counter the outbreak at its source in West Africa.\nParticipants:\n\n\n\t\tThe Vice President\n\n\t\tChuck Hagel, Secretary of Defense\n\n\t\tSylvia Burwell, Secretary of Health and Human Services\n\n\t\tJeh Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security\n\n\t\tDenis McDonough, Chief of Staff\n\n\t\tShaun Donovan, Director of the Office of Management and Budget\n\n\t\tJohn Podesta, Counselor to the President\n\n\t\tSusan Rice, National Security Advisor\n\n\t\tGeneral Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n\n\t\tSamantha Power, Permanent U.S. Representative to the United Nations (via secure video conference)\n\n\t\tDr. John Holdren, Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy\n\n\t\tDr. Thomas Frieden, Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n\t\tLisa Monaco, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism\n\n\t\tRajiv Shah, Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development\n\n\t\tNancy Powell, State Department Ebola Coordinator\n\n\t\tKatie Beirne Fallon, Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs\n\n\t\tJennifer Palmieri, Director of Communications\n\n\t\tJoshua Earnest, Press Secretary\n\n\t\tSuzanne George, Executive Secretary and Chief of Staff of the National Security Council\n\n\t\tBrian Egan, National Security Council Legal Advisor\n\n\t\tRand Beers, Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\n\n"
