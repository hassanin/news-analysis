    "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary\n\n\n\nApril 11, 2016\n\n \n\n\n\nStatement by the President\n\n\n\n\n\n\tI applaud the California State Legislature and Governor Jerry Brown for expanding paid family leave in their state today.  This action means more hardworking Californians will have the peace of mind to know that they can take care of a new child or a sick family member.  This is great news for California.  Yet millions of Americans still don’t have access to any form of paid leave.  Congress needs to catch up to California – and to countries all over the world – by acting to guarantee paid family leave to all Americans.  As long as I am President, I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that working Americans have access to this basic security.\n\n\n\n\n"
