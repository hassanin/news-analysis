Community solar allows multiple households and businesses to pool their resources and invest in shared solar systems to save on their energy bills. Today, private sector organizations are building on the initial commitments announced in July, bringing the total number of pledges to advance community solar and scale up solar and for low- and moderate- income households to more than 20,000 households and $545 million across 21states.\n\n\tActions like the ones announced today, will help the U.S. transition to cleaner sources of energy faster and ensure the opportunity to access clean energy is available to those who need it most, putting the U.S. on a strong playing field to secure an ambitious climate agreement in Paris.   \n\n\tSince President Obama took office, the amount of solar power installed in the U.S. has increased nearly twenty fold. Since the beginning of 2010, the average cost of a solar electric system has dropped by 50 percent. However, nearly 50 percent of American households and businesses are renters or lack the capital and adequate roof space to install solar systems.\n\n\tCommunity solar has the potential to unlock economic growth across the United States while providing clean solar power to historically underserved communities and allowing them to benefit from the falling costs and increased deployment of solar. Low-income households, which spend four times greater proportion of their income on energy than the national median, can see significant benefits from community solar. Access to solar power could substantially reduce the energy burden of low-income households by providing stable electricity prices below local utility rates.\n\nSTATE, LOCAL, AND PRIVATE SECTOR COMMITMENTS\n\nTO INCREASE ACCESS TO SOLAR ANNOUNCED TODAY\n\nScaling Up National Community Solar Partnership Members: To unlock access to solar power for these Americans, in July the Administration launched the National Community Solar Partnership. The partnership is a collaboration between the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), representatives from solar companies, NGOs, and state and local community leaders. The members work together to leverage the interest in the public and private sector to expand access to community solar, with an emphasis on low- and moderate- income households, while utilizing the technical expertise of DOE and its national laboratories. This includes working on greater utilization of existing federal and state resources, sharing of best practices at the state level, development of new financing arrangements and business models, new approaches to customer acquisition and community building, and multifamily deployment considerations. Today, we are announcing that, since July, more than 40 companies, organizations and universities have joined the effort to increase access to community solar, nearly tripling the number of partners to 68:\n\n\n\t\t3Degrees – San Francisco, CA\n\n\t\tAmazon – Seattle, WA\n\n\t\tArcadia Power – Washington, DC\n\n\t\tBARC Electric Cooperative – Millboro, VA\n\n\t\tBlack Rock Solar – San Francisco, CA\n\n\t\tBishop Paiute Tribe – Bishop, CA\n\n\t\tBlueWave Capital – Boston, MA\n\n\t\tCiti – New York, NY\n\n\t\tClean Energy Collective – Louisville, CO\n\n\t\tClean Energy Solutions – Boston, MA\n\n\t\tColorado State Energy Office – Denver, CO\n\n\t\tCommunity Energy, Inc. – Radnor, PA\n\n\t\tConnecticut Green Bank – Rocky Hill, CT\n\n\t\tCook County Department of Environmental Control – Chicago, IL\n\n\t\tDistrict of Columbia Department of the Environment – Washington, DC\n\n\t\tEcolibrium3 – Duluth, MN\n\n\t\tElevate Energy – Chicago, IL\n\n\t\tEveryday Energy – Carlsbad, CA\n\n\t\tFirst Solar, Inc. – Tempe, AZ\n\n\t\tFresh Energy – St. Paul, MN\n\n\t\tGlobal Green USA – Santa Monica, CA\n\n\t\tGrand Valley Power – Grand Junction, CO\n\n\t\tGreater Cincinnati Energy Alliance – Cincinnati, OH\n\n\t\tGRID Alternatives – Oakland, CA\n\n\t\tGroundswell – Brooklyn, NY\n\n\t\tHawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism – Honolulu, HI\n\n\t\tInovus Solar – Boise, ID\n\n\t\tInstitute for Sustainable Communities – Montpelier, VT\n\n\t\tInterstate Renewable Energy Council – Latham, NY\n\n\t\tMassachusetts Clean Energy Center – Boston, MA\n\n\t\tMassachusetts, Dept. of Energy Resources – Boston, MA\n\n\t\tMeister Consultants Group – Boston, MA\n\n\t\tNational League of Cities – Washington, DC\n\n\t\tNext Step Living – Boston, MA\n\n\t\tNorthwest SEED – Seattle, WA\n\n\t\tPedernales Electric Cooperative – Johnson City, TX\n\n\t\tPfister Energy of Baltimore – Baltimore, MD\n\n\t\tPosigen – New Orleans, LA\n\n\t\tRazor Sharp Solar – Littleton, CO\n\n\t\tRE–volv – San Francisco, CA\n\n\t\tRocky Mountain Institute – Boulder, CO\n\n\t\tRREAL – Pine River, MN\n\n\t\tSacramento Municipal Utility District, - Sacramento, California\n\n\t\tState of California \n\n\t\tState of New York\n\n\t\tSolar Energy Industries Association – Washington, DC\n\n\t\tSolar Electric Power Association – Washington, DC\n\n\t\tSolar Gardens Institute – Westminster, CO\n\n\t\tSolar One – New York, NY\n\n\t\tSolarCity – San Mateo, CA\n\n\t\tSolstice Initiative – Boston, MA\n\n\t\tSpear Point Energy – Aspen, CO\n\n\t\tSunShare – Denver, CO\n\n\t\tSustainable Capital Advisors – Washington, DC\n\n\t\tTucson Electric Power – Tucson, AZ\n\n\t\tTegDB – Richmond, TX\n\n\t\tThe Solar Foundation – Washington, DC\n\n\t\tUniversity of Houston – Houston, TX\n\n\t\tUniversity of Maine – Orono, ME\n\n\t\tUniversity of Minnesota – Minneapolis, MN\n\n\t\tU.S. Department of Agriculture\n\n\t\tU.S. Department of Energy\n\n\t\tU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\n\n\t\tU.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n\n\t\tVermont Energy Investment Corporation – Burlington, VT\n\n\t\tVermont Public Service Department – Montpelier, VT\n\n\t\tWest Monroe Partners – Chicago, IL\n\n\t\tVote Solar – Washington, DC\n\n\nPrivate Sector Companies Announcing Commitments to Increase Financing for and Deployment of Community Solar Across the Country: Today, private sector organizations are building on the initial commitments announced in July, bringing the total number of pledges to advance community solar and scale up solar and for low- and moderate- income households to more than 20,000 households and $545 million across 21 states.\n\n\nClean Energy Collective (CEC) is announcing that it has developed the first program that allows investor-owned utilities to own and rate-base community arrays without non-participant subsidization or upward pressure on rates. This program builds upon its industry-leading efforts to partner with utilities in implementing community solar programs. Prompted by New York’s newly enacted shared renewables program, CEC is bringing community solar to New York, empowering residential and business consumers to tap the financial and environmental benefits of local shared renewable energy generation—regardless of income level, home or business location, or property ownership. Development is already underway on more than a dozen project sites from the five boroughs of New York City to upstate.\n\nGroundswell is committing to convene five community solar projects that will serve low- and moderate-income communities in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast over the next 18 months. This builds on Groundswell’s seven years of experience educating, engaging, and organizing economically diverse households and small businesses to switch to affordable renewable energy. These projects will make solar available to the nearly 50 percent of customers who currently cannot access it, while also delivering more distributed generation capacity that promotes reliability, resiliency, and sustainability across the power grid.\n\nFirst Solar, Inc. and Clean Energy Collective, LLC (CEC) are announcing today that they are partnering on  an initial four community solar projects that will serve customers of Black Hills Energy (Pueblo, CO), CPS Energy (San Antonio, TX), Nueces Electric Cooperative (Corpus Christi, TX), and Holy Cross Energy (Rifle, CO). Combined, these projects introduce the concept of community solar to nearly one million potential residential users, many of whom would not be able to install solar on their own homes.\n\nRE-volv is announcing today the launch of a crowdfunding platform in early 2016 to finance solar energy systems for nonprofits and cooperatives.

This commitment builds on the launch of a new business subsidiary, Sun Shares LLC, which is aimed at using the innovative design strategies of community solar brought to the employer/employee benefit sector.\n\nNext Step Living is committing to generate at least 20,000 reservations for community solar arrays over the next 12 months. This commitment builds on successfully securing nearly 11,000 reservations to date.\n\n\nBUILDING ON EXISTING INITIATIVES AND RESEARCH \n\n\tThe National Community Solar Partnership was formed in response to the research of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) 2012 Guide to Community Shared Solar, which provides a framework for the development of this model for solar deployment in communities. The SunShot Initiative is also seeking applications for the next round of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants, which includes community solar. In addition, the Department of Energy’s SunShot Initiative is helping local governments and utilities create community solar programs through the following initiatives:\n\n\nSolar Powering America by Recognizing Communities (SPARC) is establishing a national recognition and technical assistance program for local governments to make their communities more solar-friendly and ignite local solar markets. The SPARC designation will spur communities across the country to earn recognition for achievements that distinguish them from their peers as they eliminate market barriers and reduce soft costs.\n\nSunShot Incubator program provides early-stage assistance to help startup companies cross technological barriers to commercialization while encouraging private sector investment. Three recent projects, from the Clean Energy Collective, Sunvestment Group, and Village Power Finance, are tackling the technological barriers of managing community solar projects.\n\nSolar Market Pathways program supports 15 SunShot projects that are advancing solar deployment across the United States. These projects take a variety of approaches to develop actionable strategic plans to expand solar electricity use for residential, community, and commercial properties. Seven projects are currently developing best practices and toolkits for launching community solar projects across the country.\n\nSunShot Catalyst Energy Innovation Prize is an open innovation prize challenge that aims to catalyze the rapid creation and development of products and solutions that address near-term challenges in the U.S. solar marketplace. The current prize cycle features two companies, SunSwarm and MapMySolar, which are building prototype systems to make it easier and faster to deploy community solar.\n\nSolar Utility Networks: Replicable Innovations in Solar Energy (SUNRISE) program is helping utilities develop adaptable and replicable practices, long-term strategic plans, and technical solutions to sustain reliable operations with large proportions of solar power on the grid.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
