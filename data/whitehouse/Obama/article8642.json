Always a champion of his fellow New Yorkers, Gary was also successful in enacting a bill to create the “Heroes” postage stamp, which benefitted the families of rescue workers killed or permanently disabled while responding to the 9/11 attacks.  Gary’s unique enthusiasm will be greatly missed in the halls of Congress, but I am confident he will continue to serve the people of New York for years to come. Michelle and I wish him and his family well in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"
