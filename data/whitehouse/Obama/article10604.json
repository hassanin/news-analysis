Our country is in\n\tthe midst of an economic crisis. Now is not the time to raise people's taxes ... nor is it the time to leave\n\tthousands of unemployed Miamians - or millions of unemployed Americans - out in the cold. Both\n\twould be disastrous to our local and national economy.\n\t \n\tIn the City of Miami we made some very difficult decisions this budget year that required a lot of\n\tcompromise too. We recognized that people are suffering and that raising their taxes would be wrong, so\n\twe held the line.\n\t \n\tOur economic recovery requires leaders that are willing to work with both parties and put the American\n\tpeople above partisan politics. I am happy to see that the President is listening to us and doing that.\n\t \n\tSincerely,\n\tTomas Regalado\n\n\n\n\n"
