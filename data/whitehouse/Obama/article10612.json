Riley, Jr. today expressed support for President Obama’s compromise agreement with Congressional leaders that will result in the extension of middle-class tax relief and unemployment benefits to Americans who have lost their jobs during this deep economic recession. This deal was needed to help those in our community who are in need and to stimulate our economy. Without this bargain, income taxes on the middle class would rise, unemployment insurance for millions of Americans would expire, and other important tax relief measures for working people would be unavailable.\n\n\tMayor Riley said, “I would like to commend President Obama for his decision to build a bipartisan compromise on tax relief on behalf of the citizens of Charleston and the American people. He could have taken another route and sought to score political points through a protracted debate. Instead, he took the thoughtful and constructive path that protects the tax cuts that working families in America need now, extends unemployment benefits to those of us hardest hit by the recession, and at the same time take no risks with harming our already fragile economy. His actions showed leadership and political courage. The American people elected him to rise above politics and to take action to get our country moving, and that is what he has done.”\n\n\n\n\n"
