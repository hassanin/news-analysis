More than 3,000 recipes have been identified across 18 websites, and today nearly 1,000 of these recipes have been collected on a new Pinterest page associated with the effort, providing a one-stop-shop where parents, beginner home cooks and even the most experienced chefs can find and share healthier recipes.\n\t \n\t“As a mom, I know how challenging it can be to think of new meal ideas that your kids will like and that will be good for them,” said First Lady Michelle Obama. “This partnership takes the guess work out of finding healthier recipes and gives parents the information and the tools they need to make healthy choices for their families every day.”\n\t \n\tBelow is a list of publications participating in this collaborative effort:\n\t• Allrecipes.com\n\t• Better Homes & Gardens\n\t• CookingLight.com\n\t• CountryLiving.com\n\t• Delish.com\n\t• DiabeticlivingOnline.com\n\t• EatingWell.com\n\t• Epicurious.com\n\t• Everyday with Rachael Ray\n\t• FamilyCircle.com\n\t• FoodNetwork.com\n\t• GoodHousekeeping.com\n\t• MyRecipes.com\n\t• Parents.com\n\t• RealSimple.com\n\t• Redbook.com\n\t• Recipe.com\n\t• Woman’sDay.com\n\t \n\tFor more information on this partnership, visit www.pinterest.com/MyPlateRecipes\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
