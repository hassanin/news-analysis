In casting their ballots, the Kyrgyz people have taken an important and courageous step on the path of democracy and demonstrated their commitment to an orderly and open transition of power. I commend President Otunbayeva for her leadership and for her dedication to a vision of peaceful, democratic change. I also congratulate the many Kyrgyz leaders in government and civil society who worked to realize this moment of promise. The people of Kyrgyzstan will have a partner in the United States as they undertake the hard work of building upon the democratic gains of the past eighteen months and realizing a democratic, prosperous and just future for all Kyrgyz citizens.\n\n\n\n\n"
