Alaska is the 29th state in addition to the District of Columbia to implement this option and prioritize the health of the state’s citizens over narrow political interests. Hospitals and businesses throughout Alaska will save on uncompensated care costs, and hardworking families will gain the peace of mind that comes with health security. Today’s news is an important step in ensuring that all Americans have access to quality, affordable health insurance, and we'll continue to work with the 21 states that have not yet taken advantage of Federal funds to expand Medicaid eligibility to over 4 million Americans who needlessly remain uninsured.\n\n\n\n\n"
