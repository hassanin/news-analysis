This Protocol was signed in Brussels on May 19, 2016, on behalf of the United States and the other Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is an overview of the Protocol by the Department of State. Full ratification of the Protocol by the United States and our allies will allow Montenegro to become a Party to the North Atlantic Treaty and a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\n\tArticle 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which outlines NATO's Open Door policy, is part of the doctrinal foundation of the Alliance. Montenegro's accession to NATO will demonstrate to other countries in the Balkans and beyond that NATO's door remains open to nations that undertake the reforms necessary to meet NATO's requirements and contribute to the security of the Alliance, and is yet another milestone in advancing the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Balkans. I am pleased that, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and the ratifications of this Protocol by our NATO allies, Montenegro can soon join us as a member of this great Alliance.\n\n\tI ask the Senate to continue working with me in advancing a Europe whole, free, and at peace by providing its prompt advice and consent to ratification for this Protocol of Accession. My Administration stands ready to brief and assist you in your deliberations.\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tJune 28, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n"
