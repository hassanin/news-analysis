They accept the risks that come with service because they understand that they are making vital contributions to our national interests and national security.  We owe it to all of them to do everything in our power to protect our personnel serving overseas.\nIn the wake of the attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in September 2012, the Department of State reviewed its global security posture and took steps necessary to address security vulnerabilities, including submitting a request to reallocate $1.4 billion in FY 2013 resources to begin work this year that was approved by the Congress.\nIn addition to the $1.4 billion requested in FY 2013, the FY 2014 budget request provides over $4 billion for the Department of State’s embassy security programs, fully supporting this critical priority.  As part of this effort, the budget includes $2.2 billion to support increased embassy security construction recommend by the Benghazi Accountability Review Board (ARB).\nThe budget fully supports the resources necessary to address all recommendations made by the Benghazi ARB including increased embassy security construction, expanded Marine Security Guard detachments at US diplomatic facilities, increased security training, and support for a 5% increase in diplomatic security staff.\nIn addition to resources, the Department of State needs authority to address immediate security concerns.  The Department should have authority to transfer resources that are necessary to provide secure facilities for our personnel overseas.  For instance, in doing so, it should have the authority to draw from other State Department operating accounts.\nThe President will continue to do everything in his power to make sure a tragedy like this never happens again.  But as the President said, we can’t do this alone and the President will continue to urge members of Congress to work together on behalf of the American people.\n\n\n\n\n(BA in Millions)\n\n\n2012\nActual\n\n\n2013\nEnacted\n\n\n2014\nRequest\n\n\n\n\nOperations (WSP)                                                                        \n\n\n\t\t\t\t$1,591  \n\n\t\t\t\t$2,250  \n\n\t\t\t\t$2,182\n\n\n\nConstruction (WSU)                                                                            \n\n\n\t\t\t\t$775 \n\n\t\t\t\t$1,897   \n\n\t\t\t\t$1,864\n\n\n\nTotal State Security Programs1                                                    \n\n\n\t\t\t\t$2,366  \n\n\t\t\t\t $4,147 \n\n\t\t\t\t$4,046\n\n\n\n1FY 13 Enacted include the Department of State’s $1.4 billion for embassy security in the wake of the September 11, 2012 Benghazi Attacks\n \n\n\n\n\n"
