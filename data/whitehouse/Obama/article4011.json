Rice’s Meeting with IAEA Director General Amano\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNational Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met today with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano at the White House.  Ambassador Rice reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to the IAEA and the important missions it undertakes in furtherance of international security and promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  She expressed the President’s appreciation for the critical work the IAEA has been conducting to verify Iran’s compliance under the Joint Plan of Action and reiterated the confidence the United States and our P-5+1 partners have in the IAEA’s ability to verify effectively the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If fully implemented, the JCPOA will verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  The two also discussed the status of the IAEA’s investigation into the possible military dimensions of Iran’s nuclear program, and Ambassador Rice emphasized the U.S. Government’s support for addressing all outstanding questions about Iran’s nuclear program, as required by the JCPOA. Ambassador Rice assured the IAEA Director General that the United States and its partners would ensure that the IAEA has the resources it needs to carry out this mission fully and effectively.\n\n\n\n\n"
