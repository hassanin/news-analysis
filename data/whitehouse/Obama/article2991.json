With regard to the growing threat posed by ISIL and the destabilizing impact of criminal smuggling networks, they agreed on the strong and urgent need to support the Libyan people in growing the economy and building the capacity of the security sector.  This would help counter criminal smuggling networks and counter the threat posed by ISIL.  They agreed that these efforts should be undertaken at the request of the Libyan government and be supported by the international community. The leaders also urged NATO and the EU to draw on their experience in the Aegean to explore how they could work together to address in an orderly and humane way migrant flows in the central Mediterranean.\n\n\tOn Ukraine, leaders reiterated their rejection of Russia’s occupation and attempted annexation of the Crimea. There was agreement that full implementation of the Minsk agreements remained crucial. The leaders reiterated that sanctions against Russia would be lifted if the Minsk agreements were fully implemented.\n\n\tFinally, the leaders discussed the importance of concluding an ambitious Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement, which would expand growth and create jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\n\n"
