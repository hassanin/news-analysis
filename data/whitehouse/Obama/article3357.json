Monaco's Visit to France\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Lisa Monaco, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism concluded a series of meetings with French security and intelligence officials to discuss ways to strengthen counterterrorism cooperation in the wake of the tragic terrorist attacks of November 13, 2015, in Paris. During discussions with French Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve, Senior Military Advisor General Benoit Puga, and General Directorate for Internal Security Director Patrick Calvar, Ms. Monaco discussed ways to further enhance our security and intelligence cooperation and information sharing with France --including against the flow of foreign terrorist fighters-- to disrupt terror plots and prevent future attacks. Ms. Monaco also discussed with French counterparts the intensified efforts of the United States in our multipronged effort against ISIL. Minister Cazeneuve, General Puga, and Director Calvar thanked Ms. Monaco for unwavering U.S. support to France in the aftermath of the November 2015 attacks and expressed appreciation for our subsequent enhanced intelligence and law enforcement cooperation. Ms. Monaco reiterated that the United States will continue to support France in its efforts to bring to justice those who helped plan or enable these attacks. Noting that France is one of our strongest partners in the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, Ms. Monaco discussed a number of ways we can continue to enhance our respective whole-of-government efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL.\n\n\n\n\n"
