Burwell and Halbig v. Burwell\n\n\n\n\n \nAnother partisan attempt to harm the Affordable Care Act failed today.  This latest attempt was undermined by a unanimous judicial panel in the 4th Circuit. The law was designed to make health care affordable through tax credits – and it is working.\n\n\n\n\n"
