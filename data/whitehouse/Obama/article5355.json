We are watching closely developments since the announcement of the ceasefire and agreement in Minsk, but we have yet to see conclusive evidence that Russia has ceased its efforts to destabilize Ukraine.  \nWe will deepen and broaden sanctions in Russia’s financial, energy, and defense sectors. These measures will increase Russia’s political isolation as well as the economic costs to Russia, especially in areas of importance to President Putin and those close to him.  My Administration will outline the specifics of these new sanctions tomorrow. \nThe international community continues to seek a genuine negotiated solution to the crisis in Ukraine.  I encourage President Putin to work with Ukraine and other international partners, within the context of the Minsk agreement and without setting unreasonable conditions, to reach a lasting resolution to the conflict.  As I said last week, if Russia fully implements its commitments, these sanctions can be rolled back.  If, instead, Russia continues its aggressive actions and violations of international law, the costs will continue to rise.\n\n\n\n\n"
