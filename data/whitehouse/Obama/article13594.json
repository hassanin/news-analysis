This is the first time the egg design has been available to families prior to the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, to be held on Monday, April 13th.  This year’s Easter Egg Roll activities build on the theme of ‘Let’s Go Play,’ which will seek to educate children on the importance of living a healthy and active lifestyle. This year’s egg is the ‘greenest’ egg in White House Easter Egg Roll history.       The 2009 egg:  Uses 31% less paperboard than the 2008 designs Eliminates the need for the paper shred/filler Features an egg-shaped dye cut instead of a cellophane window Uses renewable, vegetable oil-based inks  Interested families can view the egg online and purchase it via the National Parks Foundation at www.nationalparks.org/WhiteHouseEasterEgg   The 2009 Easter egg can be found at: obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/eastereggroll   Commemorative eggs can also be purchased through the White House Historical Association at:   White House Historical Association  740 Jackson Place, Washington, DC N.W.   and   White House Visitor Center  1450 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC N.W.\n\n\n\n"
