Board of Education case that desegregated our schools.  A decade later, he represented Dr. King in Birmingham Jail.  He learned quickly that change would not come overnight -- that it would take many generations, more court cases, and nationwide movements to even begin realizing the dream of civil rights for all Americans.  But Jack’s calm temperament and intellectual approach to moral arguments perfectly suited him for the fight; he knew, after all, that history was on his side.  Michelle and I offer our thoughts and prayers to his wife, Deborah, his children, and all those who loved him dearly and have benefited from his strong sense of right and wrong. \n\n\n\n\n"
