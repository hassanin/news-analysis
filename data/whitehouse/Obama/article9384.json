His plan, the American Jobs Act, will create new jobs for teachers, veterans and construction workers. It will cut taxes for small business owners and middle class families and give tax credits to companies that hire new workers. And it gives much needed support those who have been unemployed for far too long.\n\n\t“This is a good plan, a fair plan and is fully paid for.”\n\n\t“Most of these proposals have been supported by both Democrats and Republicans in the past. We need to set partisanship aside and work together to put America back to work.”\n\n\n\n\n"
