We also commend the courageous response by Kenyan security personnel and first responders, including the Kenyan Red Cross, who stepped forward to help their fellow citizens.\n \nThe perpetrators of this heinous act must be brought to justice, and we have offered our full support to the Kenyan Government to do so.  We will continue to stand with the Kenyan people in their efforts to confront terrorism in all its forms, including the threat posed by al-Shabaab.  This cowardly act against innocent civilians will not shake our resolve.\n\n\n\n"
