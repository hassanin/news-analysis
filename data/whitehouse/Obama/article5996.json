Hawaii joins a large and growing coalition of states, cities, counties and businesses that have given their citizens and employees the raise they deserve. This important step in Hawaii is yet another sign that the American people support raising the minimum wage, and I urge Republicans in Congress to follow Hawaii’s lead and lift wages for 28 million Americans. With a Senate vote on this crucial issue planned for today, it’s time for Republicans in Congress to listen to the majority of Americans who say it’s time to give America a raise.\n\n\n\n\n"
