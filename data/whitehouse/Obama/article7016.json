He had been serving a 40-year prison term for the 1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena. We have seen reports that another individual connected to Camarena's killing could also be released. We remain as committed today in seeing Quintero and others involved in this crime face justice in the United States as we were in the immediate aftermath of Kiki Camarena's murder and will work closely with the Mexican authorities on this.\n\n\n\n\n"
