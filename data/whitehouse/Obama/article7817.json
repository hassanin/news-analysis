Nearly 80% of the electorate voted, continuing the Ghanaian tradition of widespread public participation in the democratic process. This is the sixth successful presidential and parliamentary election since 1992, and further demonstrates the people of Ghanaâ€™s commitment to democracy and the rule of law. The United States encourages all parties to accept the results and to use the appropriate legal processes to resolve any electoral disputes. The United States places a high value on its long-standing friendship and partnership with Ghana and the Ghanaian people. We look forward to strengthening our bonds by working with President Mahama and the people of Ghana to ensure prosperity, peace, and further democratic development of Ghana and the region.\n\n\n\n\n"
