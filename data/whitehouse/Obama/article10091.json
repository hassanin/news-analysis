John always stood by his principles, and served with an unwavering energy for the causes he believed in: creating jobs, providing tax relief for New Jersey families and standing up for seniors and veterans.\n\n\tOur hearts and prayers go out to Johnâ€™s wife Shelley and his sons Jeffrey, Alex, Andrew and Oliver. John was taken from us far too soon, and he will be greatly missed.\n\n\n\n\n"
