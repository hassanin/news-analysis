He then fielded questions for about a half-hour from members of Congress about his budget priorities.   The meeting ended with the President thanking Chairman John Spratt for his hard work and asking the assembled members for their support on the budget.    During the meeting, Speaker Pelosi presented the President with the flag that flew over the Capitol the day of his address to a joint session of Congress.      \n\n\n\n"
