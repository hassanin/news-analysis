The President reiterated that government alone can never fill the void that causes a child to turn to violence, but that we all have a responsibility to do our part to create safe communities and save lives. The President applauded the mayors for their local efforts to combat violence, solicited their input about proven methods, and pledged his Administration’s partnership. He also vowed to continue doing everything in his power to combat gun violence through executive action and to press Congress to pass common-sense reforms like expanding the background check system and cracking down on gun trafficking.\nThe following mayors attended the meeting:\n\n\n\t\tMayor Greg Ballard (Indianapolis, IN)\n\n\t\tMayor Tom Barrett (Milwaukee, WI)\n\n\t\tMayor Cory Booker (Newark, NJ)\n\n\t\tMayor Vincent Gray (Washington, DC)\n\n\t\tMayor Sly James (Kansas City, MO)\n\n\t\tMayor Kevin Johnson (Sacramento, CA)\n\n\t\tMayor Mitch Landrieu (New Orleans, LA)\n\n\t\tMayor Mark Mallory (Cincinnati, OH)\n\n\t\tMayor Michael Nutter (Philadelphia, PA)\n\n\t\tMayor Annise Parker (Houston, TX)\n\n\t\tMayor Jean Quan (Oakland, CA)\n\n\t\tMayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (Baltimore, MD)\n\n\t\tMayor Kasim Reed (Atlanta, GA)\n\n\t\tMayor RT Rybak (Minneapolis, MN)\n\n\t\tMayor Francis Slay (St. Louis, MO)\n\n\t\tMayor Dayne Walling (Flint, MI)\n\n\t\tMayor Molly Ward (Hampton, VA)\n\n\t\tMayor AC Wharton (Memphis, TN)\n\n\n\n\n\n"
