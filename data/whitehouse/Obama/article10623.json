That is the definition of a good compromise.\n\n\tReforming the complex regulations of the alternative minimum tax is a good thing. Extending the tax cuts is a good thing. Reducing the payroll tax is a good thing. And extending unemployment benefits is a good thing. Taken together, they should stimulate the economy by encouraging the creation of new businesses in the near future, and sustain for a while longer those most affected by the current business climate.\n\n\tI strongly applaud the president for making the deal.\n\n\n\n\n"
