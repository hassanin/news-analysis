The boundaries are delineated in the attached map and accompanying table of OCS blocks. Both the map and the table form a part of this memorandum. This withdrawal prevents consideration of this area for any future mineral leasing for purposes of exploration, development, or production.\n\n\tNothing in this withdrawal affects rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas.\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
