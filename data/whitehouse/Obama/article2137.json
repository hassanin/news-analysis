That's why when other countries cut corners and break the rules on trade, my Administration stands up for strong trade enforcement. In fact, since taking office, we've overhauled our trade enforcement efforts and dedicated significant new resources to holding our trading partners accountable.  We've filed more enforcement complaints in the World Trade Organization (WTO) than any other WTO member - and we've won every one of those challenges that's been decided. Today, we're building on our support for American workers and businesses by filing our latest complaint with the WTO against China's trade practices.\n\n\tChina gives its aluminum industry an unfair advantage through underpriced loans and other illegal government subsidies.  These kinds of policies have disadvantaged American manufacturers and contributed to the global glut in aluminum, steel, and other sectors.  We're taking action to protect the workers - at home and around the world - who are hurt every day by these policies. That's what we've done since day one. From enhancing fair trade laws and expanding enforcement resources to preventing unfair currency practices and safeguarding intellectual property, our record of forceful and effective trade enforcement on behalf of American businesses and workers has protected American jobs. It's simple: when the playing field is level, American workers win.\n\n\n\n\n"
