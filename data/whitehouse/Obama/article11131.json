Rhonda benefited from these subsidies after she was laid off from her job.  This tied her over until she went to work for her husband and was covered under his plan. \nInvestments in Local Infrastructure: Joe runs an architecture firm with five employees. He was able to keep two of their employees that otherwise would have been laid off due to work on a police station renovation that received infrastructure funding.  Joe is hopeful that he will hire an additional employee as the economy continues to improve and additional projects, some of which could be funded by the Recovery Act, are secured.\nPre-existing Conditions: With the passage of health care reform, if the Weithman’s shop for new insurance, their son will be able to get health care coverage despite his pre-existing condition.  The new law includes new rules to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage to children under the age of 19 due to a pre-existing condition. \nELECTED OFFICIALS EXPECTED TO ATTEND\nGovernor Ted Strickland\nUS Senator Sherrod Brown\nUS Representative Mary Jo Kilroy\nLieutenant Governor Lee Fisher\nMayor Michael Coleman\n\n\n\n"
