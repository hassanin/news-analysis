We continue to call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide assistance in his case, as agreed to as part of the prisoner exchange finalized earlier this year, so that we can bring Mr. Levinson home.\n\n\tFinding Mr. Levinson remains a top priority for the United States, and we continue to spare no effort to bring him home. Today the United States renews its unrelenting commitment to securing Mr. Levinson's return. Our hearts remain with the Levinson family. They have endured the pain and suffering of his disappearance for far too long.\n\n\n\n\n"
