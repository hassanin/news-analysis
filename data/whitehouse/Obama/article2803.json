The conversation will highlight both the educational barriers girls face as Liberia moves beyond the Ebola epidemic, and the U.S. Government’s efforts to continue to address those barriers and provide adolescent girls with equitable access to safe and quality education.  President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf will join Mrs. Obama during her visit.  The First Lady’s events in Liberia will take place on June 27.\n\n\tIn Morocco, the First Lady—joined by Meryl Streep, also an advocate for girls’ education, and Freida Pinto—will participate in a conversation with adolescent girls moderated by CNN’s Isha Sesay.  In the discussion, participants will discuss the challenges many girls in the region face in getting a quality education.  The First Lady’s visit will also highlight commitments made by the U.S. Government through the Millennium Challenge Corporation and USAID in partnership with the Kingdom of Morocco to help adolescent girls in Morocco go to school and stay in school.  The First Lady will be in Morocco on June 28 and 29. \n\n\tIn Madrid, the First Lady will deliver a speech on Let Girls Learn to girls and young women, sharing the stories of girls she has met in Liberia and Morocco - and her prior travels - and highlighting new commitments to support Let Girls Learn.  Mrs. Obama will encourage the audience to value their own educational opportunities, continue to strive for progress for girls and young women in their country, and take action to help the more than 62 million girls around the world who are out of school.  This event will take place on June 30.  While in Spain, the First Lady will also meet with Her Majesty Queen Letizia. \n\n\n\n\n"
