According to BP, the riser cutting will likely start Monday, or Tuesday.\nThey also discussed the fact that the flow rate could increase as much as 20% until the containment device is applied over the leak.\nAdm. Allen indicated that, as per the President's direction, government and contractor resources in areas affected by oil will be tripled. He also indicated that officials on the ground have increased efforts to be more responsive to needs identified by local communities.”\n\n\n\n"
