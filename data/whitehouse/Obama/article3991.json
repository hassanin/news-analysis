The Summit will focus on how workers can make their voices heard in the workplace in ways that are good for workers and businesses.  The labor movement has long served as a powerful force for ensuring that workers’ voices are heard and, as a result, for growing and strengthening the middle class. As we work to continue to address economic inequality, and as we adapt to the challenges and opportunities presented by our changing workforce, the Summit on Worker Voice will look to energize a new generation of Americans to come together and recognize the potential power of their voice at work. \n\n\tAdditional details about the Summit will be made available in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\n\n"
