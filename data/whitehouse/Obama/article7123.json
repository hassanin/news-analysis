If they don’t, the insurance companies must provide a rebate to their customers. As a result of this provision, 8.5 million consumers nationwide will receive half a billion dollars in rebates this summer, with an average rebate of around $100 per family.  This new standard and other ACA policies together helped consumers save approximately $3.9 billion on premiums in 2012.   \n\n\n\n\n"
