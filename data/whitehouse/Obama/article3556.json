This legislation ensures that, when students fall behind, local educators will take action and invest in what works to help them learn. Finally, the bill makes one of the best investments we can make in our children’s future by providing high-quality preschool to more students. This bipartisan compromise is an important step forward, and we look forward to the Senate’s swift passage of this bill. \n\n\n\n\n"
