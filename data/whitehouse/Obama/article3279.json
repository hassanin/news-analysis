The winners will receive their awards at a Washington, DC ceremony this spring.\n\n\t“These early-career scientists are leading the way in our efforts to confront and understand challenges from climate change to our health and wellness,” President Obama said. “We congratulate these accomplished individuals and encourage them to continue to serve as an example of the incredible promise and ingenuity of the American people.”\n\n\tThe Presidential Early Career Awards highlight the key role that the Administration places in encouraging and accelerating American innovation to grow our economy and tackle our greatest challenges. This year’s recipients are employed or funded by the following departments and agencies: Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of the Interior, Department of Veterans Affairs, Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, and the Intelligence Community. These departments and agencies join together annually to nominate the most meritorious scientists and engineers whose early accomplishments show the greatest promise for assuring America’s preeminence in science and engineering and contributing to the awarding agencies' missions.\n\n\tThe awards, established by President Clinton in 1996, are coordinated by the Office of Science and Technology Policy within the Executive Office of the President. Awardees are selected for their pursuit of innovative research at the frontiers of science and technology and their commitment to community service as demonstrated through scientific leadership, public education, or community outreach.\n\n\tThe newest recipients are*:\n\nDepartment of Agriculture\n\n\tRenee Arias, National Peanut Research Laboratory\n\n\tMatthew Thompson, Rocky Mountain Research Station\n\n\tKenong Xu, Cornell University\n\nDepartment of Commerce\n\n\tNathan Bacheler, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\n\tAdam Creuziger, National Institute of Standards and Technology\n\n\tGijs de Boer, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and University of Colorado-Boulder\n\n\tTara Lovestead, National Institute of Standards and Technology\n\n\tAndrew Ludlow, National Institute of Standards and Technology\n\n\tJames Thorson, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\n\tPieter Abbeel, University of California-Berkeley\n\n\tDeji Akinwande, University of Texas-Austin\n\n\tJin-Hee Cho, US Army Research Laboratory\n\n\tSarah Cowie, University of Nevada-Reno\n\n\tDino Di Carlo, University of California-Los Angeles\n\n\tAlon Gorodetsky, University of California-Irvine\n\n\tElad Harel, Northwestern University\n\n\tPatrick Hopkins, University of Virginia\n\n\tAnya Jones, University of Maryland\n\n\tColin Joye, Naval Research Laboratory\n\n\tLena Kourkoutis, Cornell University\n\n\tJennifer Miksis-Olds, Pennsylvania State University\n\n\tTimothy Ombrello, Air Force Research Laboratory\n\n\tHeather Pidcoke, US Army Institute of Surgical Research\n\n\tJames Rondinelli, Drexel University\n\n\tBozhi Tian, University of Chicago\n\n\tLuke Zettlemoyer, University of Washington\n\nDepartment of Education\n\n\tChristopher Lemons, Peabody College of Vanderbilt University\n\n\tCynthia Puranik, University of Pittsburgh\n\nDepartment of Energy\n\n\tTonio Buonassisi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\tMilind Kulkarni, Purdue University\n\n\tKeji Lai, University of Texas-Austin\n\n\tPaul Ohodnicki, Jr., National Energy Technology Laboratory\n\n\tMichelle O'Malley, University of California, Santa Barbara\n\n\tMatthias Schindler, University of South Carolina\n\n\tJonathan Simon, University of Chicago\n\n\tMichael Stadler, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n\n\tMelissa Teague, Idaho National Laboratory\n\n\tWilliam Tisdale, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\tJonathan Hopkins, University of California, Los Angeles\n\n\tTammy Ma, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\n\n\tDavid Mascareñas, Los Alamos National Laboratory\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\n\n\tHillel Adesnik, University of California, Berkeley\n\n\tCheryl Broussard, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n\tSamantha Brugmann, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center\n\n\tNamandje Bumpus, Johns Hopkins University\n\n\tJacob Carr, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n\tKafui Dzirasa, Duke University\n\n\tCamilla Forsberg, University of California, Santa Cruz\n\n\tTina Goldstein, University of Pittsburgh\n\n\tViviana Gradinaru, California Institute of Technology\n\n\tJordan Green, Johns Hopkins University\n\n\tKatie Kindt, National Institutes of Health\n\n\tAndre Larochelle, National Institutes of Health\n\n\tJennifer Lorvick, RTI International\n\n\tCourtney Miller, The Scripps Research Institute\n\n\tKiran Musunuru, Harvard University\n\n\tDavid Pagliarini, University of Wisconsin – Madison\n\n\tSachin Patel, Vanderbilt University\n\n\tAmy Ralston, University of California Santa Cruz\n\n\tCarrie Reed, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n\tErvin Sejdic, University of Pittsburgh\n\n\tElizabeth Skidmore, University of Pittsburgh\n\n\tKay Tye, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\tMuhammad Walji, The University of Texas School of Dentistry at Houston\n\nDepartment of Interior\n\n\tRichard Briggs, U.S. Geological Survey\n\n\tJeffrey Pigati, U.S. Geological Survey\n\n\tMaureen Purcell, U.S. Geological Survey\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n\n\tPaul Marasco, Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center\n\n\tPanagiotis Roussos, James J.
