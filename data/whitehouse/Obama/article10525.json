The President reiterated that he will not give up on the DREAM Act, and thanked the members for their tireless leadership on this issue.\n\n\tThe President further reiterated his commitment to comprehensive immigration reform, pointing out that we can no longer perpetuate a broken immigration system that is not working for our country or our economy. The President and the members agreed that the American people expect both parties to come together around common sense approaches to solve our toughest problems, not kick them down the road, and agreed to work together and with the Congress to get the job done.  They also agreed that immigration reform should remain a top priority for the coming Congress, and to work together to advance proposals that not only to strengthen security at the nation’s borders, but also restore responsibility and accountability to what everyone agrees is a badly broken immigration system.  \n\nMembers in Attendance:\n\t \n\tSenator Bob Menendez (NJ)\n\tCongressman Xavier Becerra (CA)\n\tCongresswoman Nydia Velazquez (NY)\n\tCongressman Charlie Gonzalez (TX)\n\tCongressman Luis Gutierrez (IL)\n\n\n\n\n"
