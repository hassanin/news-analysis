Also included is an amendment to a Government-wide general provision. These amendments will not increase the overall discretionary budget authority in my FY 2013 Budget.\n\n\tIn addition, this transmittal contains FY 2013 amendments for the Legislative Branch. As a matter of comity and per tradition, these appropriations requests for the Legislative Branch are transmitted without change.\n\n\tThese amendments are necessary to reflect correctly policies assumed in the FY 2013 Budget. The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n\tSincerely,\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
