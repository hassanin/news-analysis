As we learn more in the days ahead about the details of the President's plan, I am confident we will find even more initiatives that will help Minnesota's citizens, businesses, and economy.  I look forward to rolling up my sleeves to support the President's proposals and to put them to work for Minnesota.\"\n\n\n\n\n"
