    "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary\n\n\nFor Immediate Release\nMay 20, 2014\n\n \n\n\n\nMessage to the Senate -- Transmitting a Tax Convention with Poland\n\n\n\n\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES: \nI transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its ratification, the Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of Poland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed on February 13, 2013, at Warsaw (the \"proposed Convention\"). I also transmit for the information of the Senate the report of the Department of State, which includes an overview of the proposed Convention. \nThe proposed Convention replaces the existing Convention, signed in 1974, and was negotiated to bring United States-Poland tax treaty relations into closer conformity with current U.S. tax treaty policies. For example, the proposed Convention contains provisions designed to address \"treaty shopping,\" which is the inappropriate use of a tax treaty by residents of a third country, that the existing Convention does not. Concluding the proposed Convention with Poland has been a top priority for the tax treaty program at the Department of the Treasury. \nI recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the proposed Convention and give its advice and consent to its ratification. \nBARACK OBAMA \n\n\n\n\n"
