Employing millions of Americans and creating nearly two out of three new jobs, America’s small businesses are the backbone of our economy. More than that, our small businesses represent what is best about America – that with hard work and ingenuity, anyone – no matter their background – can build a better future for themselves and their families. \nThat’s why we have cut taxes for small businesses 18 times and we remain committed to simplifying the tax code for small businesses.  Additionally, the Small Business Administration continues to support hundreds of thousands of businesses through loans all across the nation.  But there’s more work to do, and my administration will continue to do everything we can to help our businesses grow and succeed, including taking steps to invest in our infrastructure, support access to credit to more small businesses and reform our immigration system. During National Small Business Week, we renew our commitment to helping our businesses hire more workers, sell more products and continue to grow the foundation of our American economy.\n\n\n\n\n"
