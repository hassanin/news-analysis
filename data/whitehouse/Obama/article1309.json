and\n\n\t(xiv) such other agencies or offices as the Chair may invite to participate.\n\n\t(b)  Functions.  Consistent with the authorities and responsibilities of participating agencies and offices, the Working Group shall support the safe and responsible production of domestic unconventional natural gas by performing the following functions:\n\n\t(i) coordinate agency policy activities, ensuring their efficient and effective operation and facilitating cooperation among agencies, as appropriate;\n\n\t(ii) coordinate among agencies the sharing of scientific, environmental, and related technical and economic information;\n\n\t(iii) engage in long-term planning and ensure coordination among the appropriate Federal entities with respect to such issues as research, natural resource assessment, and the development of infrastructure; \n\t(iv) promote interagency communication with stakeholders; and\n\n\t(v) consult with other agencies and offices as appropriate.\n\nSec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n\t(b)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n\t(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n\t(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n\t(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\t          April 13, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n"
