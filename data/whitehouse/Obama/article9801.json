U.S. Special Envoy Lyman will remain in the region to work with the African Union, United Nations and the parties to urgently address this crisis.   This trip reflects the President's personal commitment to a peaceful resolution of the problems that have beset the region over the last several decades.\n\n\tAs part of our close consultations with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) partners, Mr. Brennan next goes to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for meetings with government officials to discuss options to address the deteriorating situation in Yemen.  We strongly condemn the recent clashes in Sana’a and the deplorable use of violence by the government against peaceful demonstrators in Taiz.  These tragic events underscore the need for President Saleh to sign the GCC-brokered transition proposal and to begin the transfer of power immediately.  That is the best way to avoid further bloodshed and for the Yemeni people to realize their aspirations for peace, reform, and prosperity.\n\n\n\n\n"
