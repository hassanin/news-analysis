FEMA Administrator Fugate will also join the call.\n The President also convened conference calls with state and local elected officials in New Jersey and Connecticut to ensure that federal partners continue to bring all available resources to bear to support state and local response efforts and that bureaucratic red tape is not impeding progress. \n The call with New Jersey officials included Governor Christie, the state’s emergency manager and more than 700 officials from across the state.  The call to discuss Connecticut recovery efforts included Governor Malloy and the state’s emergency manager.   FEMA Administrator Fugate also participated in both calls.\n\n\n\n\n"
