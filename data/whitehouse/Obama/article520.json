Specifically, I have determined that for 2016, across-the-board pay increases will be 1.0 percent. Also, I will make a decision by November 30, 2015, regarding an alternative plan for locality payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304a. The alternative plan for locality payments will be limited so that the total combined cost of the 1.0 percent across-the-board base pay increase and the varying locality pay increases will be 1.3 percent of basic payroll, consistent with the assumption in my 2016 Budget. These decisions will not materially affect our ability to attract and retain a well-qualified Federal workforce.\n\n\tThe adjustments described above shall take effect on the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2016.\n\n\tSincerely,\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
