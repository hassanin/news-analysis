An employee of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Mr. Mannan served the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka with distinction, and he worked on behalf of his fellow Bangladeshis as a voice for justice, equality, and human rights for all.Â  Mr. Mannan set an example of dignity, courage, and selflessness, and his legacy will live on in the causes he championed. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr. Mannan's loved ones as they mourn his loss, and we strongly urge the Government of Bangladesh to ensure that the perpetrators of this senseless crime are brought to justice.\n\n\n\n\n"
