To be sure, his tasks have never been easy—responding to natural disasters, epidemics, and famine, to name just a few examples. But Raj, the son of proud Indian immigrants, has embodied America’s finest values by proactively advancing our development priorities, including ending global poverty, championing food security, promoting health and nutrition, expanding access to energy sources, and supporting political and economic reform in closed societies.\nRaj’s leadership and counsel will be missed, but I join his USAID colleagues and Administration counterparts in wishing him well as he embarks on a new chapter.\n\n\n\n\n"
