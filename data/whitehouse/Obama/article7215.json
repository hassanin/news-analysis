Just last week, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office released its score of the Senate’s bipartisan immigration legislation, providing further evidence that commonsense immigration reform would promote economic growth and reduce the deficit.\nThe President noted that business representatives participating in today’s meeting know first-hand that the broken immigration system is bad for business, for workers and our economy. He also noted that some of the business owners at the table were immigrants, and like the generations of immigrants that came before them, these business leaders came to this country to build a better life and are now helping us build a stronger economy by creating American jobs.\nThe President reiterated his support for the continued bipartisan efforts in Congress and made clear he will continue to urge Congressional leaders to take action in order to grow the economy, strengthen the middle class, improve our fiscal outlook and create new opportunity for Americans everywhere.\nParticipants in the meeting included:\n\n\n\t\tSteve Case, Chairman and CEO, Revolution LLc\n\n\t\tJason Berry, Owner, Blueberry Farms of Georgia and Berry Farms \n\n\t\tFarooq Kathwari, Chairman, President and CEO of Ethan Allen Interiors Inc.\n\n\t\tBricia Lopez, Co-Owner of the Guelaguetza Restaurante\n\nKaren Lozano, Founder and Chief Technology Officer, FibeRio Technology \n\n\t\tSunil Puri, Founder, First Rockford Group\n\n\t\tDilawar Syed, CEO Yonja Media Group\n\n\t\tAlex Torrenegra, Founder, VoiceBunny and WeHostels\n\n\t\tHamdi Ulukaya, CEO, Founder and President, Chobani\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n"
