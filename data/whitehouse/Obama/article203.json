Therefore, I am continuing in effect for an additional year the national emergency that was declared on September 14, 2001, with respect to the terrorist threat.\n\tThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\n\n\t \n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\t \n\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tAugust 30, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n"
