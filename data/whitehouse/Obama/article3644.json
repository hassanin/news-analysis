Mission in Liberia in July 2016 and presidential elections in 2017.  Liberia and its people are up to these challenges, and the United States and our international partners will remain steadfast in our commitment to Liberia.  Today's announcement is one of what will surely be many more steps as Liberia continues to take charge of its future and live up to its full potential.\n\n\n\n\n"
