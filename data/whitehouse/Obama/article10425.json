During the historic Nuclear Security Summit in Washington in April of 2010, Chinese President Hu Jintao agreed to establish a “Center of Excellence” on nuclear security to help support the global effort to secure vulnerable nuclear material around the world. This agreement paves the way for DOE’s National Nuclear Security Administration and the Department of Defense to work with our partners in China to develop a center that will provide a central site for training in all aspects of nuclear security. It will serve as a forum for exchanging technical information, sharing best practices, developing training courses, and promoting technical collaborations that will enhance nuclear security in China and throughout Asia. It will also help meet the training needs for China’s expanding nuclear sector and promote nuclear security best practices throughout the region.  \n\tFor more information view the attached fact sheet and click HERE.\n\t \nCooperation on Climate Change, Clean Energy and the Environment\n\t \n\tPresident Obama and President Hu applauded efforts to implement the provisions of the Cancun agreements that build on the Copenhagen Accord; welcomed enhanced cooperation on clean energy and announced joint work plans for the newly established research consortia under the U.S.-China Clean Energy Research Center in building efficiency, clean coal, and clean vehicles; signed an agreement with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to promote cooperation in a range of energy, biological, and environmental sciences; started negotiations on a U.S.-China Eco-City Initiative to integrate energy efficiency and renewable energy into city design and operation in our two countries; signed a statement of intent to share data on electric vehicle demonstrations in Los Angeles and Shanghai; and announced two new EcoPartnerships on energy efficiency and clean electricity.  \n\tFor more information view the attached fact sheet and click HERE.\n\t \nScience and Technology Cooperation\n\t \n\tThe United States and China extended the U.S.-China Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology,  one of the longest standing agreements between our two countries.  Since it was first signed in 1979, the agreement has fostered exchanges to advance cooperative research in a diverse array of fields, including fisheries, earth and atmospheric sciences, basic research in physics and chemistry, a variety of energy-related areas, agriculture, civil industrial technology, geology, health, and disaster research.\n\tFor more information view the attached fact sheet.\n\t \nEducation\n\t \n\tFirst Lady Michelle Obama hosted an event at Howard University to highlight educational exchanges between our two countries and announce progress on the 100,000 Strong Initiative.  President Obama launched the initiative in November 2009 to reach the goal of encouraging 100,000 American students to study in China.\n\tFor more information click HERE.\n\t \nHealth\n\t \n\tTo promote collaboration between our two countries on health issues, the United States and China announced their intention to establish a public private partnership on healthcare.
