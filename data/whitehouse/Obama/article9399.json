Therefore, I hope both parties will put politics and partisanship aside, and work together to ensure the success of the next generation of great American companies.  I look forward to continuing to work with the President’s Jobs Council to ensure that smart entrepreneurship policies continue to be a major focus of job creation efforts in Washington, and with the Startup America Partnership to ensure that the private sector does its part to celebrate and support our nation's entrepreneurs.”\n\n\n\n\n"
