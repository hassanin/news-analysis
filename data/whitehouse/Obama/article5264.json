They allow us to rise above differences by maintaining the long-term perspective.  Every day, in myriad ways, our cooperation fortifies a relationship that matches the innumerable ties between our peoples, who have produced works of art and music, invented cutting-edge technology, and responded to crises across the globe.\nOur strategic partnership is a joint endeavor for prosperity and peace. Through intense consultations, joint exercises, and shared technology, our security cooperation will make the region and the world safe and secure.  Together, we will combat terrorist threats and keep our homelands and citizens safe from attacks, while we respond expeditiously to humanitarian disasters and crises.  We will prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and remain committed to reducing the salience of nuclear weapons, while promoting universal, verifiable, and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament.\nWe will support an open and inclusive rules-based global order, in which India assumes greater multilateral responsibility, including in a reformed United Nations Security Council.  At the United Nations and beyond, our close coordination will lead to a more secure and just world.\nClimate change threatens both our countries, and we will join together to mitigate its impact and adapt to our changing environment.  We will address the consequences of unchecked pollution through cooperation by our governments, science and academic communities. We will partner to ensure that both countries have affordable, clean, reliable, and diverse sources of energy, including through our efforts to bring American-origin nuclear power technologies to India.   \nWe will ensure that economic growth in both countries brings better livelihoods and welfare for all of our people.  Our citizens value education as a means to a better life, and our exchange of skills and knowledge will propel our countries forward.  Even the poorest will share in the opportunities in both our countries. \nJoint research and collaboration in every aspect—ranging from particles of creation to outer space -- will produce boundless innovation and high technology collaboration that changes our lives.  Open markets, fair and transparent practices will allow trade in goods and services to flourish.\nOur people will be healthier as we jointly counter infectious diseases, eliminate maternal and child deaths, and work to eradicate poverty for all.   And they will be safer as we ensure the fullest empowerment of women in a secure environment.\nThe United States and India commit to expand and deepen our strategic partnership in order to harness the inherent potential of our two democracies and the burgeoning ties between our people, economies, and businesses.  Together we seek a reliable and enduring friendship that bolsters security and stability, contributes to the global economy, and advances peace and prosperity for our citizens and throughout the world. \nWe have a vision that the United States and India will have a transformative relationship as trusted partners in the 21st century.  Our partnership will be a model for the rest of the world.\n\n\n\n\n"
