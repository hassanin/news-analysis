The President’s Fiscal Year 2013 budget includes $677 million, an increase of $49 million over FY 2012, within the Health Resources and Services Administration to expand the capacity and improve the training and distribution of primary care, dental, and pediatric health providers. The Budget will support the placement of more than 1,500 new primary care providers in underserved areas and begin investments that expand the capacity of institutions to train 2,800 additional primary care providers over five years.\n\nTraining Physicians in Community-Based Settings: The Affordable Care Act created the Teaching Health Center Program to help move primary care training into community-based settings. The five-year investment in this program is expected to supportthe community-based training of over 600 new primary care physician residents by 2015. \n\nSupporting Mental Health Training: Mental health issues rank in the top five chronic illnesses in the United States. In Fiscal Year 2012, the Affordable Care Act will invest $10 million to support training to help close the gap in access to mental and behavioral health care services by increasing the number of adequately prepared mental and behavioral health providers.\n\nExpanding Residency Slots for Primary Care: To encourage more medical residents to pursue careers in primary care, the Affordable Care Act redistributes unused residency positions and directs those slots for the training of primary care physicians. In distributing the residency slots, priority for awarding residents is given to hospitals that have rural training tracks, train residents in geriatrics, use the additional slots to create or expand a primary care program, demonstrate focus in training residents to pursue careers in primary care, or are located in a primary care health professional shortage area.\n\nExpanding Training of Advanced Practice Nurses: The Affordable Care Act allows up to five hospitals to receive $50 million each year, for fiscal years 2012 to 2015, to train advanced practice nurses, including nurses in community-based settings through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \n\n\nModernizing Primary Care Training and Practice\n\n\tImplementation of the Affordable Care Act provisions is strengthening the primary care training infrastructure, creating new primary care clinical training opportunities, and supporting primary care practice. These efforts include:\n\n\nEncouraging Physician Training in the Community: The Affordable Care Act provides incentives for hospitals to train primary care physicians in the community by providing flexibility in Medicare residency training requirements. Prior to the law, hospitals had to bear the cost of education in non-hospital sites, often by paying both the resident’s and teaching physician’s salary. This requirement discouraged training in community settings, which encourages primary care practice. The Affordable Care Act changed this policy and requires hospitals to only pay the resident salaries.\n\nEncouraging Health Homes:  Under the Affordable Care Act, States are incentivized to create Medicaid “health homes” for individuals with chronic health conditions. Health homes encourage the use of primary care providers to provide integrated care to help patients better manage their health. States that create health homes will receive enhanced federal matching funds for care coordination services for the first eight quarters a health home state plan amendment is in effect.\n\n\nModernizing Payment and Improving Financial Incentives for Coordinated Care\n\n\nCreating Primary Care Payment Incentives:  The Affordable Care Act authorizes a ten percent Medicare payment bonus from 2011 to 2015 for physicians who specialize in family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, or physician assistants for whom primary care services account for at least 60 percent of their Medicare allowed charges. The Affordable Care Act also increases primary care physician payment rates in the Medicaid program to match Medicare payment levels in 2013 and 2014. \n\nRealigning financial incentives in Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs):Under old payment systems, care coordination – the hallmark of effective primary care – wasn’t rewarded financially. Medicare’s shared savings program changes that model by rewarding physicians and other primary care practitioners for high-quality care and preventing the need for care in the first place. Already, 27 ACOs have joined the program and over 150 more potential ACOs have submitted an application. CMS has also created two demonstration programs to supplement the shared savings program: the Pioneer ACO initiative for 32 large and experienced health systems ready to move into accountable care quickly; and the Advanced Payment ACO, for smaller practices that need help with startup costs. Together, these initiatives are improving primary care for 1.1 million people with Medicare.\n\nInnovation Center: The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation has launched 16 initiatives involving over 50,000 health care providers that will touch the lives of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in all 50 States. Many of those are explicitly designed to promote primary care.\n\t\t\n\nComprehensive Primary Care Initiative Demonstration: A public-private partnership to enhance access to primary care services by establishing medical homes supported by multiple payers. Funding of up to $322 million is available to support 75 practices in 5-7 States starting this year.\n\nFederal Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Advanced Primary Care Practice Demonstration: This initiative makes almost $50 million available to support 500 FQHCs in 44 States with care coordination payments that will allow the Centers to become medical homes, the hub of a patient’s primary care needs. This initiative started in 2011.\n\nMulti-payer Advanced Primary Care Practice Demonstration: This initiative, launched in 2011, is a State-led, multi-payer collaboration to help primary care practices transform into medical homes. It makes $283 million available in 8 States.\n\nIndependence at Home: This initiative supports home-based care for patients with multiple chronic conditions that would benefit from primary care coordination. It provides up to $15 million to support up to 50 practices and will launch later this year.\n\n\n\n\n\t  \n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
