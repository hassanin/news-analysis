We call for the release of all government leaders and urge all parties to reconcile their differences through the democratic process.\nWe welcome the strong statement by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) condemning this unconstitutional seizure of power, and we applaud ECOWAS’s consistent efforts to reinforce constitutional rule.  We also welcome the United Nations Security Council’s attention to the situation in Guinea Bissau and its swift condemnation of the events there.\n\n\n\n\n"
