In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in Executive Order 12170 of November 14, 1979, is to continue in effect beyond November 14, 2016.\n\n\tOur relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the process of implementing the agreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is still under way. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 with respect to Iran.\n\n\tSincerely,\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
