The Council has achieved significant progress over the past year, including:\n\n\n\t\tPilot projects for simultaneous submissions to regulators in both countries for approval of crop protection products;\n\n\n\n\t\tIn the area of veterinary drugs, simultaneous reviews by U.S. and Canadian regulators for several drug submissions; \n\n\n\n\t\tA pilot project for the joint inspection of non-U.S. and non-Canadian flagged vessels entering the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway, focusing on maritime security and pollution prevention, and monitoring living and working conditions for workers on these ships; and\n\n\n\n\t\tA proposal to align U.S. and Canadian rules on tire safety and occupant restraint systems in frontal impact collisions.\n\nFor more than forty years, the increasing integration of the economies of the United States and Canada has been key to our two countries’ prosperity and security.  We intend to continue to work together under these initiatives through 2013, 2014, and beyond to reduce and eliminate barriers to trade and investment, securing our shared competitiveness for the 21st century.\n\n\n\n\n"
