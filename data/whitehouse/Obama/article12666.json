These bombings serve no purpose other than the murder of innocent men, women and children, and they only reveal the hateful and destructive agenda of those who would deny the Iraqi people the future that they deserve.  These attempts to derail Iraq's progress are no match for the courage and resilience of the Iraqi people, and their determination to build strong institutions. The United States will stand with Iraq's people and government as a close friend and partner as Iraqis prepare for elections early next year, continue to take responsibility for their future, and build greater peace and opportunity. Together, we will continue to work for lasting security, dignity, and justice.\nBACKGROUND: The President spoke with President Talabani and Prime Minister al-Maliki at about 1:00 PM EST.  He expressed condolences about the attacks and reiterated our commitment to stand with Iraqis.\n\n\n\n\n"
