Sperling, Director of the National Economic Council, on Trade Adjustment Assistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWe are disappointed that some in Congress have blocked renewing key elements of Trade Adjustment Assistance.  As a result of this inaction, 155,000 Americans will lose access to the job training they need to provide for their families and compete in the global economy. \n\n\tAs our businesses and workers are rebuilding our economy after a historic recession, now is not the time to turn our backs on those who are trying hard to be part of a 21st century American workforce.  Congress should keep faith with America’s workers and extend this vital assistance.\n\n\n\n\n"
