But still, in communities across the country, 10.5 million people eligible for Marketplace coverage remain uninsured.\n\n\tToday, we are launching the White House “Healthy Communities Challenge” to engage key communities with large numbers or high percentages of uninsured in states across the country where strong federal, state and community collaboration can have a meaningful impact on reaching the uninsured. Through this challenge, we are calling on community leadership to build outreach efforts to reach these remaining uninsured and help them gain coverage. \n\n\tAt the end of this third open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), along with State-based Marketplaces, will publish tallies of new Marketplace signups in participating communities. These tallies will be compared to HHS estimates of the number of eligible uninsured people at the start of open enrollment to see which communities made the most progress during the challenge. \n\n\tThe victorious community gets bragging rights, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success in helping ensure every American has health coverage.\n\n\tBased on particularly high opportunity for impact, the White House reached out to local officials in each of these 20 communities, including Mayor Sly James, who embraced the “Healthy Communities Challenge” to get their uninsured constituents covered.\n\nKansas City Health Insurance Marketplace for 2016\n\n\nHealth insurance coverage is affordable.  On June 30, 2015, 212,256 people in Missouri were covered through its Health Insurance Exchange, or Marketplace.  \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Missouri, 79 percent of people can find a plan for $100 or less, 74 percent for $75 or less, and 68 percent for $50 or less for 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\tTax credits matter. In 2015, 89 percent of Marketplace enrollees – 188,352 people – in Missouri received a tax credit, and consumers saved an average of $278 per month.\n\n\n\nConsumers have a choice. \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Missouri, 7 issuers are offering individual health plans in the Marketplace in 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\tIssuers are offering an average of 37 plans per county in Missouri in 2016.\n\n\n\nIt pays to shop. \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Missouri, 86 percent of Marketplace consumers who switch to the lowest-cost plan within a coverage level could save on average $42 per month, or $502 per year, on their premium costs in 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\tAbout 34 percent of 2014 enrollees in Missouri switched to a new plan in 2015, saving $395 per year – and $9,425,376 in total statewide – on premium costs.\n\n\n\nWhile progress has been made, more work is needed to cover the uninsured.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Missouri, the adult uninsured rate dropped from 15.2 percent in 2013 to 11.4 percent in the first half of 2015.\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Kansas City and the surrounding region, there are 112,000 uninsured who are eligible for the Marketplace. (The number of the uninsured is for the Designated Market Area that includes Kansas City.)\n\n\n\n\nCommunities Participating in the “Healthy Communities Challenge”\n\n\n\t\t         Dallas, TX\n\n\t\t         Tampa, FL\n\n\t\t         Atlanta, GA\n\n\t\t         Seattle, WA\n\n\t\t         Great Falls, MT\n\n\t\t         Salt Lake City, UT\n\n\t\t         Kansas City, MO\n\n\t\t         Chicago, IL\n\n\t\t         Phoenix, AZ\n\n\t\t         Detroit, MI\n\n\t\t         Charlotte, NC\n\n\t\t         Nashville, TN\n\n\t\t         New Orleans, LA\n\n\t\t         Denver, CO\n\n\t\t         Milwaukee, WI\n\n\t\t         Philadelphia, PA\n\n\t\t         Las Vegas, NV\n\n\t\t         Oakland, CA\n\n\t\t         Richmond, VA\n\n\t\t         Long Beach, CA\n\n\n\n\n\n"
