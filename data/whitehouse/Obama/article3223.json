She was right, of course. But we had a head start, because we were fortunate to benefit from her proud example, and her warm and generous advice.\n\n\tOur former First Lady redefined the role in her time here. Later, in her long goodbye with President Reagan, she became a voice on behalf of millions of families going through the depleting, aching reality of Alzheimerâ€™s, and took on a new role, as advocate, on behalf of treatments that hold the potential and the promise to improve and save lives.\n\n\tWe offer our sincere condolences to their children, Patti, Ron, and Michael, and to their grandchildren. And we remain grateful for Nancy Reagan's life, thankful for her guidance, and prayerful that she and her beloved husband are together again.\n\n\t###\n\n\n\n\n"
