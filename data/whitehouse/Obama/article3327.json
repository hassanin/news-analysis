Rice on the North Korean Missile Launch\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNorth Korea's launch using ballistic missile technology, following so closely after its January 6 nuclear test, represents yet another destabilizing and provocative action and is a flagrant violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions.  North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons programs represent serious threats to our interests--including the security of some of our closest allies--and undermine peace and security in the broader region.  ‎ ‎ \n\t \n\tWe condemn today's launch and North Korea's determination to prioritize its missile and nuclear weapons programs over the well-being of its people, whose struggles only intensify with North Korea’s diversion of scarce resources to such destabilizing activities.   ‎ \n\t \n\tThe United States is fully committed to the security of our allies in the region, and we will take all necessary steps to defend ourselves and our allies and respond to North Korean provocations. We call upon the international community to stand together and demonstrate to North Korea that its reckless actions must have serious consequences.  \n\t \n\t###\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
