Those are the principal drivers of today’s deficits, and we’d be foolish to do more of the same and expect a different outcome.\n\n\t \n\n\tWe all share the common goal of putting America back on track by reducing the deficits with a balanced approach. It’s time for House Republicans to stop ignoring the policies of the past that drove our country into this mess. Put everything on the table and start making the hard choices to get us out.”\n\n\n\n\n"
