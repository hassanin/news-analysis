As Lebanon prepares for parliamentary elections, the United States will continue to support Lebanon’s sovereignty and independence, the legitimate institutions of the Lebanese state, and the Lebanese people.  The United States remains committed to the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1701 and 1559.  We also will continue to support the voices of peace and moderation in Lebanon, and hope that Lebanon continues down the path of national reconciliation, peace, and prosperity that its citizens so strongly deserve. \n\n\n\n"
