This achievement was won only by the extraordinary sacrifices made by many people, including Americans and Russians, and those sacrifices will be honored by the presence of troops from the many nations that came together to defend our common security and human dignity in an hour of maximum peril. In marking this occasion, President Medvedev has shown remarkable leadership in honoring the sacrifices of those who came before us, and in speaking so candidly about the Soviet Union’s suppression of ‘elementary rights and freedoms.’ His words remind us that we must all work together on behalf of a world in which the fundamental human rights that all people deserve are protected.\n\n\n\n"
