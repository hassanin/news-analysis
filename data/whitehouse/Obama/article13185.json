The President subsequently amended that order in Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003.   Because the actions of persons threatening the peace and international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and the measures adopted on that date and thereafter to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2009. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans.   This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.   BARACK OBAMA   THE WHITE HOUSE,  June 22, 2009.    \n\n\n\n"
