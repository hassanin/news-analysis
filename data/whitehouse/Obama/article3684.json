The nation’s uninsured rate now stands at its lowest level ever. But still, in communities across the country, 10.5 million people eligible for Marketplace coverage remain uninsured.\n\n\tToday, we are launching the White House “Healthy Communities Challenge” to engage key communities with large numbers or high percentages of uninsured in states across the country where strong federal, state and community collaboration can have a meaningful impact on reaching the uninsured. Through this challenge, we are calling on community leadership to build outreach efforts to reach these remaining uninsured and help them gain coverage. \n\n\tAt the end of this third open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), along with State-based Marketplaces, will publish tallies of new Marketplace signups in participating communities. These tallies will be compared to HHS estimates of the number of eligible uninsured people at the start of open enrollment to see which communities made the most progress during the challenge. \n\n\tThe victorious community gets bragging rights, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success in helping ensure every American has health coverage.\n\n\tBased on particularly high opportunity for impact, the White House reached out to local officials in each of these 20 communities, including County Judge Clay Jenkins and Mayor Mike Rawlings, who embraced the “Healthy Communities Challenge” to get their uninsured constituents covered.\n\nDallas Health Insurance Marketplace for 2016\n\n\nHealth insurance coverage is affordable.  On June 30, 2015, 943,218 people in Texas were covered through its Health Insurance Exchange, or Marketplace. \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Texas, 79 percent of people can find a plan for $100 or less, 73 percent for $75 or less, and 66 percent for $50 or less for 2016. \n\n\t\t\t\tThe average monthly premium in Dallas for the second-lowest cost silver plans will decrease by 6 percent from 2015 to 2016 before tax credits.\nTax credits matter.  In 2015, 85 percent of Marketplace enrollees – 804,918 people – in Texas received a tax credit, and consumers saved an average of $244 per month.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumers have a choice. \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tIn Texas, 17 issuers are offering individual health plans in the Marketplace in 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\tIssuers are offering an average of 50 plans per county in Texas in 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Dallas, 8 issuers are offering individual health plans in the Marketplace in 2016.\n\n\n\nIt pays to shop. \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Texas, 93 percent of Marketplace consumers who switch to the lowest-cost plan within a coverage level could save on average $53 per month, or $637 per year, on their premium costs in 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\tAbout 29 percent of 2014 enrollees in Texas switched to a new plan in 2015, saving $276 per year – and $27,763,159 in total statewide – on premium costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile progress has been made, more work is needed to cover the uninsured.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Texas, the adult uninsured rate dropped from 27 percent in 2013 to 20.8 percent in the first half of 2015. \n\n\t\t\t\tIn Dallas and the surrounding region, there are 446,000 uninsured who are eligible for the Marketplace.\n(The number of the uninsured is for the Designated Market Area that includes Dallas.)\n\n\n\n\nCommunities Participating in the “Healthy Communities Challenge”\n\n\n\t\t         Dallas, TX\n\n\t\t         Tampa, FL\n\n\t\t         Atlanta, GA\n\n\t\t         Seattle, WA\n\n\t\t         Great Falls, MT\n\n\t\t         Salt Lake City, UT\n\n\t\t         Kansas City, MO\n\n\t\t         Chicago, IL\n\n\t\t         Phoenix, AZ\n\n\t\t         Detroit, MI\n\n\t\t         Charlotte, NC\n\n\t\t         Nashville, TN\n\n\t\t         New Orleans, LA\n\n\t\t         Denver, CO\n\n\t\t         Milwaukee, WI\n\n\t\t         Philadelphia, PA\n\n\t\t         Las Vegas, NV\n\n\t\t         Oakland, CA\n\n\t\t         Richmond, VA\n\n\t\t         Long Beach, CA\n\n\n\t# # #\n\n\n\n\n"
