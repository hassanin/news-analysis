And he has been a constant advocate to ensure that seniors in Wisconsin and across the country have access to affordable prescription drugs.  \n\n\tMichelle and I extend our thanks to Senator Kohl for his years of service to our nation and offer our best wishes for the future to him and his family.\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
