Rice on the Five-Year Anniversary of the New START Treaty Entry into Force\n\n\n\n\n\nFive years ago, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) entered into force.  This historic agreement limits both the United States and Russia to no more than 1,550 deployed warheads and caps both sides at no more than 700 deployed delivery vehicles. These limits will take effect in February 2018.  This verifiable and stabilizing agreement provides critical transparency into Russia’s nuclear capabilities.  It provides predictability in the management of the nuclear forces of both countries, which make up 90 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons.  We look forward to full implementation of the Treaty and continue to call on Russia to answer the President’s invitation five years ago to begin talks on further reductions to our nuclear arsenals.\n\nThe United States and our allies are more secure given the mutual predictability that the New START Treaty provides with Russia.  At the same time, the United States remains committed to reducing the numbers of nuclear weapons in the world and the role they play in our security.  We will also continue to maintain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent for ourselves and our allies as long as nuclear weapons exist.  \n\n\n\n\n"
