In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Burma that was declared on May 20, 1997, is to continue in effect beyond May 20, 2014.\nThe Government of Burma has made significant progress in a number of critical areas, including the release of over 1,100 political prisoners, progress towards a nationwide ceasefire, the legalization of unions, taking steps to improve the country's labor standards, and allowing greater freedom of association and expression. In addition, Burma signed an Additional Protocol to its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a significant step towards supporting the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.\nDespite great strides that Burma has made in its reform effort, the situation in the country continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The political opening remains nascent, and concerns persist regarding ongoing conflict and human rights abuses in ethnic minority areas, particularly in Rakhine State, and the continued role of the military in the country's political and economic activities. Nonetheless, the United States is committed to supporting and strengthening Burma's reform efforts to ensure that the democratic transition is sustained and irreversible. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to Burma.\nSincerely,\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
