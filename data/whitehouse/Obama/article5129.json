They discussed implementation of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act—which includes the most sweeping set of financial regulatory reforms since the Great Depression and the strongest consumer protections in history that have afforded millions of hard-working Americans new rights and protections within the financial sector. They also discussed the near and long-term growth outlook, both in the United States and globally.\n\n\n\n"
