These two new positions, and related changes to take effect on December 1 as a result of the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty, will strengthen the EU and enable it to be an even stronger partner to the United States.  We look forward to working closely with President Van Rompuy and High Representative Ashton, as well as Commission President Barroso and his new cabinet of Commissioners, to fulfill the commitments made at the U.S.-EU Summit on November 3, 2009 to address bilateral, regional and global challenges together.\n\n\n\n"
