We urge the governments of these countries to show restraint, and to respect the universal rights of their people. We urge the government of Bahrain to pursue a peaceful and meaningful dialogue with the opposition rather than resorting to the use of force. In particular, we urge our GCC partners to show restraint and respect the rights of the people of Bahrain, and to act in a way that supports dialogue instead of undermining it.\n\n\n\n\n"
