Today, I'm proud to see that Congress has passed S. 1252, The Global Food Security Act of 2016, an overwhelmingly bipartisan piece of legislation that will put Feed the Future, our global hunger and food security initiative, into law.Â \n\n\tI want to thank the co-sponsors of the legislation, Senators Isakson and Casey and Representatives Smith and McCollum, for their steadfast commitment to strengthening global food security, and also recognize the leaders of the Foreign Affairs and Agriculture Committees for their extraordinary leadership to ensure that these efforts are enduring.\n\n\tThis game-changing development initiative - the first of my Administration - has helped increase economic growth and stem the tide of global hunger, poverty and malnutrition over the span of just a few years. While we've already accomplished so much through this collaborative global partnership, I know that with the continued effort and support that this legislation provides, we can achieve what was just a few years ago the unimaginable: We can end global poverty and hunger within our lifetimes\n\n\n\n\n"
