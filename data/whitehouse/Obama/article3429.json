They agreed that Central America’s prosperity and security, as well as its opportunities and challenges, are inextricably linked and have a direct impact on the rest of the hemisphere.  The leaders also pledged to work cooperatively to stem the flow of undocumented migration from Central America to the United States, especially with regard to unaccompanied minors and families who face significant risk in making this dangerous journey.  \n\n\n\n\n"
