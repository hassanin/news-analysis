That is why I have signed a memorandum to create the Task Force on Middle-Class Working Families – and why I have asked my Vice President to lead it. This is a difficult moment. But I believe, if we act boldly and swiftly, it can be an American moment - when we work through our differences and overcome our divisions to face this crisis.\"\nVice President Biden said:  \"America’s middle class is hurting. Trillions of dollars in home equity and retirement savings and college savings are gone.  And every day, more and more Americans are losing their jobs.  President Obama and I are determined to change this. Quite simply, a strong middle class equals a strong America. We can’t have one without the other.  This Task Force will be an important vehicle to assess new and existing policies across the board and determine if they are helping or hurting the middle class.  It is our charge to get the middle class – the backbone of this country – up and running again.\"\nThe Vice President and members of the task force will work with a wide array of federal agencies that have responsibility for key issues facing middle class and working families, and expedite administrative reforms, propose Executive orders, and develop legislative and policy proposals that can be of special importance to working families.\nThe White House unveiled today the initial version of the Task Force’s new website:  www.AStrongMiddleClass.gov.  Transparency is a key priority for the taskforce and any materials from meetings or reports produced will be made available to the public and on the website.  The website will be updated with additional content as the Task Force gets underway.\nPresident Obama has set the following goals for the task force:\n\nExpanding education and lifelong training opportunities\nImproving work and family balance\nRestoring labor standards, including workplace safety\nHelping to protect middle-class and working-family incomes\nProtecting retirement security\n\nMembers of the White House Task Force on Middle Class Working Families will include the Secretaries of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Commerce, as well as the Directors of the National Economic Council, the Office of Management and Budget, the Domestic Policy Council, and the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors.\nThe Middle Class Task Force’s first official meeting will be on February 27, 2009 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The topic of the first meeting will be:  \"Green Jobs:  A Pathway to a Strong Middle Class.\" \n\n\n\n\n"
