President Obama's speech clearly demonstrates that he is a national leader that will not rest until the work is done. We need to put  Americans back to work and the President has a plan to create jobs by fixing roads, bridges, building schools and constructing the critical infrastructure our nation desperately needs and I support him.  I stand ready to work with the President and my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to once again make America the greatest nation in the world,\" said Senator Daniel K. Inouye.\n\n\n\n\n"
