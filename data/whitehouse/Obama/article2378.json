These cowardly attacks, which killed at least 32 people and wounded more than 80, targeted Shia civilians preparing for the Ashura holy day of mourning and were clearly designed to stoke sectarian tension in Afghanistan. We commend the Afghan police and other security forces who bravely responded to these attacks and fully support efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. The United States stands with the people and Government of Afghanistan as we work together to build a more secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n"
