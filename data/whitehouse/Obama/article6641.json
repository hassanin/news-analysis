This is a significant first as the UAE serves not only as the region's business hub but also as a global crossroads for a larger region including Africa and Asia, and it underscores the UAE’s unique role as a leader in innovation and entrepreneurship.\nThe UAE remains an important trade and investment partner to the United States, and we welcomed the November 17th announcement of major civilian aircraft agreements between airlines in the UAE and Boeing. These agreements, which will create jobs in the United States, symbolize our growing commercial relationship, and we look forward to continued growth with the UAE in all areas of our partnership. \n\n\n\n\n"
