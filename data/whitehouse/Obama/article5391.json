The Vice President congratulated Prime Minister Tusk on his election as the President of the European Council, and discussed our shared agenda for strengthening U.S.-EU ties by completing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) and working together to bolster economic growth and energy security in Europe, among other matters. The Vice President and Prime Minister agreed that further consequences needed to be imposed on Russia for its blatant escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. The two leaders also committed to continued close coordination on the crisis in Ukraine and its broader implications for European security, including at the NATO summit in Wales. \n\n\n\n\n"
