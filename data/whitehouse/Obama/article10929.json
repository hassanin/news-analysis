Human Rights Council\n\n\n\n\nThe United States welcomes the adoption today by the United Nations Human Rights Council of a resolution addressing the elimination of discrimination against women.  Most significantly, this resolution establishes a working group of five independent experts from different regions of the world who will work with governments and civil society to identify and promote steps to eliminate laws and practices that discriminate against women, and to advise governments on how to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women.  The United States was proud to co-sponsor this resolution with a group of over 70 other countries, which was led by Colombia and Mexico.  We look forward to working closely with the new working group and the international community in seeking an end to discrimination against all women everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n"
