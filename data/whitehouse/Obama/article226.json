Such actions contribute to political and economic instability in that country and the region.\n\n\tCertain ongoing activities, such as continuing arms transfers to Hizballah that include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems, serve to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to political and economic instability in Lebanon, and continue to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on August 1, 2007, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond August 1, 2016. In accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Lebanon declared in Executive Order 13441.\n\n\tThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\n\n\t \n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\t \n\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tJuly 27, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n"
