And, even as the new state education aid we secured this summer begins to kick in, the Recovery Act continues to support hundreds of thousands of education jobs across the country.”\n\t \n\t“A record number of recipients filed reports this quarter, providing the American people with the most detailed look yet at some of the ways the Recovery Act is creating jobs in their community.  Because these reports provide real-time data directly from the recipients themselves, they are not perfect or complete - but, in keeping with our commitment to transparency and accountability, they offer the public an unprecedented view of the Recovery Act as it’s put to work.”\n\n\tTo learn more about these reports, click HERE.\n\n\n\n\n"
