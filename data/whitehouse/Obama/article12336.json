On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the President modified the Annex to Executive Order 12947 to identify four additional persons, including Usama bin Laden, who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process.\nBecause these terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East peace process and to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures adopted on that date and on August 20, 1998, to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond January 23, 2010. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process.\nThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\nBARACK OBAMA\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2010.\n\n\n\n"
