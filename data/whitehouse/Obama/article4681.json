Rice’s Meeting with State Councilor Yang Jiechi of China\n\n\n\n\nNational Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met today with State Councilor Yang Jiechi of China in New York City.  Ambassador Rice and State Councilor Yang agreed to strengthen coordination on regional and global challenges, including North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan, global health security, and counterterrorism.  They reaffirmed their commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and agreed that North Korea would not succeed in its twin pursuit of nuclear weapons and economic development.  They also agreed that Iran should seize the historic opportunity presented by the ongoing P5+1 negotiations to address the international community’s concerns regarding its nuclear program. In discussing preparations for President Xi’s state visit to the United States in 2015, Ambassador Rice underscored the importance of expanding tangible cooperation on shared interests—noting the historic joint climate announcement made last year—while addressing areas of disagreement, including cyber issues.\n\n\n\n\n"
