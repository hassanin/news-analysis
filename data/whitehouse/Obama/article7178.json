and, \n\n\t\tAdvancing the “Doing Business in Africa” campaign to encourage U.S. businesses to take advantage of growing trade and investment opportunities and to promote trade missions, reverse trade missions, trade shows, and business-to-business matchmaking in key sectors. \n\nSupport EAC Regional Integration\nThe United States is also supporting the EAC’s efforts to advance regional integration, through bilateral and regional trade facilitation and a new partnership with TradeMark East Africa, with specific focus on:\n\n\n\t\tReducing barriers at borders, including by moving to single border crossings and implementing customs modernization programs using innovative technologies that allow customs services to communicate with each other; \n\n\t\tSupporting the transition to a single EAC customs and revenue sharing authority; and, \n\n\t\tAddressing barriers to transit that constrain the region’s competitiveness, including by reducing the number of roadblocks and the amount of time spent and fees paid to move products from the ports to neighboring borders.   \n\nIncrease EAC Trade Competitiveness\nThe United States will also form public-private partnerships with East African and U.S. industries and trade associations to stimulate greater trade in goods under the African Growth and Opportunity Act and, specifically, to:\n\n\n\t\tBuild the capacity of private sector associations in Africa to provide sustainable business services and promote investment in key growth sectors in Africa, including agriculture, health, clean energy, environment and trade-related infrastructure; \n\n\t\tFormalize partnerships between American and African associations to increase trade through collaboration on trade shows and business-to-business matchmaking; \n\nWork with governments and National Export Associations to develop export strategies and establish export resource centers across the EAC to provide sustainable services for firms looking to export under AGOA.\n\n\n\n\n"
