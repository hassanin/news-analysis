For 18 years, Bob worked tirelessly in the United States Senate for his fellow Utahns. His commitment to his constituents transcended partisanship and he often reached across the aisle to get things done. He was a dedicated public servant and his work-- like efforts to save the country from economic collapse-- is exemplary of what we can accomplish when we put aside our differences and focus on our common goals. Michelle and I offer our deepest condolences to Bob's wife Joyce, and their children and grandchildren.\n\n\n\n\n"
