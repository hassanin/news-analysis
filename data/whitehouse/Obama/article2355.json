He also stressed the importance of strengthening U.N. reform efforts, including ensuring effective and accountable peacekeeping and strengthening and modernizing U.N. institutions.\n\n\t \n\n\tThe international community is asking more of the U.N. today than ever before, from negotiating ends to conflicts, deploying peacekeepers to protect, mitigating threats from climate change, responding to humanitarian catastrophes, and providing urgently-needed assistance to refugees and other vulnerable migrants around the world.  As a founding member and host country of the U.N., and as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, the United States is firmly committed to continuing our longstanding, strong support of U.N. efforts to make a more peaceful, secure and prosperous world.\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
