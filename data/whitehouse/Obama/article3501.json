As we work to confirm the facts, we condemn any such attack and offer our condolences for any injury or loss of life. Now more than ever, it will be important for Iraq and Turkey to accelerate their efforts to de-escalate tensions, ensure dialogue remains constructive, reaffirm support for Iraqi security and sovereignty, and strengthen their cooperation against ISIL.\n\n\n\n\n"
