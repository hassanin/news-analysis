Rice on the Selection of Avril Haines as Deputy National Security Advisor\n\n\n\n\nI am thrilled to welcome Avril back to the National Security Council (NSC) to serve as my principal deputy.  Previously at the State Department, NSC and Central Intelligence Agency, Avril has been indispensable in implementing the Administration’s strategy to address the full range of threats and challenges to our national security. Anyone who has worked with Avril can only be deeply impressed by her keen intellect, her intense dedication to serving the American people, and her proven ability to get things done.  They also know what an extraordinary colleague and delightful person she is.  I could not be happier that Avril will help me lead the dedicated NSC staff as we continue to make our country safer and stronger and advance American leadership in the world.\nI also wish once more to thank Tony Blinken for his extraordinary service to the NSC.  I look forward to continuing to work closely with him in his new role as Deputy Secretary of State.\n\n\n\n\n"
