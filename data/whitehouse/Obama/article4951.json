Leadership that recalls the promise of South Sudan is what the country now needs to end this senseless conflict.\nTo the people of South Sudan, who have suffered for far too long, I urge you to renew the spirit of hope, unity, and fortitude that enabled you almost four years ago to come together and vote for a brighter future.  For the sake of future generations, I urge you to seek peaceful reconciliation rather than violent retribution. The United States will remain a friend to those who seek peace and progress, and will stand with the people of South Sudan.\n\n\n\n\n"
