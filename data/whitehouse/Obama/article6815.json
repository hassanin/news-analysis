The President reiterated that the brinksmanship strategy of shutting down the government and threatening default as a bargaining tactic is one that the country cannot afford. He argued that the prolonged shutdown is having adverse consequences on consumer confidence and businesses, and is hurting local economies across the country that rely on tourism at national parks and monuments. The President reiterated that he is prepared to negotiate on ways to grow the economy, create jobs, and address our nation’s long term fiscal health – but that we shouldn’t do this in a crisis atmosphere amidst a government shutdown and threat of default.\n\n\n\n\n"
