and\n (viii)  the heads of agencies or offices as the Co Chairs may designate.\n (b)  A member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task Force functions of the member, senior officials who are part of the member's agency or office, and who are full-time officers or employees of the Federal Government.\n Sec. 2.  Mission and Function of the Task Force.  (a)  The Task Force shall work with agencies to develop a coordinated Federal response to campus rape and sexual assault.  The functions of the Task Force are advisory only and shall include making recommendations to meet the following objectives:\n(i)    providing institutions with evidence-based best and promising practices for preventing and responding to rape and sexual assault;\n(ii)   building on the Federal Government's existing enforcement efforts to ensure that institutions comply fully with their legal obligations to prevent and respond to rape and sexual assault;\n(iii)  increasing the transparency of the Federal Government's enforcement activities concerning rape and sexual assault, consistent with applicable law and the interests of affected students;\n(iv)   broadening the public's awareness of individual institutions' compliance with their legal obligation to address rape and sexual assault; and\n(v)    facilitating coordination among agencies engaged in addressing rape and sexual assault and those charged with helping bring institutions into compliance with the law.\n (b)  In accordance with applicable law and in addition to regular meetings, the Task Force shall consult with external stakeholders, including institution officials, student groups, parents, athletic and educational associations, local rape crisis centers, and law enforcement agencies.\n (c)  Because rape and sexual assault also occur in the elementary and secondary school context, the Task Force shall evaluate how its proposals and recommendations may apply to, and may be implemented by, schools, school districts, and other elementary and secondary educational entities receiving Federal financial assistance.\n Sec. 3.  Action Plan.  (a)  Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Task Force shall develop and submit proposals and recommendations to the President for:\n(i)    providing examples of instructions, policies, and protocols for institutions, including: rape and sexual assault policies;

and\n(iv)   promoting greater coordination and consistency among the agencies and offices that enforce the Federal laws addressing campus rape and sexual assault and support improved campus responses to sexual violence.\n (b)  Within 1 year of the date of this memorandum, and then on an annual basis, the Task Force shall provide a report to the President on implementation efforts with respect to this memorandum.\n Sec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n (b)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an agency or the head thereof;
