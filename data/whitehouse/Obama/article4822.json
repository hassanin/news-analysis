Moreover, when the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Jews are repressed, the rights and freedoms of other minorities and other sectors are often not far behind.  For all these reasons, combating anti-Semitism is an essential responsibility for all of us.  Every nation, every region, and every community must do its part.  I call on the members of the UN General Assembly to lend their voice to this struggle, and pledge the unwavering support of the United States as we wage this fight together.\n\n\n\n\n"
