More than 4,000 students from across New York high schools will be in attendance.  \n\t \n\tCollege Signing Day continues the First Lady’s efforts to inspire young people to pursue their education past high school. In addition to the First Lady’s event in New York, more than 1,000 College Signing Day events have been planned in nearly every state by communities, students, and organizations committed to helping students pursue higher education. The First Lady is encouraging people across the country to join her in marking College Signing Day by wearing college apparel and sharing the importance of higher education on social media through #CollegeSigningDay and #BetterMakeRoom.\n\t \n\tLast October, the First Lady launched Better Make Room, a public awareness campaign targeted at Generation Z, or young people ages 14-19, to celebrate education, change the national conversation, and give students the tools and resources they need to continue their education past high school. The Better Make Room campaign engages actors, singers, and sports icons in celebrating students for pursuing higher education. This past December the First Lady teamed up with College Humor, The Gregory Brothers, and Jay Pharoah to record the music video \"Go To College,\" which will be performed at the event tomorrow. \n\t \n\tThe following individuals will join the First Lady in celebrating over 4,000 students at the Harlem Armory:\n\n\n\t\tAidy Bryant\n\n\t\tAJ Calloway\n\n\t\tAlessia Cara\n\n\t\tAllan Houston \n\n\t\tAllison Williams\n\n\t\tBailee Madison\n\n\t\tBen Falcone\n\n\t\tBradie Gene James\n\n\t\tBrandon Carr\n\n\t\tCalvin Johnson \n\n\t\tCarla Hall \n\n\t\tCarmelo Anthony\n\n\t\tChef Roble\n\n\t\tCommon\n\n\t\tDarren Criss\n\n\t\tDaymond John\n\n\t\tDerek Hough\n\n\t\tDeon Grant\n\n\t\tDiggy Simmons\n\n\t\tElle Varner\n\n\t\tEmmy Rossum\n\n\t\tFC Harlem Team Members\n\n\t\tJay Pharoah\n\n\t\tJidenna\n\n\t\tJon Rudnitsky\n\n\t\tJulianna Margulies\n\n\t\tKelvin Beachum\n\n\t\tLa La Anthony \n\n\t\tLZ Granderson\n\n\t\tMatt and Kim\n\n\t\tMatthew Morrison\n\n\t\tMariska Hargitay\n\n\t\tMario Batali\n\n\t\tMelissa Benoist\n\n\t\tMelissa McCarthy \n\n\t\tNicole Beharie\n\n\t\tSasheer Zamata\n\n\t\tTed Allen\n\n\t\tTom Colicchio\n\n\t\tTracee Ellis Ross\n\n\t\tYara Shahidi\n\n\n\tThis event will be hosted by MTV in conjunction with Viacom's Get Schooled initiative.
