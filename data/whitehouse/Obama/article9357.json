Liveris, Dow Chairman and CEO Backs American Jobs Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\tStatement From The Dow Chemical Company With Reference to President’s September 8 Address to Congress\n\n\tMIDLAND, MICHIGAN – September 9, 2011 – Andrew N. Liveris, Dow's chairman and CEO, stated today, with reference to President Obama’s September 8 address to a joint session of Congress:\n\n\tI applaud President Obama for giving the economy and jobs the attention it so clearly demands, and more specifically I am pleased he is highlighting the importance of trade and infrastructure.  The President is right to focus on opening access to foreign markets and supporting Congressional adoption of the pending free trade agreements, as well an ongoing and robust investment in rebuilding of the nation’s infrastructure.  Both elements are essential to creating quality jobs here in the U.S., and are fundamental to the national effort to reinvigorate the manufacturing sector and advanced manufacturing in particular.  These actions can stimulate jobs in the near term and are critical to the nation’s long-term competitiveness. \n\n\tThe President’s proposals deserve a rich debate, and we urge Congress to rapidly consider and adopt those aspects that will have the most immediate impact to boost the economy and grow American jobs. \n\n\n\n\n"
