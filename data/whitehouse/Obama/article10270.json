Buckles\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMichelle and I were inspired by the service and life story of former Army Corporal Frank W. Buckles, the last surviving American veteran of World War I and the oldest known World War I era veteran in the world, who passed away yesterday at the age of 110.  A decorated soldier in the Great War, he also survived more than three years in Japanese prisoner of war camps during the Second World War.\n\t \n\tFrank Buckles lived the American Century.  Like so many veterans, he returned home, continued his education, began a career, and along with his late wife Audrey, raised their daughter Susannah.  And just as Frank continued to serve America until his passing, as the Honorary Chairman of the World War I Memorial Foundation, our nation has a sacred obligation to always serve our veterans and their families as well as they’ve served us.  We join Susannah and all those who knew and loved her father in celebrating a remarkable life that reminds us of the true meaning of patriotism and our obligations to each other as Americans.\n\n\n\n\n"
