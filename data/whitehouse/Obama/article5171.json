The President conveyed his thoughts and prayers to their two colleagues who were infected with Ebola and wished them a speedy recovery. He emphasized the importance of integrating lessons learned from Dallas into response plans going forward, and reviewed the additional steps that have been taken to strengthen the Nation’s ability to respond quickly and effectively should new Ebola cases emerge. The President concluded by noting the difficult conditions under which doctors, nurses, lab technicians, and caregivers work on a daily basis in hospitals throughout the country, and praised Texas Presbyterian staff for staying focused on the vital mission of caring for others in times of need regardless of the difficult circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n"
