I was honored to serve with him, to know him, and to call him a friend.\nGeorge believed deeply in public service. It defined him as a Senator and as a man. And he never stopped serving for his entire life – whether it was his courage in World War II, his time in Congress, or his fight to eliminate hunger at home and abroad.\nAbove all, George McGovern was a generous, kind, honorable man. He will be missed, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family today.\n \n###\n\n\n\n\n"
