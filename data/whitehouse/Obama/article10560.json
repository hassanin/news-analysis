The President led the working session that lasted for more than four hours and included discussions on ideas for investment in innovation and entrepreneurship, reforming our education system and providing better training and preparation for workers, opening up our global markets through trade and export promotion, taking a balanced approach to regulation that will promote, rather than undermine, economic growth and encouraging investment in the United States. The President concluded the session by asking the attendees to continue the dialogue with him on a shared agenda focused on moving our economy forward that not only continues to grow the economy, but also ensures America is competing and leading in the world.\n\n\tÂ \n\n\n\n\n"
