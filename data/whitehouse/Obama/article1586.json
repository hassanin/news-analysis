and\n\n\t(f)  identifying ways to use innovative technologies to accomplish the customer service activities above, thereby lowering costs, decreasing service delivery times, and improving the customer experience.\n\nSec. 3.  Publication of Agency Customer Service Plans.  Each agency shall publish its plan on its Open Government web page.\n\nSec. 4.  Assistance in Implementation.  In consultation with the heads of executive departments and agencies, the Chief Performance Officer, who also serves as the Deputy Director for Management of the OMB, shall develop guidance for implementing the activities outlined in this order.  Such guidance shall include, among other things, the nature and scope of services to which the order's requirements will apply.  The Office of Management and Budget, the General Services Administration, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall assist and support agencies in developing customer service standards and plans, online posting of customer service metrics and best practices, expediting review for customer feedback mechanisms under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), improving the design and management of agency websites providing services or information to the public in compliance with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d), and using innovative technologies to improve customer service at lower costs.\n\nSec. 5.  Independent Agencies.  Independent agencies are requested to adhere to this order.\n\nSec. 6.  Privileged Information.  Nothing in this order shall compel or authorize the disclosure of privileged information, law enforcement information, information affecting national security, or information the disclosure of which is prohibited by law.\n\nSec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n\t(i)   authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n\t(ii)  functions of the Director of the OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n\t(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n\t(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tApril 27, 2011.\n\n\n\n\n"
