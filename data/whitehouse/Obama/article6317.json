    "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary\n\n\nFor Immediate Release\nFebruary 25, 2014\n\n \n\n\n\nNotice -- Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Cuba and of the Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and Movement of Vessels\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE \n- - - - - - - \nCONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT \nTO CUBA AND OF THE EMERGENCY AUTHORITY RELATING TO THE \nREGULATION OF THE ANCHORAGE AND MOVEMENT OF VESSELS \nOn March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by the Cuban government of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba. On February 26, 2004, by Proclamation 7757, the national emergency was extended and its scope was expanded to deny monetary and material support to the Cuban government. The Cuban government has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the use of excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft that may engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. In addition, the unauthorized entry of any U.S.-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters continues to be detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set out in Proclamation 6867 as amended by Proclamation 7757. \nThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress. \nBARACK OBAMA \n\n\n\n\n"
