President Obama launched YLAI last year to expand opportunities for emerging entrepreneurs and civil society innovators in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The inaugural YLAI class brings 250 promising young business and social entrepreneurs from across Latin America to invest in and accelerate the work of young leaders who are making their communities and countries more prosperous and secure. \n\n\tParticipants will travel to the United States for a five-week program that will strengthen their leadership, innovation, and entrepreneurial skills and provide networking opportunities with U.S. entrepreneurs, innovators, and investors; diaspora communities; and amongst each other to increase connectivity throughout the hemisphere.  YLAI, one of four programs within the Young Leaders Initiatives, is a part of President Obama’s commitment to empower young people around the world and ensure they have the tools, skills, and networks to tackle our shared global challenges. \n\n\tAdditional information about this class of YLAI Fellows is available at www.ylai.state.gov.\n\n\n\n\n"
