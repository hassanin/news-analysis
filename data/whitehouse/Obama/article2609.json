Building on the progress made during the first U.S.-Africa Business Forum in Washington, D.C. in 2014, the Forum will once again bring together African heads of state and government and U.S. and African CEOs. It will be an opportunity to forge new partnerships to continue to address the continent's most pressing challenges and to build a stronger, more sustainable future for citizens on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\n\n"
