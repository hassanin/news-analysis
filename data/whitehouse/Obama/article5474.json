The two leaders agreed that any Russian intervention in Ukraine, even under purported \"humanitarian\" auspices, without the formal, express consent and authorization of the Government of Ukraine is unacceptable, violates international law,  and will provoke additional consequences.  They reiterated that we continue to urge Russia to engage with the international community and the Ukrainian government to find a political solution to the crisis.\n\n\n\n"
