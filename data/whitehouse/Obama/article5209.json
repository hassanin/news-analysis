Rice on the Chibok Girls\n\n\n\n\nSix months ago today, approximately 270 girls were abducted in the middle of the night from their school in northeast Nigeria, where they were learning the skills they need to create a better future for themselves, their families, and their communities. The United States has made clear our commitment to supporting Nigeria’s efforts to bring the girls home safely. Since then, we have aided in the investigations, including by deploying personnel on the ground, facilitated strategic communications, and provided assistance to the families. These efforts are part of our broader support to Nigeria’s pursuit of a holistic counterterrorism strategy, which includes the rule of law and strengthened security institutions. \nWe will continue to work toward the release of all the girls who remain in captivity, even as we celebrate the freedom of the few who have managed to escape Boko Haram’s clutches.  And, we will stand with girls everywhere who seek to achieve their full potential through education and to claim the universal rights and fundamental freedoms that are their birthright. \n\n\n\n\n"
