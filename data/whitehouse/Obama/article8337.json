During all of these discussions, he reiterated the United States’ commitment to the strategy laid out by President Obama and reviewed our joint progress on the five elements of that strategy: transition to an Afghan security lead by the end of 2014; training sufficient and sustainable Afghan Security Forces; building an enduring partnership with Afghanistan; supporting Afghan-led reconciliation; and promoting regional stability.\n\n\n\n\n"
