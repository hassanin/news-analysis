A proud alumnus of, and advocate for, the Peace Corps, Sam also has worked to improve lives in communities around the world.  I look forward to continuing to work with Sam in the months ahead, and Michelle and I send him and his wife, Shary, our best wishes as they begin this new chapter of their lives. \n\n\n\n\n"
