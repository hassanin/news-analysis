The unauthorized entry of any U.S.-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters continues to be detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set out in Proclamation 6867 as amended by Proclamation 7757 and as further modified by Proclamation 9398.\n\n\tThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\n\n\t \n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\t \n\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tJanuary 13, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n"
