Once more, the people of Lebanon have demonstrated to the world their courage and the strength of their commitment to democracy.\n\n\t\tThe United States will continue to support a sovereign and independent Lebanon, committed to peace, including the full implementation of all United Nations Security Council Resolutions.  It is our sincere hope that the next government will continue along the path towards building a sovereign, independent and stable Lebanon.  \n\n\t\tGovernment of the people and by the people sets a single standard for all who hold power: you must maintain your power through consent, not coercion; you must respect the rights of minorities, and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise; you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party.  Commitment to these principles of peace and moderation are the best means to secure a sovereign and prosperous Lebanon.\n\n\n\t\t##\n\n\n\n\n\n"
