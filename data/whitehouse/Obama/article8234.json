For months, President Obama has been calling on Congress to take up these two important priorities before middle class families pay the price for inaction. Thanks to Congress heeding that call today, millions of American students will avoid a $1,000 debt hike while millions of construction workers will be able to stay on the job. But there is still much more Congress can do to create jobs and grow the economy, and the President will keep up pressure until they pass pieces of his American Jobs Act that independent economists say could put us on the path of creating another million jobs. \n\n\n\n\n"
