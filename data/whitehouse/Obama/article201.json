As our country continues to recover from serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare, however, we must maintain efforts to keep our Nation on a sustainable fiscal course. This effort requires tough choices, especially in light of budget constraints.\n\n\tAccordingly, I have determined it is appropriate to exercise my authority under section 1009(e) of title 37, United States Code, to set the 2017 monthly basic pay increase at 1.6 percent. This decision is consistent with my fiscal year 2017 Budget and it will not materially affect the Federal Government's ability to attract and retain well-qualified members for the uniformed services.\n\n\tThe adjustments described above shall take effect on January 1, 2017.\n\n\tSincerely,\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
