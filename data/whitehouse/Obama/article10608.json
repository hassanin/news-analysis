Bill Ritter issued the following statement today supporting President Obama’s proposal to provide tax relief to American families and businesses still struggling through the worst economy in nearly eight decades:\n\n\t“As a Governor, I have seen first hand what this economic downturn – the worst since the Great Depression – has done to Colorado families, small business, ranches and farms, and especially to those who have lost their jobs. This is not the time for more delay and bickering in Washington; it’s the time to provide tax relief to our families and businesses, and to extend again unemployment benefits for Coloradans struggling to move forward in this tough economy.\n\n\t“I support President Obama’s efforts to compromise with both Republicans and Democrats on these critical issues. While this package is not perfect, I know from experience that governing responsibly and effectively means compromising and making tough decisions every day, decisions with which someone can always find fault. But decisions must be made, we must move this country forward in a bipartisan way, and Washington must provide our families and small businesses some stability and predictability in our nation’s fiscal policy.\n\n\t“I applaud the President and his team for their hard work, and urge the Congress to act quickly on this package.”\n\n\n\n\n"
