Ambassador Crocker’s tireless and passionate focus on achieving our objective in Afghanistan has kept us safer and more secure, and completes another chapter in an unmatched career of diplomatic service in the most challenging postings. Ambassador Crocker will depart his role as the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan with the President’s, and the nation’s, great thanks and admiration.\n\n\n\n\n"
