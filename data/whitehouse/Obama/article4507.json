One of the hallmarks of a functioning democracy is the handover of power from one elected leader to another. I have spoken to President Goodluck Jonathan and President-elect Muhammadu Buhari recently, and today I commend them both on their statesmanship in leading their supporters through this historic vote and putting their country on a more peaceful path forward. President Jonathan’s graciousness in conceding defeat is a credit to his legacy and an act of principled patriotism. It strengthens the country he has led. It sets the tone for gubernatorial elections on April 11th and for the days ahead as Nigerians unite to ensure a successful transition. The next Nigerian government will face formidable challenges in fighting corruption and terrorism and promoting inter-communal peace. We look forward to working closely with President-elect Buhari to advance our shared interest in Nigeria’s success. \n\n\n\n\n"
