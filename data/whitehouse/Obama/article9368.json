We don’t have time to waste on the same old failed policies of deregulation and lower taxes that drove our economy off the cliff in the first place.  All our elected leaders will be judged by whether they act with integrity and energy to create good jobs now.\n\n\tPoliticians need to recognize that America’s best days are still before us. We will not accept the disappearance of the American middle class or several more years of crisis-level joblessness.  We can and must solve the jobs crisis and we must start now.  Our country is too good and too rich to weaken our commitment to safety net protections such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Unemployment Insurance.\n\n\n\n\n"
