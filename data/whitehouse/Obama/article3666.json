It was the Soviet regime’s deliberate seizure of Ukrainian crops and refusal to provide food relief that turned Europe’s breadbasket into a land of immeasurable human suffering.\n\n\tDespite decades of totalitarian rule, Ukrainians refused to abandon their drive for freedom and independence.  And as the Ukrainian people face new threats to their territory and well-being, they have once again demonstrated their resolute commitment to human dignity.  Ukraine’s modern struggle for freedom and democracy is a testament to the unbreakable spirit of its people and honors the memory of the many who perished under Stalin’s brutal rule.\n\n\tIt is incumbent upon us to remember the horrors of the past as we renew our commitment to the prevention of future atrocities. Through the tireless efforts of the Ukrainian-American community and friends of the Ukrainian people, a memorial now stands in the heart of our nation’s capital, allowing Americans to share in the somber memory of the Holodomor and reflect upon our shared determination to build a better world.\n\n\n\n\n"
