We will continue to work with the Congress over the coming days as it finalizes work on this important bill, and in our ongoing efforts to hold Iran accountable.  As that effort progresses, we will also work with our allies and take independent action under the President’s existing authorities, as we did last week in designating additional entities for sanctions.”\n\n\n\n\n"
