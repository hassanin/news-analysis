Corruption has been a core public grievance in the region, and the United States has worked closely with the new governments and citizens of Arab countries in transition as they fight corruption and seek justice by recovering stolen assets.  As the president of the G8 in 2012, the United States is supporting these aspirations by leading a coalition to focus on asset recovery as part of the Deauville Partnership. \nThe Arab Forum on Asset Recovery will bring together the G8, the Deauville Partnership with Arab Countries in Transition, regional countries and international organizations to advance this work.\n\n\n\n\n"
