Many of these new tools – such as Super 301, elements of the ENFORCE Act and the Level the Playing Field Act, and constructive tools to address unfair currency practices – would strengthen our ability to both facilitate trade and improve enforcement of the rules. We must also repeal the consumptive demand exception for child and forced labor. \nI look forward to working with both chambers to improve certain provisions and to ensure swift, strong and effective enforcement. These critical enforcement tools are complementary to new trade agreements. This legislation should be considered and reach my desk as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n"
