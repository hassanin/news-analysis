Janice and I both believe that in order to win the future, we need to create jobs and grow our economy and pursue a balanced approach to deficit reduction.  In Congress, Janice will continue to fight for the people of the South Bay and add another chapter to her family’s long history of dedicated service to the people of California.  I look forward to working with her.\n\n\n\n\n"
