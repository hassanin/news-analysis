The 20 finalists are profiled at  http://joiningforces.challenge.gov/. The public is encouraged to participate in this Challenge by voting for their favorite submission to be the People’s Choice Winner, which will be announced on March 16, 2012. \n\nFive additional winners will be chosen with input from a panel of distinguished judges, including:\n\n\t• Tom Brokaw, NBC News Special Correspondent and author of five bestsellers including The Greatest Generation;\n\t• J.R. Martinez, Iraq war veteran, motivational speaker and winner of season 13 of Dancing with the Stars,\n\t• Sloan D. Gibson, President and CEO, United Service Organizations (USO);\n\t• Julian Castro – Mayor of San Antonio, one of the nation’s largest military communities; and\n\t• Deanie Dempsey, military family advocate and wife of General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThis Spring, the First Lady and Dr. Biden will honor the 20 Joining Forces Community Challenge finalists at the White House where the five winners will be announced.\n\n\t“Jill and I have asked organizations large and small to direct some of their efforts toward our troops and their families, and today we’re thrilled to congratulate 20 groups who are doing just that,” said First Lady Michelle Obama.  “These organizations are doing what they do best: providing financial assistance for scholarships and child care, working to build self-esteem in military teens, offering free photo sessions for military families, and so much more.  Creative ideas like these can be replicated in communities all across the country, and we can’t wait to see what Americans come up with next.”\n\n\t“As Second Lady, I have had the tremendous honor of visiting with service members and military families and learning about the many acts of kindness taking place all across the country in their communities to support them,” said Dr. Jill Biden. “All of the submissions for the Joining Forces Community Challenge demonstrate exactly the spirit of service and dedication we see everywhere we go.  We hope that the great work of these organizations inspire more Americans to take on similar efforts to support military families in their own communities.”\n\n\tThe First Lady and Dr. Biden launched Joining Forces last year as a way to encourage all Americans to support our troops and serve our nation’s military families.
