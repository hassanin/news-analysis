We encourage partners to meet in full pledges made at the 2009 Tokyo Donors meeting in addition to new pledges that are related to the floods.\nThe U.S. and the UK affirm their commitment to sustained long-term post-flood reconstruction in Pakistan, beyond the immediate humanitarian needs.  We encourage other members of the international community to remain engaged as well.  Stability in Pakistan, underpinned by economic and democratic development, is vital for the stability of the region and for security in the wider world.\n\t \n\tOn behalf of our two countries we pledge our unshakeable support for the people of Pakistan in the wake of this natural disaster.  But our support does not end here.  We reaffirm our commitment to enhancing our respective strategic partnerships with Pakistan, on the basis of shared interests and mutual respect.\nWe recognize also the role that the international community has in helping Pakistan to address a range of challenges across development, security, and governance.  We look to the Friends of Democratic Pakistan Ministerial meeting in October to mobilize further political support on these agendas.\n\n\n\n\n"
