This bill will help ensure that insurers abide by common-sense rules that prevent bid-rigging, price-fixing, and other practices that drive up health care costs for the American people.\nRepealing the antitrust exemption for health insurers is an important step toward achieving reform that gives families and business owners greater control over their health care. I look forward to meeting with congressional leaders tomorrow to continue this critical discussion.”\n\n\n\n"
