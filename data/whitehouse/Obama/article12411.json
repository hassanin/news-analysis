In a separate call, I spoke with Sec. Napolitano to receive an update on both the Department of Homeland Security review of detection capabilities and the enhanced security measures in place since the Christmas Day incident.\nI anticipate receiving assessments from several agencies this evening and will review those tonight and over the course of the weekend.  On Tuesday, in Washington, I will meet personally with relevant agency heads to discuss our ongoing reviews as well as security enhancements and intelligence-sharing improvements in our homeland security and counterterrorism operations. \n\nNOTE: John Brennan is Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.\n\n\n\n"
