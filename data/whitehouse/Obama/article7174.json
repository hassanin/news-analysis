As he has said since the revolution, President Obama reiterated that only Egyptians can make the decisions that will determine their future\n\n\tPresident Obama also underscored his deep concern about violence during the demonstrations, especially sexual assaults against female citizens. He reiterated his belief that all Egyptians protesting should express themselves peacefully, and urged President Morsy to make clear to his supporters that all forms of violence are unacceptable. Finally, the President noted that he is committed to the safety of U.S. diplomats and citizens in Egypt and stressed his expectation that the Government of Egypt continue to protect U.S. diplomatic personnel and facilities.\n\n\n\n\n"
