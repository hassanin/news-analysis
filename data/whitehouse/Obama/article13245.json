In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency and related measures blocking the property of certain persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in Belarus are to continue in effect beyond June 16, 2009.\n\n\tDespite some positive developments during the past year, including the release of internationally recognized political prisoners, the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons that have undermined democratic processes or institutions, committed human rights abuses related to political repression, and engaged in public corruption pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and related measures blocking the property of certain persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in Belarus.\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tJune 12, 2009.\n\n\n\n\t\t###\n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t_________________________________________________________________________\n\t\tFor Immediate Release                                                       June 12, 2009\n\n\t\tNOTICE\n\t\t- - - - - - -\nCONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE\n\t\tACTIONS AND POLICIES OF CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT\n\t\tOF BELARUS AND OTHER PERSONS THAT UNDERMINE DEMOCRATIC\n\t\tPROCESSES OR INSTITUTIONS IN BELARUS\n\n\tOn June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405, the President declared a national emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of certain persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in Belarus, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons that have undermined democratic processes or institutions; committed human rights abuses related to political repression, including detentions and disappearances; and engaged in public corruption, including by diverting or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing public authority.\n\n\tDespite some positive developments in the past year, including the release of internationally recognized political prisoners, the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Accordingly, the national emergency declared on June 16, 2006, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 16, 2009. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405.\n\n\tThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tJune 12, 2009.\n\n\n\n\n"
