PDT MR. BURTON: Good afternoon. The President made an offhand remark making fun of his own bowling that was in no way intended to disparage the Special Olympics. He thinks that the Special Olympics are a wonderful program that gives an opportunity to shine to people with disabilities from around the world. All right. Do you guys need anything? You've got the guidance, you've got -- Q Do you when we're going to get Geithner's bank plan out -- any plan on the banks? MR. BURTON: Soon, but I don't have a date for you? Q Soon? Like a week soon, or next week soon? MR. BURTON: Soon, but I don't have a date. I'll keep you posted, though. You'll be the first person I tell. Q Very first. I'll hold you to that. MR. BURTON: -- and you second. (Laughter.) Q CNN will be the first. (Laughter.) Anything on autos -- any other new plans on autos coming out? MR. BURTON: No, nothing beyond what happened today with the auto suppliers. So if you guys think of any good, tough questions, I'm just a couple feet away. Q What about -- so Dodd is basically putting the entire burden of the change that was made in the stimulus plan language on the bonuses on the administration. Is he being fair? MR. BURTON: Having been on planes and helicopters all day long, I can't say that I've seen the full extent of all the remarks that were made. So I'm just going to refer you to Secretary Geithner's interview with CNN where he addressed the issue. All right. END   6:32 P.M. PDT\n\n\n\n"
