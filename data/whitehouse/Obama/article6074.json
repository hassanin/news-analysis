Burns\n\n\n\n\nSince I met Bill in Moscow in 2005, I have admired his skill and precision. Since I took office, I have relied on him for candid advice and sensitive diplomatic missions – he has been a skilled advisor, consummate diplomat, and inspiration to generations of public servants. Given his vital role on our leading priorities, earlier this year I asked him to delay his retirement, and I’m grateful to him and Lisa for doing so.  The country is stronger for Bill’s service.\nClick HERE for a photo of President Barack Obama meeting with William \"Bill\" Burns, Deputy Secretary of State, for lunch in the Oval Office Private Dining Room, Feb. 18, 2014.
