Mark was always a fighter.  It’s the spirit he brought to more than two decades of public service on behalf of the people of Hawaii.  He stood up for America’s most vulnerable.  He championed our troops and veterans, and proudly wore our nation’s uniform.   And his relentless push for cancer research inspired countless Americans fighting the same battle as him.  Simply put, our country is better off because of Mark’s contributions.  He leaves a legacy of courage, of service, and of hope.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Mark's wife, Sami, their two children, and his many friends and family.\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
