In the House of Representatives, Brad helped lead the fight to protect families from abuses by the financial industry, and is a key reason why today we finally have a strong watchdog in place looking out for American consumers. Michelle and I thank Brad for his service, and wish him the very best in the future.Â \n\n\n\n\n"
