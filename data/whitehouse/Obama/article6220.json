The President has repeatedly called on Congress to take action on a compromise solution to extend this vital lifeline for millions of hard-working Americans as they look for work and support their families. This is not just the right thing to do for these Americans looking for work, itâ€™s the right thing to do for our economy. The President urges the Senate to pass the bill and for the House to do the same so that he can sign it into law.\n\n\n\n\n"
