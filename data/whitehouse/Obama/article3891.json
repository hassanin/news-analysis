President Obama and Vice President Biden have built upon VAWA’s legacy by committing their Administration to rooting out sexual and domestic violence wherever they exist—especially when these crimes affect our nation’s students. Today, the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault (“Task Force”) released a Resource Guide to support the efforts of students, faculty, administrators, and communities around the country to prevent sexual violence and improve the response to it at colleges and universities. The Resource Guide compiles guidance, tools, model policies and procedures, training and technical assistance, funding opportunities, and public messaging materials that the Obama Administration and external stakeholders have produced concerning campus sexual assault. \n\n\tLater today, Vice President Biden will deliver remarks at the Ohio State University about the importance of preventing sexual assault on college and university campuses across the country. The event will highlight the It’s On Us public awareness and bystander intervention campaign, which seeks to engage students and all members of campus communities in changing the culture to prevent sexual assault.\n\n\tToday’s event in Ohio and the release of the Task Force’s Resource Guide are part of the Administration’s continued fight against sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Over the last six years, the President and Vice President have led the way in tackling these problems everywhere, from college and university campuses to the military to tribal lands and beyond.\n\nResource Guide\n\nThe following resources and sample language documents are intended to be informative and flexible, and to be adapted to address the unique circumstances and needs of distinct campus communities. A “one size fits all” approach is not intended; and ultimately, school policies and programs will vary, reflecting the diverse characteristics, structures, and experiences of each school, as well as differences in state and local legal requirements. Additionally, the resources are neither exhaustive nor exclusive and do not constitute legal advice. As several of the Task Force resources already make clear, the information contained in these resources is illustrative and not a statement of Federal requirements. Finally, the resources below include several links to information from nongovernmental sources. Inclusion in this guide does not indicate endorsement by the Task Force of these entities or materials, nor does the information contained therein necessarily reflect the official views of the U.S. government.\n\n\nCampus climate surveys\n\n\nOnline resource guide on performing a campus climate survey: This website, developed by the Center on Violence Against Women and Children at Rutgers University’s School of Social Work, walks through a campus climate assessment using a survey adapted from the Not Alone toolkit.  (September 2015)\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tResearchers recently released Campus Climate Surveys: Lessons Learned from the Rutgers-New Brunswick Pilot Assessment, a report featuring results and recommendations from a pilot study of the “campus climate survey model” to assess and combat sexual violence on campus.\n\n\n\n“Campus Climate Survey Validation Study” Project Summary: Describes the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics evaluation of a survey adapted from the Not Alone toolkit and piloted in 9 schools.  Approximately 23,000 students participated.
