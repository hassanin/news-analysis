This weekend’s cowardly attacks are an attempt by terrorists to weaken Somalia as it works toward a more representative government.  The United States stands with the people of Somalia during this critical electoral period.  We express our deep sympathies to the victims and their families.  We will continue to support Somali and regional efforts to fight terrorism and extremism and support Somalis in their quest for a peaceful and inclusive future.\n\n\n\n\n"
