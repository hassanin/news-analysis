Within the Act, the Congress appropriated $7.65 billion to the Department of Health and Human Services for the 2009-H1N1 influenza outbreak, including a $5.8 billion contingent appropriation for an influenza pandemic. My Administration appreciates the emergency appropriations that the Congress provided and has initiated the development and procurement of 2009-H1N1 vaccines, is expanding the domestic and international surveillance activities, and is preparing for the possibility that a mass immunization campaign may be needed in the fall. To enhance our Nation's capability to respond to the potential spread of this outbreak, and in accordance with the appropriation, I hereby designate $1.825 billion of the contingent appropriation as emergency funds required to address critical needs related to emerging influenza viruses (specifically, the virus known as 2009-H1N1). These funds will support additional procurement of adjuvant for dose-sparing of vaccine antigen; immunization campaign planning; regulatory activities for H1N1 at the Food and Drug Administration; and funding for the administration of an injury compensation program. There remains much uncertainty about the outbreak and its potential to return this fall during the northern hemisphere flu season. We continue to watch the evolution of the 2009-H1N1 virus and the worldwide outbreaks and are working diligently to plan and prepare for a national response, should it be necessary. We will communicate with you further in the future should additional funds be required. Sincerely,  BARACK OBAMA \n\n\n\n"
