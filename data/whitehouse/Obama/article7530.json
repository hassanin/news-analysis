These Holy Days are a time to reflect on the momentous sacrifice that Jesus Christ made for each of us, and to celebrate the triumph of the Resurrection and His gift of grace. It is a time for renewed hope amidst continued challenges.  It’s also a time to ponder the common values that unite us -- to have compassion for all and to treat others as we wish to be treated ourselves.  As we embrace our loved ones and give thanks for our blessings, we wish all who celebrate with us a blessed Easter.  \n\n\n\n\n"
