Included are amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, State, and the Treasury, as well as the United States Agency for International Development and the Broadcasting Board of Governors. These amendments would provide for costs associated with relief and reconstruction support for Haiti following the devastating earthquake of January 12, 2010, including reimbursement of obligations that have already been incurred by these agencies.\nThe proposed totals for FY 2010 in my FY 2011 Budget would increase by $2.8 billion as a result of these amendments.\nThis request responds to urgent and essential needs. Therefore, I request these proposals be considered as emergency requirements. The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\nSincerely,\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
