The President expressed his condolences for the loss of life as well as the extensive damage to homes in Florida as a result of the storm, and reiterated that his Administration – through FEMA – would remain in close contact with the state as they continued to respond to this event and stood ready to provide additional assistance if necessary. At the request of the State, a FEMA liaison officer is onsite at the Florida state emergency operations center to support state response efforts as needed. The President asked Governor Scott to continue to identify any additional support his administration could provide, and told the Governor that his thoughts and prayers are with the citizens of Florida and the emergency response officials at this difficult time.\n\n\n\n\n"
