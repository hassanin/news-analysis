Administrator McCarthy will also meet with key counterparts while in Vienna.\n\n\tThe Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is a global agreement to protect the stratospheric ozone layer through measures to control production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. The Montreal Protocol has achieved universal ratification and is considered by many to be the most successful multilateral environmental treaty to-date. The upcoming meeting will include discussions on a Montreal Protocol amendment to address emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, potent greenhouse gases that are replacing ozone-depleting substances and are rapidly becoming a major contributor to global climate change. The U.S. delegation also includes representatives from the White House, Department of State, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Agriculture.\n\n\n\n\n"
