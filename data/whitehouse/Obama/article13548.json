As a follow up to the commitment made with other G-20 leaders at the meeting in London last month, President Obama proposes an expansion of the New Arrangements to Borrow fund from $50 billion to $550 billion, of which the US participation would be up to $100 billion.  Such participation does not represent a budgetary expenditure or any increase in the deficit since it effectively represents an exchange of assets.  The letter also asks for a further enlargement of NAB membership to include increased participation in the major emerging market countries.   Below are links to the letters:   Reid: /assets/documents/Reid001.pdf   McConnell: /assets/documents/McCon001.pdf     Pelosi: /assets/documents/Pelos001.pdf    Boehner: /assets/documents/Boehn001.pdf     ##      \n\n\n\n"
