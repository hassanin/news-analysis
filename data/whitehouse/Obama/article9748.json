We regret the loss of life and extend our condolences to all those who have suffered.  Earlier this week, we urged the Syrian government to exercise maximum restraint and not to respond to its own reported losses through additional civilian casualties.  The Syrian government is leading Syria on a dangerous path.  For that reason, it is critical that all Syrians remain united, work to prevent sectarian conflict, and pursue their aspirations peacefully.  We stand by the Syrian people who have shown their courage in demanding dignity and the transition to democracy that they deserve.  \n\n\tSyrian security forces continue to shoot, assault, and arrest demonstrators and political prisoners remain detained.  It’s this kind of appalling violence that leads the United States to support a UN Security Council Resolution condemning the Syrian government’s actions and calling for an immediate halt to the violence and abuse of basic human rights.\n\n\n\n\n"
