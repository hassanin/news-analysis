The ABA, one of the largest and most respected nonpartisan legal organizations in the country, joins a multitude of distinguished voices from across the political spectrum agreeing that Chief Judge Garland has a record of judicial excellence. The President nominated Chief Judge Garland 97 days ago - and given that the average time from nomination to confirmation is 67 days, there is no question that the Senate has abdicated its responsibility under the U.S. Constitution. Filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court is a solemn responsibility that the President and the Senate share under the Constitution, and we call on the Senate to do its job and consider Chief Judge Garland's nomination.\n \nLetter to Honorable W. Neil Eggleston\nABA's Statement\n\n\n\n\n"
