She is as well-respected among her peers as she is versed in the serious issues facing our nation and the world.  Her leadership and counsel will be invaluable to me, and to the entire administration.”\n\t \n\tShailagh Murray became a Capitol Hill correspondent for the Washington Post in 2005.  She has written extensively about fiscal policy, health care reform, and national security issues, including the Iraq war debate, while also covering the 2006, 2008 and 2010 elections. From 1999 to 2005, she covered Congress and politics for the Wall Street Journal's Washington, DC, bureau.  Previously, she was a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal in Prague and Brussels from 1992 to 1999. A native of Buffalo, New York, Shailagh grew up in Virginia and is a graduate of the University of Missouri-Columbia and Northwestern University.\n\t \n\tMurray joins the Vice President’s communications office, which includes Press Secretary Elizabeth Alexander, Deputy Press Secretary Amy Dudley and Assistant Press Secretary Liz Allen.\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
