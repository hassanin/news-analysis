In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice, stating that the emergency caused by the lapse of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, is to continue in effect for 1 year beyond August 17, 2010.\n\n                                  Sincerely, \n                                  BARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n"
