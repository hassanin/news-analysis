Mrs. Obama planted the garden to initiate a national conversation around the health and wellbeing of our nation—a conversation that evolved into her Let’s Move! initiative. You can follow the White House Kitchen Garden on Instagram at @WHKitchenGarden.\n\n\tThis event is free and open to the public; however, a ticket is required for all attendees (including small children).
