Through a federal commitment to a long-term rebuilding effort, our roads, bridges, hospitals and businesses are coming back stronger than before.  \nThat’s who we are as Americans – we take care of our own.  We leave nobody behind.  And as long as our fellow Americans continue to travel the long and sometimes difficult road to recovery, their country will stay with them every step of the way.\n\n\n\n\n"
