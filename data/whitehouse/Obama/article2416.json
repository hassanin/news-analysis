Rice’s Meeting with First Vice President Taban Deng\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNational Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met today with the First Vice President of South Sudan Taban Deng.  Ambassador Rice affirmed the Administration’s strong commitment to the people of South Sudan and expressed grave concern about the humanitarian conditions and continued fighting in many parts of the country.  Ambassador Rice deplored the South Sudanese Government's role in continually obstructing the United Nations Mission in South Sudan's (UNMISS) operations and stressed the need for a rapid deployment of the Regional Protection Force.  Ambassador Rice relayed to Deng that the United States was deeply concerned about the alleged participation of government forces in attacks against humanitarian workers at the Terrain Compound in Juba on July 11.  She said that the perpetrators of the attack must be identified and held accountable and that an investigation with international support is urgently needed.  Ambassador Rice underscored the need for the South Sudanese Government to engage opposition groups in dialogue and ensure that it governs inclusively, with strong participation by women and without domination by a single ethnic group or political party. \n\n\n\n\n"
