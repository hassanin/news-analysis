In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication stating that the Iran emergency declared on March 15, 1995, is to continue in effect beyond March 15, 2010.\nThe crisis between the United States and Iran resulting from actions and policies of the Government of Iran that led to the declaration of a national emergency on March 15, 1995, has not been resolved. The actions and policies of the Government of Iran are contrary to the interests of the United States in the region and pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to Iran and maintain in force comprehensive sanctions against Iran to respond to this threat.\nBARACK OBAMA\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tMarch 10, 2010.\n\n\n\n\n"
