As strong NATO allies, the United States and Poland are working together to promote stability, security and economic opportunity in Europe, Afghanistan and around the world.\n\tI look forward to deepening the enduring ties between the United States and Poland when I visit Warsaw later this month.\n\n\n\n\n"
