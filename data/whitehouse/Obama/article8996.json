Violence against women undermines not only the safety and dignity of millions of women and girls, but also the health, economic stability, and security of nations. The U.S. government remains committed to advancing the rights of women at home and as an integral component of our foreign policy. On this International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, we stand with women and men around the world in saying one violation is one too many, and in renewing our commitment to the right of women and girls to be free from violence and abuse.\n\n\n\n\n"
