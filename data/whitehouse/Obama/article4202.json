The President reinforced that Congress must pass TAA, which will expire soon, to ensure that we are helping all our workers compete in the global economy. The President expressed his gratitude to these Democrats for supporting these trade bills that will be good for American workers and help American businesses compete on a level playing field.  \n\n\n\n\n"
