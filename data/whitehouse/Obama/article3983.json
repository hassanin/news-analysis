Circuit Court Ruling Dismissing Immigration Lawsuit\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWe are pleased that the D.C. Circuit did not allow Sheriff Arpaio's lawsuit to stand in the way of commonsense measures to advance public safety and bring greater accountability to our immigration system. The court correctly recognized that the Constitution does not permit federal courts to hear lawsuits that rest on baseless speculation.  As the district court properly observed, the deferred action programs that Sheriff Arpaio challenged represent the “valid exercise of prosecutorial discretion.” We will continue to work toward resolving the legal challenges so that the Administration can move forward with implementing all of the President's commonsense immigration policies.\n\n\n\n\n"
