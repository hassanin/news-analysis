President Anastasiades informed the Vice President about the latest discussions on a comprehensive settlement and the Vice President reaffirmed the United States' strong support for a settlement to reunify Cyprus as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with political equality. The two leaders also discussed the crisis in Ukraine, and the Vice President underscored the need to impose costs on Russia if it continued on its current path and failed to actively support a ceasefire, a roadmap for peace talks, the release of hostages, an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) border monitoring mission, and a halt to the transfer of heavy weapons and equipment to the separatists.\n\n\n\n\n"
