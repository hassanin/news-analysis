The two Presidents took the opportunity to discuss the tragic events that took place in Benghazi, including the death of U.S. Embassy personnel.  President Karzai expressed condolences for the tragic loss of American life and the Presidents discussed the importance of working together to help ensure that the circumstances that led to the violence in Libya and Egypt do not pose a threat to U.S. forces or Afghans. President Obama also reaffirmed his commitment to transferring detainees to Afghan authority in a manner that respects Afghan sovereignty and protects U.S. and Afghan forces.  The two Presidents agreed to speak again soon on additional issues of mutual interest.\n\n\n\n\n"
