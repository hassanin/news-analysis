    "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary\n\n\nFor Immediate Release\nApril 22, 2013\n\n \n\n\n\nPresidential Message -- North Pacific Fisheries Convention\n\n\n\n\nTO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:\nWith a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fisheries Resources in the North Pacific Ocean, done at Tokyo on February 24, 2012, and signed by the United States on May 2, 2012 (the \"Convention\"). I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State on the Convention that includes an article-by-article analysis.\nThe Convention establishes a regional fisheries management organization through which Parties will cooperate to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the fisheries resources in the high seas of the North Pacific Ocean while protecting the marine ecosystems in which these resources occur.\nThe Convention will require implementing legislation, which is being drafted and will be submitted separately to the Congress for its consideration.\nCooperation under the Convention will address fisheries resources not covered under preexisting international fisheries management instruments and will help to prevent destructive fishing practices on the high seas that may have impacts on fisheries resources in areas subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Ratification by the United States would also ensure that future U.S. fisheries interests in the region subject to the Convention will be factored into allocation decisions. I therefore recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification at the earliest possible date.\nBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
