The President reiterated his belief in the core American value that if you work hard and play by the rules, you should have the opportunity to succeed -- regardless of the circumstances of your birth. The President thanked the business and foundation leaders for their important work and commitment to make this vision a reality and ensure that more boys and young men of color have the opportunity to get ahead. The foundations supporting today’s call to action have already made extensive investments, including $150 million in current spending. The President vowed to continue collaboration with the business sector and foundation community to build on their success and his call to action. Today, the foundations announced that over the next five years they seek to invest at least $200 million, alongside additional investments from their peers in philanthropy and the business community, to find and rapidly spread solutions that have the highest potential to expand opportunity for these boys and young men of color. The President, foundation and business leaders, as well as elected officials and public figures who have come together around this important initiative are resolved to build ladders of opportunity and unlock the full potential of boys and young men of color – something that will benefit all Americans. \nParticipants in the meeting included:\nBusiness Leaders\n\n\n\t\tJoe Echevarria, CEO, Deloitte\n\n\t\tGlenn Hutchins, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Silver Lake\n\n\t\tMagic Johnson, Founder and CEO, Magic Johnson Enterprises\n\n\t\tAdam Silver, Commissioner, National Basketball Association\n\n\t\tThomas Tull, Founder and CEO, Legendary Entertainment \n\nFoundation Leaders\n\n\n\t\tThe Honorable Michael R.
