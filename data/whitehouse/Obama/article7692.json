Subra has shown himself to be a consummate scientist and engineer - beholden to evidence and committed to upholding the highest scientific standards. He has also done his part to make sure the American people benefit from advances in technology, and opened up more opportunities for women, minorities, and other underrepresented groups. I am grateful for his service.\n\n\n\n\n"
