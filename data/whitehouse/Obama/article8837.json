And we know it is with the best interests of her constituents in mind that Gabby has made the tough decision to step down from Congress.\n\n\tOver the last year, Gabby and her husband Mark have taught us the true meaning of hope in the face of despair, determination in the face of incredible odds, and now – even after she’s come so far – Gabby shows us what it means to be selfless as well.\n\n\tGabby’s cheerful presence will be missed in Washington.  But she will remain an inspiration to all whose lives she touched – myself included.  And I’m confident that we haven’t seen the last of this extraordinary American.\n\n\t###\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
