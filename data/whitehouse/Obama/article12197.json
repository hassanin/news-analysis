Here in America, in cities across the country, we see the love and commitment Lithuanian Americans have for the country of their heritage and for the United States. The people of Lithuania have a strong commitment to the alliance between our two nations through NATO and our partnership to advance international security. May all those who trace their roots to Lithuania enjoy this day of celebration.\n\n\n\n\n"
