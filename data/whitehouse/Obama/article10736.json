Lew to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget\n\n\n\n\n\n\tI am pleased that Jack Lew has been confirmed, with wide bipartisan support, to serve as my next Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\t \n\tHe brings unparalleled experience and wisdom to this important job at a critical time in our nation’s history. After years of irresponsibility in Washington, we need to make the tough choices to put our country back on a sustainable fiscal path and lay the foundation for long-term job creation and economic growth. We need to cut waste where we find it and create a government that is efficient, effective, and responsive to the American people. I am confident Jack Lew can lead us in these efforts, and look forward to working with him in the days ahead.\n\n\n\n\n"
