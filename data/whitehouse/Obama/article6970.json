As our country continues to recover from serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare, however, we must maintain efforts to keep our Nation on a sustainable fiscal course. \nAccordingly, I have determined that it is appropriate to exercise my statutory alternative plan authority under 5 U.S.C. 5303(b) and 5304a to set alternative 2014 across-the-board and locality pay adjustments. Specifically, I have determined that for 2014, across-the-board pay increases will be 1.0 percent, and the current locality pay percentages shown in Schedule 9 of Executive Order 13641 of April 5, 2013, will remain at their 2013 levels. This decision will not materially affect the Federal Government's ability to attract and retain a well-qualified Federal workforce. \nThe adjustments described above shall take effect on the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2014. \nSincerely, \nBARACK OBAMA \n\n\n\n\n"
