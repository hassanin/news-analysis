And when Neil stepped foot on the surface of the moon for the first time, he delivered a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten. \n\n\tToday, Neil's spirit of discovery lives on in all the men and women who have devoted their lives to exploring the unknown - including those who are ensuring that we reach higher and go further in space. That legacy will endure - sparked by a man who taught us the enormous power of one small step.\n\n\n\n\n"
