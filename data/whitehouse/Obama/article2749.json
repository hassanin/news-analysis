This is a day to affirm the United States' abiding commitment to achieve a world without torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.\n\n\tOn my second day in office I issued an Executive Order reaffirming the United States' commitment to the universal ban on torture, and we have worked hard every day to match our words with actions.  We have owned up to past mistakes and helped advance humane treatment safeguards through the clarification and codification of our obligations.  My experience as Commander in Chief has only reinforced my conviction that, the United States must never resort to torture.  In addition to betraying our values and obligations, it would embolden repressive regimes, serve as a pretext for terrorist recruitment and violent extremism, and damage the United States' reputation as a force for good in the world.\n\n\tToday, we stand in solidarity with victims of torture around the world, and thank the many Americans who work tirelessly to achieve the goals inscribed in the Convention Against Torture.  Their work embodies the best of who we are as a nation, at the same time as it makes us stronger and more secure.\n\n\n\n\n"
