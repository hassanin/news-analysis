BECERRA: TIME TO TACKLE THE BIGGEST DEFICIT WE FACE—THE JOBS DEFICIT\n\n\tWASHINGTON, DC—Following President Barack Obama’s address to a joint session of Congress on job creation, Representative Xavier Becerra (CA-31), Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus and member of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, released the following statement:\n\n\t“President Obama is right to focus the nation’s attention on the biggest deficit we face—the jobs deficit. How can we expect to balance the nation’s checkbook when 14 million Americans are out of work and having a hard time balancing theirs?\n\n\tHistory has shown that when you invest in America by building up our schools and building out our infrastructure you create jobs and economic growth that pay the nation back many times over. And when you plant the seed of confidence in American businesses to invest in more American workers, then we can once again say that we will make it in America.\n\n\tLet’s prove the cynics and naysayers wrong and support President Obama’s effort to create jobs in America.”\n\n\n\n\n"
