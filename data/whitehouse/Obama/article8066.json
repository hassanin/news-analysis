For Muslims, Ramadan has been a time of fasting, prayer and spiritual renewal. These past four weeks have also been a time to serve the less fortunate -- a reminder of the obligations that people of all faiths have to each other.\n\n\tIn the United States, Eid-al-Fitr speaks to the truth that communities of faith -- including Muslim Americans -- enrich our national life, strengthen our democracy and uphold our freedoms, including the freedom of religion. That is why the we stand with people of all faiths, in the United States and around the world, in protecting and advancing this universal human right.\n\n\tOn behalf of the American people, we congratulate Muslim Americans and Muslims around the world on this joyous day. Eid Mubarak.\n\n\t###\n\n\n\n\n"
