Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke led the first cabinet-level trade mission to Indonesia May 25-26, promoting U.S. exports in a broad range of clean energy technologies.  Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson announced the “Breathe Easy Jakarta” initiative, partnering with the Jakarta regional government to assess and reduce key sources of urban air pollution in Jakarta.  Science Envoy Bruce Alberts explored new areas for cooperation in Science and Technology during a visit to Indonesia in May.  Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns and Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs Maria Otero visited Indonesia and engaged their Indonesian counterparts in wide-ranging strategic dialogues.\nThe U.S. Secretary of State and the Indonesian Foreign Minister will co-chair a Joint Commission later this year that will ensure continued momentum and progress on the Comprehensive Partnership.  The two Presidents will launch the Comprehensive Partnership when President Obama visits Indonesia.  In that spirit, today the two Presidents agreed to initiate major initiatives advancing Higher Education and confronting Climate Change. \nHigher Education Partnership\nThe United States will invest $165 million over five years in programs facilitating the vital exchange of leadership and management experience, scientific and technical expertise, and cultural understanding between Americans and Indonesians.  This support includes:\n\n\n\t\tExpanding of our exchange programs, including Fulbright, the Community College Initiative, and the State Department’s English-language training, student advising services, and other exchanges;\n\n\t\tLaunching a major five-year effort to improve the quality of higher education in Indonesia through a University Partnership program supporting collaboration between select U.S. and Indonesian higher education institutions;\n\n\t\tThe U.S. Government has also invited the Indonesian Minister of National Education to travel to the United States next summer for a U.S.-Indonesia Higher Education Summit to advance our cooperation in education.\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Cooperation\nThe United States recognizes President Yudhoyono’s early pledge at the G-20 in Pittsburgh to reduce Indonesia’s greenhouse gas emissions by up to 41% below business as usual by 2020, as well as Indonesia’s support for the G-20 to pledge to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies.  In order to support these pledges, the Copenhagen Accord, and our shared goals on climate change, President Obama committed $136 million over three years in an array of programs toward Environment and Climate Change cooperation, which include:\n\n\n\t\tThe $119 million SOLUSI partnership, which represents the major areas of Environment and Climate engagement—Science, Oceans, Land Use, Society and Innovation -- and means “Solution” in Indonesian.  Programs encompassed under SOLUSI include a second Tropical Forest Conservation Act agreement, Forestry and Climate Support Project (IFACS), Marine and Climate Support Program (IMACS), Clean Energy Development (ICED) program, and others.\n\n\t\tSupporting Indonesia in establishing a Climate Change Center that will work closely with national, regional, and local stakeholders in and out of government, linking science to policy on strategic priorities in the climate change area, and focusing initially on emissions from peatlands.  The United States is pleased to announce $7 million in support for the Center and $10 million for associated projects and partnerships, including public-private partnerships focused on addressing climate-related challenges in Indonesia.  Indonesia and the United States welcome Norway’s matching contribution to the Center and encourage other countries and institutions to join in its development.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
