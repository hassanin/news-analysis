The President will also announce key new partnerships in his campaign to help reach the Administration’s goal of moving American students from the middle to the top of the pack in science and math achievement over the next decade. The Vice President and Dr. Jill Biden will also attend. The event will be webcast at obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/live and is open press.\nThe President will be introduced by Barbara Stoflet of Minnetonka, Minnesota. Barbara is a recipient of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.\nBackground on the Presidential Awards:\nThe Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM), awarded each year to individuals or organizations, recognizes the crucial role that mentoring plays in the academic and personal development of students studying science or engineering and who belong to minorities that are underrepresented in those fields. Candidates for the Presidential mentoring award are nominated by colleagues, administrators, and students from their home institutions.  The mentoring can involve students at any grade level from elementary through graduate school. For biographies and a list of the teachers who received the PAESMEM and will be recognized, CLICK HERE.\nThe Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching (PAEMST)  is awarded annually to outstanding pre-college-level science and math teachers from across the country. The winners are selected by a panel of distinguished scientists, mathematicians, and educators following an initial selection process done at the state level. Each year the award alternates, going either to science and math teachers in grades K through 6 (as it is this year) or to those teaching in grades 7 through 12.
