That means providing wages people can live on, safe working conditions and real opportunities to get ahead.  Every day, the NLRB is focused on the concerns of working Americans, from eliminating unfair labor practices to upholding the right of employees to join a union and bargain collectively with their employers.  I applaud the Senate for putting in place a full board and look forward to working together on other steps we can take to grow our economy.\n\n\n\n\n"
