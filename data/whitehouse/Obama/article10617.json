The President’s willingness to change strategies by compromising on the matter of extending tax cuts to the wealthy in order to Preserve middle class tax cuts and sustain unemployment benefits was the right thing to do. In fact, I believe his decision represents the pragmatism local officials must consistently employ to make any real progress as we face the individuals our decisions impact daily.\n\n\tBeing on the ground also allows us to see the constant flow of despair that has replaced the bi-weekly paychecks for me and women who have lost their jobs and much of their confidence. Beyond the economic impact, I believe that this extension of benefits and tax cuts together will be a real morale booster for struggling families as the economy continues to rebound.”\n\n\n\n\n"
