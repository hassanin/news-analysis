Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia.  This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\n\n\t \n\n\t            BARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
