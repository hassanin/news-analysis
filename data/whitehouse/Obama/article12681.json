In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national\n\temergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the related measures blocking the property of certain persons contributing to the conflict in that country, are to continue in effect beyond October 27, 2009.\nThe situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has been marked by widespread violence and atrocities that continue to threaten regional stability, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency to deal with that threat and the related measures blocking the property of certain persons contributing to the\n\tconflict in that country.\nBARACK OBAMA\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tOctober 20, 2009.\n\t# # #\n\n\n\n\n"
