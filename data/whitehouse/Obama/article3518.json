The launch included a White House roundtable with campus and business leaders, including school presidents and students, to highlight best practices to promote sustainability and address climate change on college campuses. Additionally, a live-streamed conversation with EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy also energized young people to achieve ambitious climate goals on their campuses and push for increased global action.\n\n\tAs of December 10, 318 colleges and universities representing over 4 million students have demonstrated their commitment by joining the American Campuses Act on Climate Pledge. Modeled on the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, it complements any previous pledges or commitments institutions might have already. The pledge reads:\n\n“As institutions of higher education, we applaud the progress already made to promote clean energy and climate action as we seek a comprehensive, ambitious agreement at the upcoming United Nations Climate Negotiations in Paris. We recognize the urgent need to act now to avoid irreversible costs to our global community’s economic prosperity and public health and are optimistic that world leaders will reach an agreement to secure a transition to a low carbon future. Today our school pledges to accelerate the transition to low-carbon energy while enhancing sustainable and resilient practices across our campus.”\n\n\t \n\nSchools standing behind ACAC
