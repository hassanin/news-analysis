The two leaders agreed on the need to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the United States and Cyprus. Both leaders welcomed the appointment of UN Special Advisor Espen Barth Eide, and agreed this presented an opportunity to inject fresh energy into the settlement talks in keeping with the Joint Declaration of February 11, 2014. The Vice President and President Anastasiades discussed the potential contributions Cyprus could make with a settlement to the region's energy security. They also agreed that unifying the island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation would be in the best interest of all Cypriots.\n\n\n\n\n"
