Through cooperative efforts with the U.S. Department of Energy and the International Atomic Energy Agency, Indonesia ceased using HEU to produce Mo-99 in 2010. Indonesia is committed to continuing to provide this much-needed medical isotope and plans to restart production using LEU in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n"
