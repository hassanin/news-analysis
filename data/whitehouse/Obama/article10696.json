The President urges Congress to now pass a one-year extension to ensure seniors maintain access to the doctor they know and trust over the coming year. Passing this one-year extension is important, but it is no substitute for a long-term fix. The President has long called for a sustainable solution, and we look forward to working with Congress to further address this matter.”\n\n\n\n\n"
