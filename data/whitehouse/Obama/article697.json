On this day, let us resolve to strengthen and renew the United Nations.  Let us choose hope over fear, collaboration over division, and humanity over brutality, as we work together to build a tomorrow marked by progress rather than suffering. Our diplomacy can build the foundation for peace and our cooperation can be the catalyst for growth.  By harnessing the power of the United Nations, we can build a more peaceful and more prosperous future for all our children and grandchildren.\n\t \n\tNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2014, as United Nations Day.  I urge the Governors of the 50 States, and the officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States, to observe United Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\t \n\tIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand fourteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-ninth.\nBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
