It can provide States with references to a wide array of consolidated elements and provisions from different nuclear security conventions/treaties, as well as international legal instruments and frameworks.  The action to create a single and friendly reference kit shall involve all international organizations relevant to nuclear security, with the IAEA coordinating the task. \nAfter the 2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit, States supporting this initiative will continue to backstop and encourage the IAEA and other relevant international organizations to explore concrete ways forward to draw up the national legislation implementation kit, particularly after the 2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit.\n\n\n\n\n"
