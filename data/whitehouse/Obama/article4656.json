The President and the executives also discussed a shared desire to work with Congress to enact pro-growth, business tax reform. \nParticipants Included:\n\n\n\t\tUrsula Burns, Chairman and CEO, Xerox Corp.; Chair of Tech CEO Council\n\n\t\tMichael Dell, Chairman and CEO, Dell Inc.\n\n\t\tMark Durcan, CEO and Director, Micron Technology Inc.\n\n\t\tSteve Mollenkopf, CEO, Qualcomm Inc.\n\n\t\tGinni Rometty, Chairman, President and CEO, IBM Corp.\n\n\t\tJoe Tucci, Chairman and CEO, EMC Corp.\n\nWhite House Participants:\n\n\n\t\tValerie Jarrett, White House Senior Advisor\n\n\t\tJeff Zients, Director of the White House National Economic Council\n\n\t\tMegan Smith, Chief Technology Officer\n\n\n\n\n\n"
