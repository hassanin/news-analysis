Unfortunately, countless families – particularly military families – have been the target of these deceptive practices.\nClaims by opponents of reform that this legislation unfairly targets auto dealers are simply mistaken.  The fact is, auto dealer-lenders make nearly 80 percent of the automobile loans in our country, and these lenders should be subject to the same standards as any local or community bank that provides loans.  Auto dealer-lenders offering transparent and fair financing products to their customers should welcome these reforms, which will make their competitors who don’t play by the rules compete on a level playing field. \nWe simply cannot let lobbyist-inspired loopholes and special carve-outs weaken real reform that will empower American families.  I urge the Senate to continue to defeat the efforts of special interests to weaken protections for all American consumers. \n\n\n\n"
