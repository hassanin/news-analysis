In Congress, Charlie has fought tirelessly for a cleaner environment, Wall Street reform and more accessible health care for Texans. As Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, he has worked nonstop to deliver much needed relief to deserving immigrant families and to protect the civil rights of Latinos and all Americans. Michelle and I wish him and his family the very best and join the people of Texas in thanking him for his many years of service.\n\n\n\n\n"
