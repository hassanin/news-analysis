For the first time, tickets for the Easter Egg Roll will be distributed online so that more children and families from across the United States have the opportunity to experience this event. Tickets will no longer be distributed on the Ellipse the weekend before the event. Tickets and more information about the ticketing process will be available through obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/eastereggroll beginning on Thursday, March 26th.

The White House will open the South Lawn to children age ten and under, along with their families, to enjoy sports, cooking classes, live musical performances, storytelling and the traditional Easter egg roll. All guests will enter the event from the Ellipse and will go through a security screening process.
