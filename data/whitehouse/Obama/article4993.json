Specifically, the President convened phone calls with representitives of each of the five service branches: the Army, Air Force, Marines, Navy and Coast Guard. The President underscored to each U.S. service member that he was expressing his appreciation on Thanksgiving Day on behalf of a grateful nation. He further noted that while we were engaged in distinct missions --- from the effort to stamp out Ebola on the frontlines to helping to prosecute the campaign against ISIL --- their objective was singular: the saftey and security of the American people.\n\n\n\n\n"
