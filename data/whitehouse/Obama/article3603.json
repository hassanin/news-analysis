We can confirm that the attack has ended, and we continue to coordinate with U.S officials on the ground to verify the location of all American citizens in Mali. We extend our deep condolences to the families and loved ones of those who have been killed in this heinous attack. Our thoughts and prayers also are with those who have been injured. We commend the bravery of the Malian, French, United Nations, and U.S. security personnel who responded to the situation and prevented even worse loss of life.  The United States stands with the people of Mali and will remain a steadfast partner to the Government of Mali and others in the region fighting the terrorist groups that seek to undermine Mali’s efforts to build a durable peace following the crisis in 2012 and 2013. We are prepared to assist the Malian government in the coming days as it investigates this tragic terrorist attack.\n\n\n\n\n"
