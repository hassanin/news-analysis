Both leaders welcomed continued and increased cooperation through the Strategic Dialogue, established between our two nations last year, to address many pressing issues of mutual importance. The Vice President also lauded our bilateral partnerships in support of South Africa's commitment to increase trade and investment, counter the scourge of HIV and AIDS, improve access to education and promote agricultural development.  The Vice President and Deputy President Motlanthe discussed common efforts to meet aggressive global goals on climate change, nuclear security and nonproliferation, and to promote regional security, including progress toward peaceful outcomes in Libya, Cote D’Ivoire, Sudan and Zimbabwe.
