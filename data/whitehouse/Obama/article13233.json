I also transmit for the information of the Senate the report of the Department of State, which includes an Overview of the proposed Protocol.\n\n\tThe proposed Protocol provides for the elimination of withholding taxes on certain cross-border direct dividend payments and on cross-border interest payments to certain financial enterprises. The proposed Protocol reduces the existing Convention's 10-percent limit on withholding taxes on cross-border payments of royalties to 5 percent.\n\n\tThe proposed Protocol contains a comprehensive provision designed to prevent \"treaty shopping,\" which is the inappropriate use of a tax treaty by third-country residents. The proposed Protocol also provides for the exchange of information between tax authorities of the two countries to facilitate the administration of each country's tax laws.\n\n\tI recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the proposed Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tJune 16, 2009.\n\n\n\n\n"
