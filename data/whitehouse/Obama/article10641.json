We cannot afford to turn our backs on the unemployed and the middle class in the kind of difficult times we’re facing. This agreement also sets the stage to help businesses in our city and across the country make the necessary investments to jumpstart our economy.  It is an example of the kind of difficult but necessary choice we have to make to move forward.\"\n\n\n\n\n"
