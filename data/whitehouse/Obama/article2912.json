State, local, and tribal government leaders; and representatives of national organizations dedicated to firefighter safety and to community resilience will participate.  At the roundtable, the following announcements will be made: \n\nExecutive Order for Enhanced Wildfire Risk Mitigation in the Wildland-Urban Interface\n\n\tPresident Obama today signed an Executive Order on Wildland-Urban Interface Federal Risk Mitigation, which will mitigate wildfire risks to Federal buildings located in the WUI, reduce risks to people, and help minimize property loss to wildfire.  For new buildings and alterations to existing buildings greater than 5,000 square feet on Federal land within the WUI at moderate or greater risk to wildfire, the Executive Order directs Federal agencies to apply wildfire-resistant design provisions delineated in the 2015 edition of the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code (IWUIC) promulgated by the International Code Council (ICC), or an equivalent code.  These codes, which encompass the current understanding of wildfire hazard potential, will help increase safety and protect the lives of people who live or work in these buildings. \n\nCommitment Statement\n\n\tFederal, State, local, tribal and non-Government leaders from over 39 agencies and jurisdictions have committed to a multi-scale, collaborative approach to address the challenges posed by wildfire in wildland-urban interface and to the following statement:\n\nAs Federal, State, local, tribal and non-Government leaders, we recognize the challenges of managing fire in the wildland-urban interface, including the increased complexity of fire response, air quality and public health impacts, and loss of community infrastructure and cultural resources.  The consequences of a changing climate intensify these challenges, resulting in more severe wildfires threatening the well-being of our communities, and jeopardizing the safety of our first responders and the public they serve.\n\nWe are committed to safely and effectively extinguishing fire, when needed; using fire where allowable; managing our natural resources; and as a Nation, living with wildland fire safely.  We are committed to advancing community resilience in the wildland-urban interface, managing the adjacent landscapes wisely, and continuing to improve the efficiency of wildland fire response.  We are committed to a multi-scale, collaborative approach to address the challenges posed by wildfire in the wildland-urban interface. \n\nBuilding Resilience and Sustainability\n\n\tThe effort to mitigate wildfire risk to Federal facilities is part of a broader set of initiatives to build resilience throughout the Federal government, with State, local, and tribal leaders, and with non-governmental partners.  Recent Federal resilience initiatives have focused on flood risk management, seismic early warning, long-term drought resilience, advocating for climate-smart building codes and standards, and a number of technical assistance programs to partner with communities to enhance sustainability and resilience.  Together with Federal sustainability initiatives to promote clean energy and lower greenhouse gas emissions across the Federal family, these actions help prepare us for those climate impacts that are too late to avoid. \n\n\n\n\n"
