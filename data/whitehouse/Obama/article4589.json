American officials are in touch with Tunisian authorities, and the United States is prepared to offer assistance to their investigation.  \nWhile we do not yet know the identities of the attackers or their motives, what we do know is that their cowardly acts will not intimidate the Tunisian people, whose storied heritage is showcased at the site of this attack, the National Bardo Museum. The United States is proud of our robust cooperation with Tunisia on counterterrorism and broader security issues, and we will continue to stand with our Tunisian partners against terrorist violence. \n\n\n\n\n"
