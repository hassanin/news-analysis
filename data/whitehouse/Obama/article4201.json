The Vice President emphasized the Obama Administration’s ongoing support for efforts by Central American governments to address the economic and social factors contributing to increases in illicit migration to the United States. The Vice President and President Hernandez reviewed joint efforts to tackle corruption, target transnational criminal networks, and promote economic prosperity and opportunity in Honduras. Specifically on energy, the Vice President emphasized the urgency of continuing implementation on Honduran energy reform and of addressing obstacles to the development of a regional energy market that would provide lower energy prices for the citizens of Central America. The Vice President also discussed the Administration’s $1 billion Fiscal Year 2016 request to Congress for Central America and underscored the importance of working closely with Congress to craft a comprehensive package that addresses the region’s underlying security, developmental, and institutional challenges. \n\n\n\n\n"
