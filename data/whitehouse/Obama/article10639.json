I applaud him for working with Republicans to achieve a bipartisan agreement,\" Senator Conrad said.\n\n\t\"What really matters is what comes next.  There needs to be a comprehensive plan to deal with America's deficit and the debt long-term. At its core, this plan must involve fundamental tax reform.  That is what the deficit commission recommended — along with spending cuts — as a way to tackle the nation's debt,\" Senator Conrad said.  \"We must now work to put in place a long-term deficit reduction plan that restores confidence in America's fiscal future.\"\n\n\n\n\n"
