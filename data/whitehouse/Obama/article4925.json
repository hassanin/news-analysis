The Vice President discussed the President’s historic changes to U.S. Cuba policy, including re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba; facilitating travel and increasing remittances; increasing U.S. participation in Cuba’s telecommunications sector; and easing restrictions on providing U.S. goods and services to Cubans in third countries. The Vice President informed President Peña Nieto that the United States would also pursue discussions with the Cuban and Mexican governments to address the unresolved maritime boundary in the Gulf of Mexico. Further, the Vice President conveyed the President’s intent to participate in the April 2015 Summit of the Americas in Panama as long as Cuban civil society is allowed to participate and human rights and democracy form part of the Summit agenda. Both President Santos and President Peña Nieto applauded the President’s courage in charting a new course in U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean, and committed to supporting the initiative.\n\n\n\n\n"
