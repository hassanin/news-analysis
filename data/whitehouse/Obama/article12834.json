As Press Secretary to President Carter, Jody served his country during a difficult time, and he always did the job with grace and good humor. When I needed advice at the start of my own tenure as Press Secretary, he was always generous with his time and wise in his counsel. I’ll miss his support and encouragement, and I’ll be keeping him and his family in my thoughts and prayers.\"\n\n\n\n"
