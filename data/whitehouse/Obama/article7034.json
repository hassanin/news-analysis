Our cooperation on these issues remains a priority for the United States, so on Friday, August 9, Secretaries Hagel and Kerry will meet with their Russian counterparts in a 2+2 format in Washington to discuss how we can best make progress moving forward on the full range of issues in our bilateral relationship.\nThe President still looks forward to traveling to St. Petersburg on September 5-6 to attend the G-20 Summit.\n\n\n\n\n"
