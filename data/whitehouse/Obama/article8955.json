The United States remains fully committed to pursuing ratification of the Test Ban Treaty and will continue to engage members of the Senate on the importance of this Treaty to U.S. security.   America must lead the global effort to prevent proliferation, and adoption and early entry into force of the CTBT is a vital part of that effort.\n\n\n\n\n"
