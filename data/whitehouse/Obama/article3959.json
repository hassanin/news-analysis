Rice on the South Sudan Peace Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe United States welcomes President Kiir’s decision to accept the terms of peace and sign the regionally-sponsored peace agreement today in South Sudan.  However, we do not recognize any reservations or addendums to that agreement.  The United States believes this is the necessary first step toward ending the conflict and rebuilding the country.  Now the hard work begins.  Implementing this agreement will require commitment and resolve from all parties to the conflict as well as South Sudan’s regional and international partners.  The United States will support the people of South Sudan as they begin the implementation process, but it is imperative that the parties remain committed to peace.  We will work with our international partners to sideline those who stand in the way of peace, drawing upon the full range of our multilateral and bilateral tools.\n\n\tThe United States is grateful for the constructive role played by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the African Union to secure an agreement.  Together, we must help South Sudan implement the agreement, to stave off famine, to stand steadfast and united against those who block the path to peace, and to hold accountable those who have committed atrocities.  At this moment of opportunity, the United States stands in solidarity with the people of South Sudan, and with all those working to build the peaceful future that they so deserve. \n\n\n\n\n"
