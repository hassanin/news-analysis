    "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary\n\n\nFor Immediate Release\nJuly 22, 2016\n\n \n\n\n\nStatement by the President on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\tToday, I signed S.524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 into law.  This legislation includes some modest steps to address the opioid epidemic.   Given the scope of this crisis, some action is better than none.  \n\n\tHowever, I am deeply disappointed that Republicans failed to provide any real resources for those seeking addiction treatment to get the care that they need.  In fact, they blocked efforts by Democrats to include $920 million in treatment funding. \n\n\tEvery day, 78 Americans die from opioid overdoses.  I have heard from too many families across the country whose lives have been shattered by this epidemic, including a mom from Ohio who recently wrote: “There are not near enough facilities in this area to handle the amount of care that is needed… We need help.”\n\n\tMy Administration has been doing everything we can to increase access to treatment, and I’m going to continue fighting to secure the funding families desperately need.  In recent days, the law enforcement community, advocates, physicians, and elected officials from both sides of the aisle have also joined in this call.  Now, it’s up to Republicans to finish the job and provide adequate funding to deal with this public health crisis.  That’s what the American people deserve.\n\n\n\n\n"
