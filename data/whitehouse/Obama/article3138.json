This is a time to remember the sacrifices made for us and hold all who suffer close to our hearts.  Yet it is also a time to rejoice, give thanks for the Resurrection, and unite with Christians around the world in proclaiming, \"Christ has risen; He has risen indeed.\"  We wish all who celebrate a blessed and joyful Easter.\n\n\n\n"
