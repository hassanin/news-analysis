The United States will work with him and the Japanese people on initiatives that benefit our two countries, the region, and the world.  For the last half-century the U.S.-Japan Alliance has served as the linchpin of peace and security in the Asia Pacific region and, together, we can ensure that the next half-century enjoys the same stability and prosperity.  The relationship between the United States and Japan is based on common interests and common values, and I look forward to working with Prime Minister Noda to tackle the broad range of economic and security issues that require our attention.\n\n\n\n\n"
