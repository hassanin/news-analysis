This holiday reminds us all that we should commit ourselves to helping those in need.  For many, this is also a time to gather with family and to pray.  To those celebrating Diwali in India, I look forward to visiting you over the next few days.  And to all those who will celebrate this joyous occasion on Friday, I wish you, your families and loved ones Happy Diwali and Saal Mubarak. \n\n\n\n\n"
