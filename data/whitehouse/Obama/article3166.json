The President reviewed our ongoing efforts to normalize relations with Cuba. The President highlighted the recent regulatory changes made by the Departments of the Treasury and Commerce, and the impact those changes would have on the ability of Americans to travel to Cuba and engage directly with the Cuban people. He also reiterated that while in Havana, he will meet with the Cuban government, Cuban entrepreneurs, and Cuban independent civil society. He emphasized that improving the lives of the Cuban people is a central focus of our policy, including access to increased opportunity, connectivity, and our enduring support for human rights -- including respect for the right to speak freely, peacefully assembly, and associate. The President noted that he will continue to consult closely with the Cuban-Americans, who represent our values and shared aspirations for a better future for the American and Cuban people.\n\n\t \n\n\tThe following individuals attended the meeting:\n\n\nEmilio Estefan, Founder, Estefan Enterprises Inc.\n\nMike Fernandez, Founder, MBF Healthcare Partners\n\nAngela Freyre, General Counsel, Export-Import Bank\n\nFelice Gorordo, Founder, Roots of Hope\n\nCarlos Gutierrez, Partner, Albright Stonebridge Group\n\nFather Fernando Heria, Miami Catholic Priest and Judge of the Tribunal to Consenso Cubano, St. Brendan Catholic Church \n\nRic Herrero, Executive Director, #CubaNow\n\nConsuelo Isaacson, President, Friends of Caritas Cubana\n\nJorge Mas, Chairman and Co-Founder, MasTec\n\nAlejandro Mayorkas, Deputy Secretary, Department of Homeland Security\n\nJohn McIntire, Chairman, Cuba Emprende Foundation\n\nRalph Patino, Founder of Patino & Associates\n\nAriel Pereda, Chair, Engage Cuba Business Council\n\nCarlos Saladrigas, Chairman, Cuba Study Group\n\nMicho Spring, Chair of Global Corporate Practice, Weber Shandwick\n\nSilvia Wilhelm, Executive Director, Puentos Cubanos\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
