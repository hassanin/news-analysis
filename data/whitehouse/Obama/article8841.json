Prior to his time in office, Maurice proudly served his country as a member of the United States Navy.  He then went on to serve as a member in the state assembly for eighteen years, followed by ten consecutive terms as a U.S. Representative for the 22nd Congressional District of New York.  Throughout his career Maurice has been a champion for the middle class, leading the charge for renewable energy and Wall Street reform and working tirelessly to get Americans back to work.  Michelle and I join the people of New York in thanking Congressman Hinchey for his service.\n\n\n\n\n"
