The Vice President underscored that G-7 Leaders have clearly called for Russia to stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border and to exercise its influence among the separatists to lay down their weapons and renounce violence, both of which Russia has thus far failed to do. The Vice President noted that the United States would work with our partners to impose further costs on Russia if it continued on its current course. The two leaders pledged to stay in touch in the run-up to the European Union leaders meeting on June 27.\n\n\n\n\n"
