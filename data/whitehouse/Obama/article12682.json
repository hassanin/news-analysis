The President took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has been marked by widespread violence and atrocities that continue to threaten regional stability.\nBecause this situation continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States,the national emergency declared on October 27, 2006, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency,must continue in effect beyond October 27, 2009. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13413.\n\tThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\nBARACK OBAMA\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tOctober 20, 2009.\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
