Governments have a special responsibility to make proper rules and promote good governance. Fair taxes, increased transparency and open trade are vital drivers of this.  We will make a real difference by doing the following:\n\n\nTax authorities across the world should automatically share information to fight the scourge of tax evasion.\n\n\nCountries should change rules that let companies shift their profits across borders to avoid taxes, and multinationals should report to tax authorities what tax they pay where.\n\n\nCompanies should know who really owns them and tax collectors and law enforcers should be able to obtain this information easily.\n\n\nDeveloping countries should have the information and capacity to collect the taxes owed them – and other countries have a duty to help them.\n\n\nExtractive companies should report payments to all governments - and governments should publish income from such companies.\n\n\nMinerals should be sourced legitimately, not plundered from conflict zones.\n\n\nLand transactions should be transparent, respecting the property rights of local communities.\n\n\nGovernments should roll back protectionism and agree new trade deals that boost jobs and growth worldwide.\n\n\nGovernments should cut wasteful bureaucracy at borders and make it easier and quicker to move goods between developing countries.\n\n\nGovernments should publish information on laws, budgets, spending, national statistics, elections and government contracts in a way that is easy to read and re-use, so that citizens can hold them to account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
