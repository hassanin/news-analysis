Part of that promise included deploying a nationwide, interoperable broadband network for our first responders. Today we made good on that overdue promise.  First responders put their lives on the line to protect us every day, and the least we can do is ensure that they have the dedicated bandwidth they need to communicate with each other.  It’s going to save lives and help keep our neighborhoods safe.\n\n\n\n\n"
