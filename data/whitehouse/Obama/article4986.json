The Ukrainian people demonstrated their clear preference for democracy, political and economic reform, and self-determination at the ballot box during the October 26 parliamentary elections. Today’s announcement on the formation of a new government sets the stage for the difficult but necessary process of implementing reforms and delivering results. The United States will support Ukraine’s new government to stabilize its economy, strengthen democratic institutions, and fight corruption. We will also continue to stand for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression, and support the aspirations of Ukraine’s citizens for a secure, democratic, prosperous, European future.\n\n\n\n\n"
