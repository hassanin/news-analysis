Six working groups have been tasked with coordinating strategies and highlighting policy initiatives and priorities under the Plan of Action.  These groups focus on energy, security, trade and investment, democracy and civil society, education, and climate and environment.\nThe U.S. Secretary of State and the Indonesian Foreign Minister co-chair a Joint Commission to ensure continued momentum to sustain the Partnership.  Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Natalegawa held the inaugural session in Washington, D.C. in September 2010; the second session was convened in Bali on July 24, 2011.  The next meeting will be held in 2012.\nSenior-level dialogue is a key element of the Partnership, including a strategic dialogue Launched by Deputy Secretary Burns, in his previous capacity as Under Secretary, and Director General Marsudi in July 2010. Since the launch of the Comprehensive Partnership the United States and Indonesia have established high-level dialogues on commercial ties, energy policy, health, and trade and investment.  Additional high-level dialogues will be added as the two countries further develop the Comprehensive Partnership.\n\n\n\n\n"
