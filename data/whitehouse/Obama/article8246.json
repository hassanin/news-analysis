We will also continue to support efforts like the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture.  \n\n\tWe know that much work needs to be done as the international community moves toward its goal of eliminating torture.  Until then, the United States will continue to seek an end to cruel and inhuman treatment.\n\n\n\n\n"
