This is an important step towards enacting a key provision of the Presidentâ€™s American Jobs Act and a significant victory for the American people and the economy, because as independent analysts have said, failing to extend this tax cut would have had a damaging effect on our recovery and job growth. The President urges Congress now to finish up their business for the American people.\n\n\n\n\n"
