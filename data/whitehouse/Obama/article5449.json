Rice on Iraq\n\n\n\n\nToday, Iraqis took another major step forward in uniting their country.  We commend Prime Minister Maliki for his decision to support Prime Minister-designate Haider al-Abadi in his efforts to form a new government in line with the Iraqi constitution.  We have heard from a wide range of leaders across the Iraqi political spectrum who have expressed their commitment to work with Dr. Abadi to form a broad, inclusive government with an agenda that can address the needs and legitimate aspirations of the Iraqi people.  In the last few days, we have also welcomed statements of support from all over the world for the new Prime Minister-designate.  These are encouraging developments that we hope can set Iraq on a new path and unite its people against the threat presented by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.  The United States remains committed to a strong partnership with Iraq and the Iraqi people.\n\n\n\n\n"
