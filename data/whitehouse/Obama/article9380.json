In Harry Truman-style – straight from the heart – the President was both inspirational and specific.\n\n\t“I particularly support his call for rebuilding our deficient roads, bridges and schools and for helping homeowners refinance – issues that I have been working with my Republican colleagues to address.\n\n\t“I will work on a bipartisan basis to pass the American Jobs Act.”\n\n\n\n\n"
