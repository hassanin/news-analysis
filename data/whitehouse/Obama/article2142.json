This year’s recipients are employed or funded by the following departments and agencies: Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of the Interior, Department of Veterans Affairs, Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, and the Intelligence Community. These departments and agencies join together annually to nominate the most meritorious scientists and engineers whose early accomplishments show the greatest promise for assuring America’s preeminence in science and engineering and contributing to the awarding agencies' missions.\n\t \n\tThe awards, established by President Clinton in 1996, are coordinated by the Office of Science and Technology Policy within the Executive Office of the President. Awardees are selected for their pursuit of innovative research at the frontiers of science and technology and their commitment to community service as demonstrated through scientific leadership, public education, or community outreach.\n\t \n\tThe newest recipients are:\n\t \nDepartment of Agriculture\n\tMichelle Cilia, USDA Agricultural Research Service\n\tPankaj Lal, Montclair State University\n\tMichael Ulyshen, USDA Forest Service\n \n\tDepartment of Commerce\n\tNicholas Butch, NIST Center for Neutron Research\n\tMandy Karnauskas, NOAA Fisheries\n\tAnne Perring, University of Colorado, Boulder\n\tCorey Potvin, University of Oklahoma\n\tJohn Teufel, NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory\n\tJustin Zook, NIST Material Measurement Laboratory\n\t \nDepartment of Defense\n\tMichael Bell, Colorado State University\n\tNurcin Celik, University of Miami\n\tKaushik Chowdhury, Northeastern University\n\tShawn Douglas, University of California, San Francisco\n\tChristopher Dyer, DeepMind and Carnegie Mellon University\n\tAaron Esser-Kahn, University of California, Irvine\n\tSinan Keten, Northwestern University\n\tJonathan Fan, Stanford University\n\tDanna Freedman, Northwestern University\n\tThomas Harris, Northwestern University\n\tDavid Hsieh, California Institute of Technology\n\tOsama Nayfeh, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center-Pacific\n\tOlukayode Okusaga, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory \n\tJoseph Parker, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory \n\tAdam Pilchak, Air Force Research Laboratory \n\tHarris Wang, Columbia University\n\t \nDepartment of Education\n\tDaphna Bassok, University of Virginia\n\tShayne Piasta, The Ohio State University\n\t \nDepartment of Energy\n\tJonathan Belof, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\n\tCarl Dahl, Northwestern University\n\tEric Duoss, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\n\tAnna Grassellino, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory\n\tJacqueline Hakala, National Energy Technology Laboratory\n\tStephanie Hansen, Sandia National Laboratories\n\tKory Hedman, Arizona State University\n\tAlan Kruizenga, Sandia National Laboratories\n\tWei Li, Rice University\n\tGuglielmo Scovazzi, Duke University\n\tMichael Tonks, Penn State University\n\tJenny Yang, University of California, Irvine\n\tJohn Yeager, Los Alamos National Laboratory\n\t \nDepartment of Health and Human Services\n\tGregory Alushin, Rockefeller University\n\tManish Arora, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai\n\tDawn Cornelison, University of Missouri\n\tKashmira Date, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\tCraig Duvall, Vanderbilt University\n\tNicholas Gilpin, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center \n\tAnna Greka, Brigham and Women's Hospital\n\tPamela Guerrerio, National Institutes of Health\n\tGery Guy, Jr., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\tChristine Hendon, Columbia University\n\tCatherine Karr, University of Washington\n\tMaria Lehtinen, Boston Children's Hospital\n\tAdriana Lleras-Muney, University of California, Los Angeles\n\tMary Kay Lobo, University of Maryland School of Medicine\n\tMichael McAlpine, University of Minnesota\n\tEric Morrow, Brown University \n\tDaniel O'Connor, Johns Hopkins University\n\tAimee Shen, Tufts University\n\tCui Tao, University of Texas\n\tJacquelyn Taylor, Yale School of Nursing\n\tBenjamin Voight, University of Pennsylvania\n\tMatthew Wheeler, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\tBlake Wiedenheft, Montana State University\n\t   \nDepartment of Interior\n\tNathaniel Hitt, U.S. Geological Survey\n\tSarah Minson, U.S. Geological Survey\n\tDiann Prosser, U.S. Geological Survey\n\t \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n\tAdam Rose, RAND Corporation and Boston Medical Center\n\tNasia Safdar, Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital\n\tJoshua Yarrow, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\n\t \n\tEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\tHavala Pye, Environmental Protection Agency\n\tSala Senkayi, Environmental Protection Agency\n\t \nIntelligence Community\n\tMatthew Dicken, U.S. Army\n\tJosiah Dykstra, National Security Agency\n\tJames Kang, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\n\tJason Matheny, Office of the Director of National Intelligence\n\tDavid Moehring, IonQ, Inc.\n\tR.
