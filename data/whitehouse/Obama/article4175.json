Outside initiative. The Campout is co-sponsored by the U.S. Department of the Interior and will celebrate the National Park Service Centennial as well as June being Great Outdoors Month. The Campout will take place in one of the most historic backyards and National Parks in the Nation – the White House South Lawn.\n\n\tAs Honorary National President of Girl Scouts of the USA, the First Lady will welcome fifty fourth-grade Girl Scouts to participate in activities to earn the new Girls’ Choice Outdoor badges. The Girl Scouts will engage in both new and traditional outdoor activities, including rock wall climbing, knot tying, orienteering, and tent pitching. Later that evening, the participants will be joined by NASA astronaut Cady Coleman, who will join a stargazing activity led by NASA staff and scientists on the South Lawn before the girls settle in for the night.\n\nLet’s Move! Outside was created to encourage kids and families to take advantage of America’s great outdoors—which abound in every city, town, and community. Through public-private partnerships and in conjunction with all levels of government, the Department of Interior leads Let’s Move! Outside to inspire millions of young people to play, learn, serve and work outdoors.\n\n\tAs part of the centennial celebration of the National Park Service, in which the First Lady serves as honorary co-chair, President Obama launched the “Every Kid in a Park” initiative. This new initiative calls on each of our agencies to help get all children to visit and enjoy the outdoors and inspire a new generation of Americans to experience their country’s unrivaled public lands and waters. Starting in September, every fourth-grader in the nation will receive an “Every Kid in a Park” pass that’s good for free admission to all of America’s federal lands and waters -- for them and their families -- for a full year.\n\n\tThe following Girl Scouts Councils will participate in the White House Campout:\n\n\n\t\tGirl Scouts of Central Maryland, from Baltimore, M.D.\n\n\t\tGirl Scouts of Black Diamond Council, from West Virginia\n\n\t\tGirl Scouts of Virginia Skyline Council, from southern Virginia\n\n\t\tGirl Scouts Nation’s Capital, from Washington D.C.\n\n\t\tGirl Scouts of Eastern Oklahoma\n\n\n\n\n\n"
