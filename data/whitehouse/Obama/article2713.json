We remain in contact with Bangladeshi authorities and have offered any assistance necessary. This heinous attack resulted in as many as 20 deaths, including an American citizen, Bangladeshi law enforcement personnel, and citizens of several other nations. Our deepest condolences go out to the families and loved ones of those killed, and we hope for a speedy recovery for those wounded. This is a despicable act of terrorism, and the United States stands with Bangladesh and the international community in our resolve to confront terrorism wherever it occurs.\n\n\n\n\n"
