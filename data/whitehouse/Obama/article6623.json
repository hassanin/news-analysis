IMCP specifically brings together the resources of multiple federal departments and agencies involved in economic development.\nIn Phase One of the of the ‘Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership,’ 44 communities were awarded a total of $7 million to support the creation of economic development strategies that recognize the community’s comparative advantages as a place to do business, invest in public goods, and encourage collaboration between multiple entities to expand the area’s commercial appeal to investors.\nToday, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker announced that the competition for Phase Two of the ‘Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership’ is now open, and the Federal Register Notice will be posted in the coming days. In this phase, communities will have an opportunity to compete for a special designation that will elevate them in consideration for $1.3 billion in federal dollars and assistance from 10 cabinet departments/agencies. These communities could also potentially receive catalytic additional federal investments to further support their economic development strategies. The IMCP is a critical component of the Department of Commerce’s “Open for Business Agenda,” which prioritizes trade and investment.\nPhase Two of the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership\nIn Phase Two of the IMCP, up to 12 communities that come up with winning strategies will receive a designation of “Manufacturing Community” that gives them elevated consideration for $1.3 billion in federal dollars and assistance from 10 cabinet departments/agencies. These communities would also potentially receive additional catalytic federal investments to support their economic development strategies. In order to earn the designation, communities must present strategies that identify technologies or industries in which they would be competitive in the future and would make investments in the following areas:\n\n\n\t\tworkforce and training;\n\n\t\tadvanced research;\n\n\t\tinfrastructure and site development;\n\n\t\tsupply chain support;\n\n\t\texport promotion;\n\n\t\tand capital access \n\nThese communities will receive:\n\n\n\t\tElevated consideration for federal dollars and assistance across 10 cabinet departments/agencies, totaling $1.3 billion;\n\n\t\tA dedicated federal liaison at these agencies who can act as their concierge to the specific services they need;\n\n\t\tSubject to funding availability, challenge grants may become available to some awardees from the pool of designated manufacturing communities;\n\n\t\tRecognition on a government website, accessible to prospective private investors (foreign and domestic alike) looking for information on communities’ competitive attributes \n\nIMCP Competition Process\n\n\n\t\tPhase One: The Administration and the Department of Commerce have already awarded 44 communities with $200,000 planning grants – a total of $7 million. \n\n\t\tPhase Two: Communities must apply by March 14, 2014 to be considered. Eligibility for Phase 2 is not contingent on having won Phase 1.\n\n\t\tDetails on additional phases of the IMCP are forthcoming. \n\nIMCP Participating Agencies (Either through Phase One or Phase Two) \n\n\n\t\tDepartment of Agriculture\n\n\t\tDepartment of Commerce, Economic Development Administration\n\n\t\tDepartment of Defense\n\n\t\tDepartment of Education\n\n\t\tDepartment of Energy\n\n\t\tDepartment of Housing and Urban Development\n\n\t\tDepartment of Labor, Employment and Training Administration\n\n\t\tDepartment of Transportation\n\n\t\tAppalachian Regional Commission\n\n\t\tDelta Regional Authority\n\n\t\tEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\n\t\tNational Science Foundation\n\nSmall Business Administration\n\n\n\n\n"
