Res. 22, a resolution that would nullify a rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army to clarify the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act.  The rule, which is a product of extensive public involvement and years of work, is critical to our efforts to protect the Nation's waters and keep them clean; is responsive to calls for rulemaking from the Congress, industry, and community stakeholders; and is consistent with decisions of the United States Supreme Court.    \n\n\tWe must protect the waters that are vital for the health of our communities and the success of our businesses, agriculture,and energy development.  As I have noted before, too many of our waters have been left vulnerable.  Pollution from upstream sources ends up in the rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and coastal waters near which most Americans live and on which they depend for their drinking water, recreation, and economic development. Clarifying the scope of the Clean Water Act helps to protect these resources and safeguard public health.  Because this resolution seeks to block the progress represented by this rule and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty and clarity needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water, I cannot support it.  I am therefore vetoing this resolution.\n\n\tBarack Obama\n\tThe White House\n\tJanuary 19, 2016​\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
