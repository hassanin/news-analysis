Beginning on July 14, 2016, up to approximately 200 U.S. Armed Forces with appropriate combat equipment, including those forces initially pre-positioned in Djibouti, are pre-positioning in Uganda for this purpose.\n\n\tIt is not possible to know at this time the precise scope or the duration of the deployments of U.S. Armed Forces necessary to support the security of U.S. citizens and property in South Sudan.\n\n\tI have directed this action consistent with my responsibility to protect U.S. citizens both at home and abroad, and in furtherance of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.\n\n\tI am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148). I appreciate the support of the Congress in these actions.\n\n\tSincerely,\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
