The number of households unprepared for digital television has been cut in half.  Still, some people are not ready.  I want to be clear: there will not be another delay.  I urge everyone who is not yet prepared to act today, so you don’t lose important news and emergency information on June 12.   And I encourage all Americans who are prepared, to talk to their friends, family, and neighbors to make sure they get ready before it’s too late.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
