High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross to conduct protection activities and provide multi-sectoral assistance to refugees, IDPs, and conflict affected populations throughout CAR. \n\n\nConflict Mitigation, Reconciliation and Peacebuilding\nPresident Obama spoke directly to the people of CAR in an audio message to underscore the importance of reconciliation between its people.  We support efforts to help prevent further violence and improve understanding and tolerance between the CAR’s varied communities, ethnic groups, and religions.  The United States will provide the following assistance:\n\n\nSubject to Congressional notification, nearly $7.5 million in funding to support conflict mitigation, reconciliation and peacebuilding, including interreligious peacebuilding efforts and using community radio to amplify peace messages and dispel rumors, through the Complex Crises Fund and the Human Rights Grants Fund. \n\n\n$125,000 in funding from the State Department to create a network of local community and interfaith religious leaders to promote peace, conflict mitigation, and reconciliation efforts.  \n\n\nOngoing community protection and conflict mitigation work in areas in CAR affected by the Lord’s Resistance Army. \n\n\nJustice and Accountability\nAccountability for perpetrators who have committed atrocities is critical to ensuring justice for victims and to breaking the cycle of violence.  The United States welcomes the U.N. Secretary General’s creation of the Commission of Inquiry as called for in UN Security Council Resolution 2127.  The United States will support accountability in the CAR by:\n\n\nSupporting the work of the Commission of Inquiry by sharing information, as appropriate, and providing technical assistance and advice to the United Nations on the establishment of the COI. \n\n\nAdvising CAR leaders to assist them holding perpetrators of atrocities to account. \n\n\nEnsuring access to justice for women survivors of sexual and gender based violence.  For the past two years, the State Department has provided nearly $300,000 to fund partner organizations to support access to justice for survivors of gender-based violence, including through providing legal and psychosocial support, and community outreach.  These programs have served over 6,000 survivors of gender based violence thus far and the State Department will continue that support.  The State Department will provide an additional $200,000 to extend this program by a year.  \n\n\nEnhanced U.S. Presence\nThe United States recognizes the importance of a sustained presence in the CAR to help support humanitarian assistance, MISCA and French efforts to restore security, the political process leading to free and fair elections, conflict prevention, reconciliation, and accountability.\nWe will increase our presence through regular visits, including an interagency assessment trip led by USAID Assistant Administrator for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs, Nancy Lindborg, in January.  Our increased rotational presence will include humanitarian assistance, reconciliation, peacebuilding and political transition experts, who will support our efforts to help the people of CAR.  And we will move to reopen our Embassy in Bangui as security conditions allow.\n\n\n\n\n"
