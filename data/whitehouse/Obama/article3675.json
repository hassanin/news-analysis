But still, in communities across the country, 10.5 million people eligible for Marketplace coverage remain uninsured.\n\n\tToday, we are launching the White House “Healthy Communities Challenge” to engage key communities with large numbers or high percentages of uninsured in states across the country where strong federal, state and community collaboration can have a meaningful impact on reaching the uninsured. Through this challenge, we are calling on community leadership to build outreach efforts to reach these remaining uninsured and help them gain coverage. \n\n\tAt the end of this third open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), along with State-based Marketplaces, will publish tallies of new Marketplace signups in participating communities. These tallies will be compared to HHS estimates of the number of eligible uninsured people at the start of open enrollment to see which communities made the most progress during the challenge. \n\n\tThe victorious community gets bragging rights, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success in helping ensure every American has health coverage.\n\n\tBased on particularly high opportunity for impact, the White House reached out to local officials in each of these 20 communities, including Mayor Robert Garcia, who embraced the “Healthy Communities Challenge” to get their uninsured constituents covered.\n\nLong Beach Health Insurance Marketplace for 2016\n\n\nHealth insurance coverage is affordable. On June 30, 2015, 1,393,567 people in California were covered through its Health Insurance Exchange, or Marketplace.  \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tThe average monthly premium in California will increase by 4 percent from 2015 to 2016 before tax credits.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe average monthly premium in the Southwest Region of Los Angeles County for the lowest cost silver plan will decrease by 4.5 percent from 2015 to 2016 before tax credits.\n\n\t\t\t\tTax credits matter. In 2015, 88 percent of Marketplace enrollees – 1,227,770 people – in California received a tax credit, and consumers saved an average of $302 per month.\n\n\n\nConsumers have a choice. \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn California, 12 issuers are offering individual health plans in the Marketplace in 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\tIn the Southwest Region of Los Angeles County, 6 issuers are offering individual health plans in the Marketplace in 2016.\n\n\n\nIt pays to shop. \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn the Southwest Region of Los Angeles County, Marketplace consumers who switch to the lowest-cost plan within a coverage level in 2016 will see a 15.5 percent decrease in premiums on average.\n\n\n\nWhile progress has been made, more work is needed to cover the uninsured.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIn California, the adult uninsured rate dropped from 21.6 percent in 2013 to 11.8 percent in the first half of 2015.\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Long Beach and the surrounding region, there are 480,000 uninsured who are eligible for the Marketplace. (The number of the uninsured is for the Designated Market Area that includes Long Beach.)\n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\nCommunities Participating in the “Healthy Communities Challenge”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t         Dallas, TX\n\n\t\t\t\t         Tampa, FL\n\n\t\t\t\t         Atlanta, GA\n\n\t\t\t\t         Seattle, WA\n\n\t\t\t\t         Great Falls, MT\n\n\t\t\t\t         Salt Lake City, UT\n\n\t\t\t\t         Kansas City, MO\n\n\t\t\t\t         Chicago, IL\n\n\t\t\t\t         Phoenix, AZ\n\n\t\t\t\t         Detroit, MI\n\n\t\t\t\t         Charlotte, NC\n\n\t\t\t\t         Nashville, TN\n\n\t\t\t\t         New Orleans, LA\n\n\t\t\t\t         Denver, CO\n\n\t\t\t\t         Milwaukee, WI\n\n\t\t\t\t         Philadelphia, PA\n\n\t\t\t\t         Las Vegas, NV\n\n\t\t\t\t         Oakland, CA\n\n\t\t\t\t         Richmond, VA\n\n\t\t\t\t         Long Beach, CA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
