Through this partnership, solar hybrid is replacing diesel as a rural power source that could have broader applications in other rural markets.\n\n\t\tClean drinking water: Water membranes manufactured by Minnesota-based Pentair Filtration Systems are being used by Piramal’s Sarvajal to develop sustainable drinking water solutions for rural and urban populations where water quality currently causes more than 70 percent of common health problems.\n\n\t\tDrug discovery: The Epic System, an optical biosensor technology developed and manufactured by Upstate New York’s Corning Incorporated, is being used in partnership with Advinus Therapeutics for the development of new therapies for a variety of diseases, including ‘neglected’ diseases such as leshmaniasis, a parasite that disables tens of thousands Indians each year and is a growing threat to American service members in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n\n\tAlso present in the room will be a group of fifteen young entrepreneurs who are spearheading initiatives that are creating jobs and improving the delivery of basic services – health care, education, clean water, power, financial services – through market-based strategies that benefit low-income communities.  With nearly 65 percent of India’s 1.2 billion citizens under the age of 35, these individuals embody our shared belief in democracy and economic growth as central elements to greater poverty alleviation.\n\n\n\n\n"
