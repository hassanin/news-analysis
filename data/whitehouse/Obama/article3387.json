The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, in coordination with the Department of State, previously issued amended regulations to support the President's policy of empowering the Cuban people and creating conditions for more economic opportunities between Cubans and Americans.  Today, these agencies have announced additional regulatory changes to build on that progress.  These changes will remove financing restrictions for most types of authorized exports, amend regulations to increase support for the Cuban people and facilitate authorized exports, and further facilitate authorized travel.  Just as the United States is doing its part to remove impediments that have been holding Cubans back, we urge the Cuban government to make it easier for its citizens to start businesses, engage in trade, and access information online.\n\n\tEngagement and purposeful steps like those announced today will continue to empower the Cuban people and advance our enduring objectives of supporting human rights, improving the lives of the Cuban people, and promoting closer ties between our peoples. \n\n\n\n\n"
