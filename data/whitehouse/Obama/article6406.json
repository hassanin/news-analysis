These meetings provided an important opportunity for the Governments of Iraq and the United States to further our cooperation to strengthen and secure energy infrastructure, develop natural gas resources and reduce gas flaring, support improvements in electricity generation, and examine the roles efficiency and renewable energy can play in meeting Iraqi energy needs. The United States and Iraq remain committed to the development of Iraq’s electricity, oil, and gas sectors in an effort to build a strong economy that is capable of meeting the needs of the Iraqi people and bringing greater stability to world markets. We look forward to hosting the next Joint Coordination Committee on Energy meeting in Washington on a date to be agreed later.\n \nThe U.S.-Iraq Joint Coordination Committee on Energy statement issued today in Baghdad can be found HERE.\n\n\n\n\n"
