But today, cancer research is on the cusp of major breakthroughs. It is of critical national importance that we accelerate progress towards prevention, treatment, and a cure -- to double the rate of progress in the fight against cancer -- and put ourselves on a path to achieve in just 5 years research and treatment gains that otherwise might take a decade or more. To that end, I hereby direct the following:\n\n\tSection 1. White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force. There is established, within the Office of the Vice President, a White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force (Task Force), which will focus on making the most of Federal investments, targeted incentives, private sector efforts from industry and philanthropy, patient engagement initiatives, and other mechanisms to support cancer research and enable progress in treatment and care. The Vice President shall serve as Chair of the Task Force.\n\n\t(a) Membership of the Task Force. In addition to the Vice President, the Task Force shall consist of the heads of the executive branch departments, agencies, and offices listed below:\n\n\t(i) the Department of Defense;\n\n\t(ii) the Department of Commerce;\n\n\t(iii) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n\n\t(iv) the Department of Energy;\n\n\t(v) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n\n\t(vi) the Office of Management and Budget;\n\n\t(vii) the National Economic Council;\n\n\t(viii) the Domestic Policy Council;\n\n\t(ix) the Office of Science and Technology Policy;\n\n\t(x) the Food and Drug Administration;\n\n\t(xi) the National Cancer Institute (NCI);\n\n\t(xii) the National Institutes of Health (NIH);\n\n\t(xiii) the National Science Foundation; and\n\n\t(xiv) such other executive branch departments, agencies, or offices as the President may designate.\n\n\tA member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task Force functions of the member, any person who is a part of the member's department, agency, or office, and who is a full time officer or employee of the Federal Government. At the direction of the Chair, the Task Force may establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Task Force members or their designees under this section, as appropriate.\n\n\t(b) Administration of the Task Force.

The NCAB shall advise the Director of NCI on its recommendations respecting the future direction and program and policy emphasis of NCI as it relates to the work of the Task Force. To assist the NCAB in providing this advice, the NCAB is strongly encouraged to establish a working group consisting of a Blue Ribbon Panel of scientific experts. The Director shall relay the advice of the NCAB to the Task Force, as appropriate. The functions of the Task Force are advisory only and shall include, but shall not be limited to, producing a detailed set of findings and recommendations to:\n\n\t(a) accelerate our understanding of cancer, and its prevention, early detection, treatment, and cure;\n\n\t(b) improve patient access and care;\n\n\t(c) support greater access to new research, data, and computational capabilities;\n\n\t(d) encourage development of cancer treatments;\n\n\t(e) identify and address any unnecessary regulatory barriers and consider ways to expedite administrative reforms;\n\n\t(f) ensure optimal investment of Federal resources; and\n\n\t(g) identify opportunities to develop public-private partnerships and increase coordination of the Federal Government's efforts with the private sector, as appropriate.\n\n\tSec. 3. Outreach. Consistent with the objectives set out in section 2 of this memorandum, the Task Force, in accordance with applicable law, in addition to regular meetings, shall conduct outreach with representatives of the cancer patient community, academia, business, nonprofit organizations, State and local government agencies, the research community, and other interested persons that will assist with the Task Force's development of a detailed set of recommendations.\n\n\tSec. 4. Transparency and Reports. The Task Force shall facilitate the posting on the Internet of reports and engage in an open, reciprocal dialogue with the American people. The Task Force shall present to the President a report before December 31, 2016, on its findings and recommendations, which shall be made available to the public and posted on the Internet.\n\n\tSec. 5.
