On behalf of the American people, we offer our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families and loved ones of the more than 80 people who lost their lives.  We extend our wishes for a full recovery to those who were hurt.  We also offer our heartfelt gratitude to the Government of Spain and to the rescue personnel who are working to locate the missing and treat the injured – including at least six Americans. Today the American people grieve with our Spanish friends, who are in our thoughts and prayers.  We stand ready to provide any assistance we can in the difficult days ahead.\n\n\n\n\n"
