In past years, President Obama has encouraged students to study hard and take responsibility for their education, urging students to set goals, to believe in themselves, and to be the authors of their own destinies.\n\n\tBenjamin Banneker Academic High School opened in 1981 as a magnet school for students in grades 9-12 enrolled in rigorous academic experiences in preparation for college. It placed on the Newsweek list of America's Best High Schools for 2011 for their high graduation rates, college matriculation rates, and test scores. Banneker is a part of the District of Columbia Public Schools system.\n\n\tPresident Obama’s Back-to-School Speech will be live streamed on WhiteHouse.gov so that classrooms across the country may listen to or watch the remarks. For more information about watching the speech, visit obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/back-to-school.\n\n\tSchools across the country can also watch the speech live on MSNBC as a special feature of NBC News’ “Education Nation” – part of NBC’s weeklong commitment to education reports and programming across the network’s shows and platforms beginning September 25. \n\n\n\n\n"
