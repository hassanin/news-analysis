The bipartisan tax cuts package will boost economic growth and provide tangible relief for working families.  Without tax relief and unemployment assistance, the road to economic recovery would be very challenging.  This legislation gives families and businesses in Arlington the opportunity to improve their quality of life and invest back into the community.\n\n\n\n\n"
