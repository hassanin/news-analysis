Michael \"Scott\" Speicher have been recovered The news that Captain Speicher's remains have been recovered is a reminder of the selfless service that led him to make the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.  As with all our service men and women considered Missing in Action, we remain steadfast in our determination to bring our American heroes home.  I am grateful to the Marines who pursued the information that led to Captain Speicher's recovery so that he can now come home.  My thoughts and prayers are with his family, and I hope that the recovery of his remains will bring them a needed sense of closure.  ###   \n\n\n\n"
