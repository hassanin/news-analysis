And because of the steps the Administration and Congress have taken with Cash for Clunkers and the Recovery Act, the industry overall is strengthening.\nThe Hamtramck GM plant is one of nine that GM recently kept open during a scheduled summer shutdown in production.  The Jefferson North Chrysler plant just added a second shift bringing approximately 1,100 jobs to the plant.  The Chicago Ford plant has announced plans to add 1,200 new jobs thanks in part to Department of Energy loan guarantees to invest in clean energy upgrades.\n\n\n\n"
