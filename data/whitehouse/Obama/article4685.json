The meeting was also an opportunity to have a dialogue with the immigrant advocacy community on the Administration’s continued efforts to push Congress to fund the Department of Homeland Security and to pass comprehensive immigration reform.  The President also highlighted that despite the Texas district court’s ruling, the Administration will continue to make progress on many components of the executive actions and is confident we will ultimately be able to implement the deferred action policies. Many of the participants have been involved in outreach efforts to inform and educate the immigrant community on the executive actions.  The advocates in attendance agreed to continue their outreach to the community, work with the Administration on its efforts to fully implement the executive actions that were not blocked by the district court, and to push for commonsense immigration reform as the only lasting and permanent solution to fixing our broken immigration system.\nParticipants included: \n\n\n\t\tDeepak Bhargava, Center for Community Change\n\n\t\tGregory Cendana, Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance\n\n\t\tMarielena Hincapie, National Immigration Law Center\n\n\t\tMaria Teresa Kumar, Voto Latino\n\n\t\tEliseo Medina, Fast for Families\n\n\t\tBenjamin Monterroso, Mi Familia Vota\n\n\t\tJanet Murguía, NCLR\n\n\t\tAli Noorani, National Immigration Forum\n\n\t\tErin Oshiro, Immigration and Immigrant Rights Program for Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC)\n\n\t\tLorella Praeli, United We Dream\n\n\t\tArturo Rodriguez, United Farm Workers of America\n\n\t\tSimon Rosenberg, New Democrat Network\n\n\t\tRocio Sáenz, SEIU\n\n\t\tTodd Schulte, FWD.us\n\n\t\tHector Sanchez, Labor Council for Latin American Advancement and the Chair of National Hispanic Leadership Agenda\n\n\t\tFrank Sharry, America’s Voice\n\n\t\tNeera Tanden, Center for American Progress\n\n\n\n\n\n"
