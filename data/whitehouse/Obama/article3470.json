Rice on the Republic of Korea-Japan Agreement on “Comfort Women”\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe United States congratulates the Governments of Japan and the Republic of Korea on reaching an agreement, which they have made clear “finally and irreversibly” addresses the tragic treatment of \"comfort women\" during World War II.  We support this agreement and its full implementation, and believe this comprehensive resolution is an important gesture of healing and reconciliation that should be welcomed by the international community.\n\n\tThe United States applauds the leaders of the ROK and Japan, two of our most important allies, for having the courage and vision to forge a lasting settlement to this difficult issue. We look forward to deepening our work with both nations on a wide range of regional and global issues, on the basis of mutual interests and shared values, as well as to advancing trilateral security cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n"
