He extends his condolences to the families and condemns these attacks on consular and diplomatic personnel serving at our foreign missions.  In concert with Mexican authorities, we will work tirelessly to bring their killers to justice.\nThe President shares in the outrage of the Mexican people at the murders of thousands in Ciudad Juárez and elsewhere in Mexico.  We will continue to work with Mexican President Felipe Calderón and his government to break the power of the drug trafficking organizations that operate in Mexico and far too often target and kill the innocent.  This is a responsibility we must shoulder together, particularly in border communities where strong bonds of history, culture, and common interest bind the Mexican and the American people closely together.\n\n\n\n\n"
