Is this framework perfect? No, but President Obama made a tough decision that cuts taxes for workers and provides significant investment incentives for business. Make no mistake, we are still in for a long slog but this agreement puts money back into the hands of taxpayers and provides a measure of certainty for business that sets the stage for resurgent hiring and continued growth in 2011.\n\n\tMayor Bob Foster is the Western Chair of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors and the former President of Southern California Edison. The City of Long Beach, California, is home to the Port of Long Beach, part of the nationâ€™s largest port complex. For more information visit www.mayorbobfoster.com.\n\n\n\n\n"
