The bottom line is that there are more responsible ways to spend tens of billions of federal dollars, including investments that will help protect American consumers from high gas prices. The vote today - with support from over half the U.S. Senate - is an important step towards repealing these unwarranted subsidies for the oil and gas industry. The  Administration will continue to pursue this important reform.  \n\n\n\n\n"
