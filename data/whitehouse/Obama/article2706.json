In August 2014, I signed into law the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act (VACAA) of 2014, which charged the Commission to examine veterans' access to VA health care and to recommend how best to organize the VHA, locate health resources, and deliver health care to veterans during the next 20 years. \n\n\tThe Commission's report includes a number of specific proposals that I look forward to reviewing closely over the coming weeks. We will continue to work with veterans, Congress, and our partners in the veteran advocacy community to further our ongoing transformation of the veterans’ health care system. Our veterans deserve nothing less for their sacrifices and their service.\n\n\n\n\n"
