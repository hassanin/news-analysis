With this announcement, 81 companies will have signed the American Business Act on Climate Pledge to demonstrate their support for action on climate change and the conclusion of a climate change agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-carbon, sustainable future.  These 81 companies have operations in all 50 states, employ over 9 million people, represent more than $3 trillion in annual revenue, and have a combined market capitalization of over $5 trillion.\n\n\tBy signing the American Business Act on Climate pledge, these companies are:\n\n\n\t\tVoicing support for a strong Paris outcome. The pledge recognizes those countries that have already put forward climate targets, and voices support for a strong outcome in the Paris climate negotiations.\n\n\t\tDemonstrating an ongoing commitment to climate action. As part of this initiative, each company is announcing significant pledges to reduce their emissions, increase low-carbon investments, deploy more clean energy, and take other actions to build more sustainable businesses and tackle climate change.\n\n\t\tThese pledges include ambitious, company-specific goals such as:\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tReducing emissions by as much as 50 percent,\n\n\t\t\t\tReducing water usage by as much as 80 percent,\n\n\t\t\t\tAchieving zero waste-to-landfill,\n\n\t\t\t\tPurchasing 100 percent renewable energy, and\n\n\t\t\t\tPursuing zero net deforestation in supply chains.\n\n\n\n\t\tSetting an example for their peers. Today’s announcements builds on the launch of the American Business Act on Climate Pledge in July. This fall, the Obama Administration will release a third round of pledges, with a goal of mobilizing many more companies to join the American Business Act on Climate Pledge.\n\n\n\tThe impacts of climate change are already being felt worldwide. Nineteen of the 20 hottest years on record occurred in the past two decades. Countries and communities around the world are already being affected by deeper, more persistent droughts, pounded by more severe weather, inundated by bigger storm surges, and imperiled by more frequent and dangerous wildfires. Rising temperatures can lead to more smog, longer allergy seasons, and an increased incidence of extreme-weather-related injuries, all of which imperil public health, particularly for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, the sick, the poor, and some communities of color. No corner of the planet and no sector of the global economy will remain unaffected by climate change in the years ahead.\n\n\tClimate change is a global challenge that demands a global response, and President Obama is committed to leading the fight. The President’s Climate Action Plan, when fully implemented, will cut nearly 6 billion tons of carbon pollution through 2030, an amount equivalent to taking all the cars in the United States off the road for more than 4 years. The Clean Power Plan, the most significant domestic step any President has ever taken to combat climate change, will reduce emissions from the energy sector by 32% by 2030. And while the United States is leading on the international stage and the federal government is doing its part to combat climate change, hundreds of private companies, local governments, and foundations have stepped up to increase energy efficiency, boost low-carbon investing, and make solar energy more accessible to low-income Americans.\n\n\tThe measures taken by the public and private sectors enabled President Obama to set an ambitious but achievable goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by 26-28% by 2025 last November. And in the eleven months since, we’ve seen unprecedented global momentum in the fight against climate change.\n\n\tTo date, 150 countries representing more than 85% of global carbon emissions have reported post-2020 climate policies to the United Nations. This includes the major economies like the U.S., China, the European Union and India and it includes a large number of smaller economies, developing nations, island states and tropical countries – some of whom are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\n\n\tBut these submissions are only the beginning of achieving a successful outcome in Paris this December that puts in place a transparent global framework for increasing ambition over time and continuing to drive down emissions over the course of this century. As the world looks toward Paris, President Obama is committed to building on this momentum, with American leadership at all levels – the federal government, state and local governments and the private sector.\n\nClean Energy Investment \n\n\tAdditionally, leading up to the White House Clean Energy Investment Summit on June 16, 2015, an independent consortium of long-term investors (“LTIs”), including sovereign development funds, pension funds, endowments, family offices, and foundations, committed to building a new investment intermediary that will identify, screen, and assess high-potential companies and projects for commercial investment that could also produce impactful and profitable solutions to climate change.\n\n\tToday, this consortium will announce its founding CEO, interim board of directors, sponsors, and confirms the intention of the LTIs to deploy at least $1.2 billion of investment capital through an ‘aligned intermediary’, which they anticipate will be formally launched and branded in mid-2016.\n\n\tThe initial group of LTIs announcing financial commitments to work with the ‘aligned intermediary’ includes:\n\n\n\t\t$500 million from University of California’s Office of the Chief Investment Officer;\n\n\t\t350 million from the New Zealand Superannuation Fund;\n\n\t\t$200 million from the Alaska Permanent Fund;\n\n\t\t$100 million from TIAA-CREF; and\n\n\t\t$10 million from Tamarisc.\n\n\n\tThe effort launches with research support from the Hewlett Foundation, ClimateWorks Foundation, and Planet Heritage Foundation, and a commitment of further operational support, pending final approval, from the MacArthur Foundation.\n\n\tAs President Obama said at the U.N. Climate Summit last September, “There’s one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other, and that is the urgent and growing threat of a changing climate.” The American Business Act on Climate Pledge shows that the U.S. private sector, with its history of innovation and ingenuity, is committed to stepping up and doing its part in taking on this global challenge.\n\n\n*         *          *\n\nTHE AMERICAN BUSINESS ACT ON CLIMATE PLEDGE\n\nWe applaud the growing number of countries that have already set ambitious targets for climate action. In this context, we support the conclusion of a climate change agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-carbon, sustainable future.\n\nWe recognize that delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy will produce multiple benefits with regard to sustainable economic growth, public health, resilience to natural disasters, and the health of the global environment. \n\n\n\tThe following companies have joined the pledge and their detailed commitments can be viewed at:  obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/ClimatePledge\n\nABENGOA BIOENERGY US\n\n\tSince 2005 Abengoa Bioenergy has produced more than 2.5 billion gallons of renewable ethanol fuel in the US, displacing 2.5 billion gallons of petroleum based transportation fuel and reducing GHG emissions from those gallons by an average of 34%.  Building on this commitment to GHG reductions, Abengoa Bioenergy pledges to:\n\n\n\t\tRequire our contractors and suppliers to calculate and report their GHG emissions in order to accurately and affirmatively achieve further incremental emissions reductions in the supply chain.\n\n\t\tContinue to improve energy efficiencies and emissions controls in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 10%, compared to a 2005 baseline, by 2025.\n\n\t\tContinue the startup and full scale operation of our newly constructed commercial scale cellulosic ethanol facility in Hugoton, KS, producing up to 25 million gallons per year of extremely low carbon fuel, reducing GHG emissions by approximately 90% compared to petroleum fuels.\n\n\t\tComplete development of new technologies and promote joint investment with third parties in further cellulosic ethanol production facilities utilizing a broad range of feedstocks, including municipal waste, as well as agricultural residues.\n\n\t\tDevelop long-term business plans that align with the deep decarbonization necessary to keep global average temperatures from rising less than 2C.\n\n\nAEMETIS\n\n\tAemetis is planning to expand our technology platform and grow into new markets to combat climate change by significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by displacing petroleum based fuels.\n\n\tHaving met our 2006 pledge to deploy 100 MGY of low carbon biofuels by 2015, Aemetis further pledges to:\n\n\n\t\tDeploy over 400 MGY of ultra-low carbon fuel by 2025 with greater than 50% reduction of GHG, compared to gasoline.\n\n\t\tInvest approximately $800 million in new infrastructure for production of ultra-low carbon fuel by 2025.\n\n\t\tUtilize the lowest carbon intensity feedstocks, including agricultural residue and MSW, for the production of renewable jet, diesel, and gasoline replacing fuels.\n\n\nALCOA\n\n\tBuilding on our existing global commitment to reduce GHG intensity by 30% by 2020 (vs. 2005 baseline), Alcoa pledges to:\n\n\n\t\tReduce absolute GHG emissions by 50% in the U.S. (vs. 2005 baseline) by 2025,\n\n\t\tDeploy our full range of innovations to develop materials, products and technologies that move us toward a low carbon sustainable future, and by 2025, demonstrate a net reduction of GHG emissions from the use of our products equal to three times the emissions created by their production.\n\n\nAMERICAN EXPRESS\n\n\tAmerican Express has taken measurable actions to reduce its carbon footprint, optimize the efficiency and sustainability of its workplace, and support its customers in reducing their environmental footprints.
