With her years of experience enforcing the law – most recently as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas – Sarah is the right person to lead the dedicated men and women at ICE in securing our borders, keeping American communities safe, and upholding our values.  Since I took office, illegal border crossings are down and removal of dangerous criminals is up.  I’m confident Sarah will help us build on this progress while protecting our country in a smart, effective, and humane way.\n\n\n\n\n"
