Over the past 3 years, the company has purchased more than $900 million of U.S.-sourced content and services. Those investments spread across 45 states.\n\n\tGamesa opened its Offshore Wind Technology Center in Virginia in February 2011 in partnership  with Huntington Ingalls Industries, successor to Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding.  About 50  people now work at the facility  where they will  jointly design Gamesa’s first generation of offshore wind turbine, the  G11X-5.0 MW  machine, the first US designed offshore wind turbine. The team will install the first two  turbines --- one onshore and one offshore for comprehensive validation testing --- by the fourth quarter of 2012 in the  Mid-Atlantic region.\n\n\tIn 2009, the company upgraded its two U.S. manufacturing facilities to begin production of the new G90-2.0 MW wind turbine, which features a longer, lighter blade. The company has installed over 2,400 megawatts at 24 wind farms in 11 states, and has another 900 megawatts  currently under construction in United States, all of which are expected to go operational by the end of 2011.\n\n\n\n\n"
