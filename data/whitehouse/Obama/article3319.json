The President assured President Park that the United States stands in solidarity with the ROK and will take the necessary steps to fulfill our ironclad commitment to defend the ROK and our other allies in the region.  The two leaders underscored the importance of a strong and united international response to North Korea's provocations, including through a robust UN Security Council Resolution.\n\n\n\n\n"
