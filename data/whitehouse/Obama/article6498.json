The President discussed the importance of his administration serving as an active partner with states to move the ball forward on a number of issues, including strengthening our economy, increasing economic mobility and tackling the challenge of the long-term unemployed. The President has said that he will use his executive authority- both his pen and his phone- to act on behalf of the American people, and he pledged to work closely with governors of both parties on our agenda for 2014. 2014 is a year of action, and the President and the governors discussed steps we can take to create jobs, expand economic opportunity for the middle class and those striving to get there, and ensure children in all states have the education and skills they need to compete successfully in a global economy.  Specifically, the President committed to working with governors on strategic investments in transportation and infrastructure to grow the economy, and to build on the important work that is underway in many states on expanding access to early education. \nThe following governors were in attendance:\n\n\n\t\tOklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin\n\n\t\tColorado Gov. John Hickenlooper\n\n\t\tArkansas Gov. Mike Beebe\n\n\t\tMinnesota Gov. Mark Dayton\n\n\t\tUtah Gov. Gary Herbert\n\n\t\tWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\n\n\n\n\n\n"
