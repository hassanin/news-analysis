Peter Shumlin today issued the following statement on President Obama’s American Jobs Act:\n\n\t“I commend President Obama for his bold proposal to get Americans back to work and put the country on the road to recovery. This is the number one issue on the minds of all Americans, and I am pleased that the President’s plan will translate directly into more jobs for Vermonters. The American Jobs Act will give Vermont families and small businesses the economic relief they desperately need while putting more Vermonters back to work, including teachers, veterans, construction workers and first responders.\n\t \n\t“Vermonters need bold and decisive action from their leaders now more than ever, and I urge Congress to put aside partisan bickering and come together for the good of the nation to pass this jobs bill and get Americans back to work.” \n\n\n\n\n"
