The President will also discuss how Americans can work together to foster a constructive national conversation on this important issue as we work to build a bipartisan consensus in Congress.\n\t \n\tPrior to the speech, President Obama will tour the cargo facility at the Bridge of the Americas Port of Entry, the largest of four crossings that comprise the El Paso Port of Entry.  The Bridge of the Americas processes inbound and outbound commercial, private vehicle, bus, and pedestrian traffic.  Of the half a billion inspections conducted annually at 327 ports of entry across the nation, approximately ten percent will enter through the El Paso Port of Entry.  This event is pooled press.\n\t \nPresident Obama Tours Cargo Facility at Bridge of the Americas Port of Entry\n\t1 PM MDT\n\tBridge of the Americas Port of Entry\n\tEl Paso, Texas\n\tThis event is pooled press\n\t \nPresident Obama Delivers Remarks\n\t1:30 PM MDT\n\tChamizal National Memorial\n\t800 South San Marcial Street\n\tEl Paso, Texas\n\tThis event is open to pre-credentialed media\n\t \nBackground\n\tIn recent weeks the President has met with and heard from leaders and stakeholders from diverse sectors including faith, business, law enforcement officials, current and former elected officials and others about the need to fix the broken immigration system, and why it matters to the American economy and will allow us to better use our national security and law enforcement resources. The President wants to have a civil and constructive debate on this issue.\n\n\tThe United States has been enriched by a steady stream of hardworking and talented people who have helped make America an engine of the global economy and a beacon of hope around the world.  As we work to rebuild the economy, our ability to thrive depends, in part, on restoring responsibility and accountability to the immigration system.  President Obama believes Democrats and Republicans should come together to tackle an issue that is critical not only to our national security but also to the economy and our global competiveness.  In his recent meetings, the President has made clear he will continue to lead on this issue, but has asked these leaders to take a public and active role in elevating the immigration debate. To date, thirty community conversations are being organized around the country, among them:\n\t \n\n\n\t\tMay 11:  Business, labor, law enforcement, and faith leaders join Senior Administration officials for a conference call to recap the President’s speech and next steps.\n\n\t\tMay 12: Business leaders join U.S. Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra and Administration officials in Omaha, Nebraska for a roundtable community conversation.\n\n\t\tMay 12: Steve Case, Founder and former CEO of AOL and chair of the Startup America Partnership joins Senior Administration officials in a community conversation in Silicon Valley.\n\n\t\tMay 19: Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) leaders join Secretary Solis on a national conference call.\n\n\t\tMay 31: The Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce hosts a roundtable with Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
