This E.O. is part of our response to North Korea’s January 6 nuclear test and February 7 launch using ballistic missile technology, and it enables U.S. implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2270 and the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016. \n\n\tThese actions are consistent with our longstanding commitment to apply sustained pressure on the North Korean regime.  The U.S. and the global community will not tolerate North Korea’s illicit nuclear and ballistic missile activities, and we will continue to impose costs on North Korea until it comes into compliance with its international obligations. \n\n\n\n\n"
