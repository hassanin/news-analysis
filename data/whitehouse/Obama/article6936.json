The First Lady will welcome 130 middle and high school students from around the Washington, D.C. area to take part in an educational workshop, Celebrando el Ritmo Latino: The History of Latin Music. Beginning at 11:00 a.m. in the State Dining Room, The GRAMMY Museum’s Executive Director Robert Santelli will lead the students in an overview of the origins of Latin music, inform them of the elements of the genre, discuss how Latin music has been popularized in other parts of the world and talk about the many subgenres that encompass the larger Latin genre.
