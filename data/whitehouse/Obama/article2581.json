They will consult on key international climate change issues, including the implementation of the Paris Agreement and our mutual efforts to secure an amendment to the Montreal Protocol and to adopt a market based measure to reduce emissions from international aviation. Over the past three years, the United States and China have adopted strong domestic measures, and partnered to galvanize global action, to combat climate change. These meetings are further evidence of the continuing bilateral engagement on this issue.  \n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
