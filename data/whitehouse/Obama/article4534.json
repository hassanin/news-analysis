It lays out a strategy to strengthen our middle class with investments in research, education, training, and infrastructure, while also fulfilling our most basic responsibility to keep Americans safe.\nIn 2013 Republicans came to the negotiating table and ultimately chose the responsible path by supporting the Murray-Ryan agreement, which reversed harmful sequestration cuts to both defense and non-defense equally, dollar for dollar.  Last night, Senators from both parties came together to call for building on that approach this year and to support paying for sequester relief with both spending and tax reforms.  The President has been clear that he will not accept a budget that locks in sequestration or one that increases funding for our national security without providing matching increases in funding for our economic security.  The Administration will continue to abide by these principles moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n"
