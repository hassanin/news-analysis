This significant route, named the “3C Corridor,” has a length of 250 miles and will serve communities near Lake Erie, in Central Ohio, and the Tri-State region around Cincinnati. These metropolitan areas are among the largest in the United States that are currently not served by passenger rail.\n\nThe corridor will connect 12 economically-distressed counties, and the new service will create thousands of direct and indirect jobs throughout the state. The project will also bring livability bene\u001dfits to the region, as many new stations will be constructed or restored in historic downtowns where they will connect to transit and other modes of transportation. Nearly 40 colleges and universities lie in close proximity to the route, as do the headquarters of 22 Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThe 3C Corridor is expected to be the fi\u001drst phase of a long-term vision for an extensive network of passenger rail corridors connecting the cities of Ohio and neighboring states. Subsequent phases are expected to increase speeds, cut trip times and boost available round trips.\nSummary of Corridor Investments\nUsing funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), this new service is expected to o\u001fffer three daily round trips at speeds up to 79 mph, serving a population of more than 6.8 million people (nearly 60 percent of Ohio’s population).\n\nThis investment will fund a number of projects across the state, including track upgrades, grade crossings, new stations, and maintenance facilities. This project will also include planning for necessary equipment that can support future service improvements.\n \n\n\n\n"
