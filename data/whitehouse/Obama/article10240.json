Central, chronically one of Miami’s lowest achieving schools, has been engaged in rigorous turnaround work and has seen some early successes. Last year, the Department of Education awarded states $3.5 billion in School Improvement Grant (SIG) funding and Florida received $170.2 million. The State, in turn, awarded Miami-Dade School District nearly $14 million to turn around its 19 persistently lowest achieving schools.  This year, the Obama Administration will award an additional $545,000,000  in SIG funds.\n\t \n\tIn order to receive SIG funds schools must implement one of the following four models:\n\t \n\n\nTurnaround Model: Replace the principal, screen existing school staff, and rehire no more than half the teachers; adopt a new governance structure; and improve the school through curriculum reform, professional development, extending learning time, and other strategies.\n\nRestart Model: Convert a school or close it and re-open it as a charter school or under an education management organization.\n\nSchool Closure: Close the school and send the students to higher-achieving schools in the district.\n\nTransformation Model: Replace the principal and improve the school through comprehensive curriculum reform, professional development, extending learning time, and engaging the community and families\n\n\n\t \nMIAMI CENTRAL SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL\n\t \n\tMiami Central Senior High School was awarded $784,700 in SIG funds and is implementing the turnaround model.  As part of the implementation of this model Central has:\n\t \n\n\n\t\tPromoted a strong school leader to become the new principal\n\n\t\tReplaced more than half the staff\n\n\t\tExtended learning time by adding after school instruction in reading and math\n\n\t\tReceived additional instructional support from the district’s turnaround office to improve the quality of teaching and learning  \n\n\t\tExpanded the Parent Academy which offers classes for parents on graduation requirements, financial literacy, and how to access student grades, attendance, and information on standardized tests\n\n\t\tEmbraced common planning where teachers come together to create lesson plans and observe one another teach\n\n\t\tIncreased use of technology such as SMARTBOARDS and response clickers for instantaneous assessment of student learning\n\n\t\tImplementation of Response to Intervention (RTI) to help teachers use data to identify student needs\n\n\t\tIncorporated interventionists in the classroom to provide small group and individualized instruction to struggling students\n\n\t\tUtilized a positive behavior support system which includes explicit instruction about civility and behavior, common agreement about acceptable behavior, and rewards for good behavior.\n\n\t\tOffered a Saturday Academy for first-year teachers on teaching the standards, data analysis, and lesson planning\n\n\n\t \n\tMiami Central Senior High School was engaged in implementing reforms before receiving federal SIG funds and successfully improved its  scores from an “F” to a “D” on the State’s report card two years ago and then from a “D” to a “C” last year.  Achievement at the school has improved by 40 points in writing and over 60 points in math, and the school has improved its graduation rate over the past 5 years from 36 to 63 percent.  Some of the interventions used include:\n\t \n\n\n\t\tHired two Community Involvement Specialists who conduct home visits for truant and disruptive students.\n\n\t\tCreated a Saturday Academy to provide support for students in reading, mathematics, and science.\n\n\t\tUsed data to drive instruction\n\n\n\t \n\tMiami Central Senior High School is also a powerful empowerment story where students are learning the skills to be entrepreneurs and create their own businesses:\n\t \n\n\n\t\tMiami Central is one of the largest implementations of the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), with over 200 students enrolled\n\n\t\tStudents are in 12 class periods ranging from Information Technology to Health Life Management Skills\n\n\t\tCommunity volunteers and business leaders mentor the students, including an “E-Club” where students write business plans and get local-available seed capital to get their business going\n\n\t\tWith students having launched real business (e.g, SD’s Frozen Yogurt Treats, Msz Loka’s Mini Flea), the program has boosted attendance and builds empowerment.\n\n\n\t \n\tA fact sheet on School Improvement Grants is available HERE. \n\n\n\n\n"
