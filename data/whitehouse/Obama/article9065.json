These provocative aerial bombardments greatly increase the potential for direct confrontation between Sudan and South Sudan.\nThe United States demands the Government of Sudan halt aerial bombardments immediately.  We urge the Government of South Sudan to exercise restraint in responding to this provocation to prevent further escalation of hostilities.\nThe United States calls on the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North to immediately resume negotiations on a cessation of hostilities and resume political talks toward political and security arrangements for Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile.\n\n\n\n\n"
