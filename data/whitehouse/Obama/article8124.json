The two leaders shared their growing concerns about the Syrian regime’s ruthless attacks against its own people, most recently in Aleppo, and the deteriorating humanitarian conditions throughout Syria as a result of the regime’s atrocities.  The two pledged to coordinate efforts to assist the growing numbers of displaced Syrians, not only within Syria, but in Turkey and the broader region.  The President acknowledged the generosity of the Turkish people in hosting so many Syrians who have fled their homes in search of safety in Turkey.  They agreed that U.S. and Turkish teams would remain in close contact on ways that Turkey and the United States can work together to promote a democratic transition in Syria.  The Prime Minister also conveyed his personal condolences for the tragedy in Colorado.\n\n\n\n\n"
