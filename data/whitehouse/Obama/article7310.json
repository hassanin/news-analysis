The son of working class immigrants, Frank served honorably in World War II, went to college on the G.I. bill and came back to build one of the most successful companies in America. He’s the reason why people can’t smoke on airplanes, why domestic abusers can’t possess guns. He worked tirelessly against drunk driving, and co-wrote the new G.I. Bill because he knew first-hand what it could do. I consider it a privilege to have known him, to have worked with him, and to have called him my friend. Jill and I will truly miss Frank. Our hearts go out to his children and his wife Bonnie.\nIn the latest installment of Vice President Biden's audio series \"Being Biden,\" the Vice President remembers Sen. Lautenberg. Listen to the audio HERE.\n\n\n\n\n"
