This law has been overwhelmingly successful since it was first enacted 17 years ago to improve the criminal justice response to this violent crime and to assist those who experience this abuse.  Since then, the law has twice been reauthorized with the broad support of members of both parties.  It should still be bigger than politics today.  \n\n\tWe’ve made a lot of progress, but the Violence Against Women Act is as important today as it’s ever been.  The Senate’s action today reaffirms that addressing this problem is bigger than politics.   Now the House needs to act so the President can sign this vital legislation as soon as possible. \n\n\t###\n\n\n\n\n"
