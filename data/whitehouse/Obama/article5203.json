The leaders also agreed that the coalition will continue to coordinate in order to counter sources of ISIL funding. \nOn Ukraine, the leaders discussed the need for Russia to fulfill all of its obligations under the Minsk agreements.  Additionally, they discussed efforts to work alongside international financial institutions to support Ukraine’s economy.  \nThe President looks forward to continuing his conversations with his counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n"
