But too many Americans are not aware that they qualify for the credit, so I urge people to visit www.irs.gov, where you can also learn more about other tax breaks available for working Americans this year.  \n###\nOn average, one in four eligible taxpayers fails to claim EITC.  Today, we’ll continue to spread the word about the credit and if you are eligible.  Nationally, community organizations sponsor 12,000 free tax help sites, staffed by IRS-trained volunteers. The IRS itself will have Saturday service tomorrow (Jan. 30) as well as two Saturdays in February at selected sites to help EITC taxpayers.  To learn more about these resources, please visit www.irs.gov.  In addition, IRS hosts Free File, a free software service that lets you prepare and e-file your federal tax return. See www.irs.gov/freefile for details.\n\n\n\n"
