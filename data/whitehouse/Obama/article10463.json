His team has helped lead the effort to provide comprehensive and independent oversight of fiscal initiatives in Afghanistan. Under General Fields’ tenure, SIGAR produced numerous critical reports that have improved reconstruction efforts, and helped insure that U.S.-funded programs are achieving their objectives.\n\tGeneral Fields’ hard work and steadfast determination have established SIGAR as a critical oversight agency. By accepting the offer to become the SIGAR in 2008, He continued a long and distinguished career of public service. For more than 40 years, General Fields has been committed to securing our national defense. As he moves on to new challenges, he can do so confident in the knowledge that the President and the American people owe him a debt of gratitude for his courage, leadership, and selfless service to our nation.\n\tSIGAR has a fundamental role in protecting the vital interests of the United States. Going forward, we will continue to work through SIGAR and with Congress to ensure that U.S. programs in Afghanistan effectively and efficiently achieve their objectives.\n\n\n\n\n"
