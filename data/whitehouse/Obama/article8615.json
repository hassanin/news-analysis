We urge the House to adopt these important changes.\n\n\tWhile this vote marks a moment of bipartisan cooperation, there is much more work to be done to create an economy that is built to last, and we encourage Congress to act on additional measures like rebuilding our nation’s crumbling roads and bridges, putting our teachers back in the classroom and first responders back on the beat, and reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank which thousands of American businesses and their workers depend on to stay competitive in the global economy. \n\n\n\n\n"
