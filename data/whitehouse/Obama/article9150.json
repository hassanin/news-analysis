Secretary Salazar and his staff will work with industry and civil society to develop a sensible plan to disclose relevant information about revenues from oil, gas, and mining assets, and to enhance the accountability and transparency of our revenue collection efforts.  Under Secretary Salazar’s leadership, the Department of Interior has a strong record of partnering with industry and citizens to make important strides in reforming the management of our natural resources, and EITI is just the latest in a long series of steps designed to make the U.S. government more open and more accountable to the American people.\n\n\n\n\n"
