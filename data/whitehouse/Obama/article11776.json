This result was achieved because those who oversee the insurance industry on the state and federal levels heard these voices, held investigations, and demanded action.\nThe Affordable Care Act will ensure that people across this country have access to the affordable, quality care they deserve.  As we implement this law, our Department, and especially our new Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, will closely monitor the industry, and we will not hesitate to act to prevent exorbitant premium hikes.\"\n\n\n\n"
