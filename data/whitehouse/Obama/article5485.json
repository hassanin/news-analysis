In that order, he declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.).  Because the Export Administration Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the national emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must continue in effect beyond August 17, 2014.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222. \nThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\nBARACK OBAMA\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tAugust 7, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n"
