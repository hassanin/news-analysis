The Administration also unveiled a new resource guide for schools, colleges and universities, employers, and community leaders to help them create their own capability initiatives aimed at empowering Americans to better understand and address financial matters, from saving for retirement to managing credit.\n\n\t“Across our country, millions of Americans work hard and play by the rules to protect the gains they have made and secure a brighter future for their loved ones” said Cecilia Muñoz, Director of the Domestic Policy Council. “The resilience and ingenuity of our people are driving our economic recovery, and as we lay the foundation for an America built to last, we must also promote the ability of all Americans to make financial decisions that help them gain a footing into the middle class, kinder their entrepreneurial spirit, and sustain our long-term economic stability.”\n\n\t“After what we’ve learned from the Great Recession, now more than ever we know the importance of empowering more Americans with both financial literacy and clear, basic financial information to not only protect them from devastating personal outcomes but also to prevent dynamics that can harm the entire economy,” said Gene Sperling, Director of the National Economic Council.  \n\n\tIn addition to the resource guide, a new, interactive tool for youth and parents to learn important financial lessons from ages 3 to 18+ was officially launched. Money as You Grow, created by the President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability, uses easy-to-understand language and includes behavior-changing activities around 20 key money concepts.\n\n\tStudies show young Americans, low-income households, Latinos and African-Americans present particular vulnerabilities in financial capability. Approximately one in three Latinos and African-Americans do not have a bank account and nearly a quarter approach retirement with less than $1,000 in total net worth, excluding pensions and Social Security.  Young adults, ages 18-29,  are more likely to pay the minimum payment only on their credit cards, rapidly accruing debt.\n\n\tThe 14 new commitments, aimed at helping thousands of Americans access information and tools they need to make responsible financial decisions, were made by companies and organizations across the public, private and non-profit sectors, including:\n\n\nREACHING CITIES & COMMUNITIES\n\n\t• National Conference of Black Mayors: The National Conference of Black Mayors (NCBM) announced that more than 80 Mayors have committed to stand up local Financial Literacy Councils before the end of 2012 with goal of 100 cities.  These Financial Literacy Councils will serve as a local one-stop shop for financial dignity, financial capability and empowerment, for youth, consumers, and businesses.  For the full list of cities, please click here.\n\n\t• Allstate: Allstate committed to providing $1 million to support state domestic violence coalitions in their work to provide innovative financial services to survivors of domestic violence in order to help empower them to make financial decisions on their own.\n\n\t• Charles Schwab Foundation: The Charles Schwab Foundation committed $1 million over two years to co-develop with AARP Foundation a financial education and mentoring pilot program designed to help vulnerable older workers and job-seekers set goals and implement action plans to reduce debt, repair credit, build savings and regain control of their finances. The program will be delivered through select nonprofit partners in six cities – Washington, D.C. metro area, Austin, Denver, Phoenix, New Orleans and San Francisco.  Launching this summer, the pilot program has a goal to mobilize 300 volunteers and reach 6,000 participants in the first year.\n\n\t• HelloWallet and Marsh & McLennan Companies: In cooperation with Marsh & McLennan Companies, HelloWallet, a technology start-up that provides unbiased financial guidance to workers at leading U.S. employers, has committed to donating 20,000 two-year subscriptions to non-profit and government organizations to help a variety of Americans in need improve their well-being and manage their financial responsibilities. The value of these memberships is worth more than $4 million, which HelloWallet expects to generate at least an estimated $20 million in new savings for individuals and families in need.\n\n\t• MasterCard: MasterCard is making two new community-based announcements: 1) the creation of ‘Your Money Smarter’, which is a new regional financial inclusion and education program that delivers basic and useful tips about budgeting, tracking, saving and spending money and understanding financial management tools to communities in the US via text message and is a scalable platform that will be tested with 18 community organizations in the U.S. and then eventually rolled out nationally; and 2) the ‘PayPerks for Public Sector’ program, which is an optional feature of MasterCard’s federal, state and local government prepaid card programs that fuses online education with sweepstakes-based incentives in order to provide consumers with information on the most effective use of their government-sponsored prepaid cards.\n\n\nREACHING AMERICA’S YOUTH\n\n\t• Chicago Public Schools and Discover: The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) is announcing a K - 12 Financial Literacy Framework that will launch during the upcoming 2012-2013 school year with a 12th Grade Personal Finance Capstone Course.
