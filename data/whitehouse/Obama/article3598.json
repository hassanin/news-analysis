or\n\n\t\tattacks, attempted attacks, or threats against United Nations missions, international security presences, or other peacekeeping operations.\n\n\n\tThe E.O. also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to target any person determined to be a leader or official of: \n\n\n\t\tan entity, including any government entity or armed group, that has, or whose members have, engaged in any of the activities described above; or\n\n\t\tan entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the E.O.\n\n\n\tThe E.O. also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to target any person determined to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of:\n\n\n\t\tany of the activities described above; or\n\n\t\tany person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the E.O.\n\n\n\tFinally, the E.O. authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to target any person owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to the E.O.\n\n\tIndividuals identified or designated for the imposition of sanctions under the E.O., including the four individuals that have been listed today in the Annex of the E.O., will have their property and interests in property in the United States blocked or frozen, and U.S. persons are prohibited from doing business with them.  The E.O. also imposes visa restrictions on individuals identified or designated under the E.O.\n\n\tThe President imposed sanctions on the following four individuals listed in the Annex to the E.O.:\n\n\n\nAlain Guillaume Bunyoni: [Minister of Public Security]\n\n\t\t\tAlain Guillaume Bunyoni is the Minister of Public Security in Burundi and has overseen the Government’s internal security efforts, including those of Burundi’s National Police (PNB), an entity whose members have engaged in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Burundi.  Under Bunyoni, the PNB has conducted operations in cooperation with the Imbonerakure youth militia to intimidate and silence those who oppose or who are perceived to oppose the Government of Burundi.\n\n\n\nGodefroid Bizimana: [Deputy Director-General of the National Police]\n\n\t\t\tGodefroid Bizimana is a leader of the PNB, an entity whose members have engaged in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security or stability of Burundi, human rights abuses, and actions or policies that prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or freedom of peaceful assembly.  Bizimana directed the PNB’s operations to disrupt peaceful protests of those opposed to the Government of Burundi, including a disproportionate use of force and acts of violent repression.  In response to protests, PNB officers used tear gas, water cannons, and blocked the free movement of demonstrators.  Protestors were arrested and twenty of them were reportedly transported to a location where they were beaten by police officers. \n\n\n\nGodefroid Niyombare: [Major General, Former Chief of Burundi Intelligence Service (SNR)]\n\n\t\t\tGodefroid Niyombare is responsible for or complicit in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Burundi, and is a leader or official of an entity that has engaged in such activities.  As the leader of an attempt to overthrow the Government of Burundi in May 2015, Niyombare’s actions contributed to the deterioration of stability within Burundi.  After announcing the coup, Niyombare ordered the closure of Burundi’s land borders and its primary airport in an attempt to stop Nkurunziza from returning from Tanzania.\n\n\n\nCyrille Ndayirukiye: [Former Minister of Defense] \n\n\t\t\tCyrille Ndayirukiye is responsible for or complicit in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Burundi, and is a leader or official of an entity that has engaged in such activities.  As deputy leader of an attempt to overthrow the Government of Burundi in May 2015, Ndayirukiye’s actions contributed to the deterioration of stability within Burundi.  Ndayiruke was detained in June by the Government of Burundi, which should grant full and regular humanitarian access by independent monitors to confirm Ndayiruke and other detainees are not being subjected to torture or ill-treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
