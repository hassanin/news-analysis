Iranian authorities are perpetrating a wide variety of abuses against a broad spectrum of Iranians, irrespective of age, gender, faith, or profession. The Special Rapporteur created by the Council provides the international community with a mandate to monitor and call attention to such abuses.  The Iranian Government has a responsibility to protect its citizens and allow its people’s voices to be heard.  The United States will continue to speak out on behalf of all those brave Iranians struggling for their universal rights.\n\n\n\n\n"
