In some cases, the awards that the Inspectors General oversee will continue to outlay past December 31, 2012. The $11.5 million unobligated balance will allow Inspectors General the needed flexibility to effectively combat waste, fraud, and abuse.\nTherefore, in accordance with section 1306 of the Dodd-Frank Act, I am waiving the requirements for repayment of unobligated funds made available in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act with respect to the accounts described above.\nThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register.\nBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
