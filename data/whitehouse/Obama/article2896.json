During this season, we reflect on Buddha's universal teachings of peace, service, and recognition of common humanity -- shared values that also bind us all as Americans. This occasion gives us an opportunity to commemorate the many contributions of Buddhists to our progress and to recommit ourselves to building a brighter future for all communities, cultures, and religions. As we come together in hope for wisdom, courage, and compassion, our family sends our best wishes during this season.\n\n\n\n\n"
