Jill and I had genuine affection for Ted.  As Senators, he and I bonded over shared similar family tragedies, but we also celebrated life's great moments together too, like the births of our daughters a few days apart.   We served together for more than 30 years, but more than that, he was my friend and I will miss him.\"\n\n\n\n"
