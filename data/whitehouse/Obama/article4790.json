The two leaders discussed the continued attacks in eastern Ukraine by Russian-backed separatists and the heavy toll that the Russian-backed offensive in the east was having on Ukraine's civilian population. The Vice President noted that as long as Russia continues its blatant disregard of its obligations under the Minsk agreements, the costs for Russia will continue to rise.\n\n\n\n\n"
