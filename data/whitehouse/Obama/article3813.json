The Republicans and Democrats who came together to pass the INA were driven by a desire to expand opportunity for all, and to live up to our heritage as a nation of immigrants.  They understood that immigration contributes to our economic growth by allowing hard-working, entrepreneurial individuals from around the world to pursue the American dream.  \n\n\tAs we mark the 50th anniversary of this transformational law, we honor the courage of those who fought to make our system better.  We celebrate the generations of immigrants who have shaped this country and helped make America great.  And we recommit ourselves to fighting for commonsense, comprehensive immigration reform legislation that meets the needs of the 21st century, grows the economy for everybody, and lives up to our highest ideals.\n\n\n\n\n"
