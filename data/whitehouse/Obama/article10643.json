Mark Schauer (D-MI) issued the following statement in support of a bipartisan plan to extend unemployment benefits and tax cuts for Michigan families.\n\t \n“With our economy still struggling, now is not the time to raise taxes or pull the rug out from workers who’ve lost a job through no fault of their own. Extending unemployment benefits and tax cuts for all wage earners will provide working families and small businesses with certainty, and ultimately help put people back to work. While I have concerns about proposed changes to the estate tax in this plan that I would like to see addressed, this proposal is an important step towards a bipartisan compromise that will help get our economy back on track.”\n\n\n\n\n"
