Today, we have the opportunity to open even more new markets to goods and services backed by three proud words: Made in America.  I look forward to working with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to pass this bill, seize this opportunity, and support more good American jobs with the wages and benefits hardworking families deserve.\nI also welcome the introduction of Trade Adjustment Assistance legislation that will strengthen the current program to protect American workers. \n\n\n\n\n"
