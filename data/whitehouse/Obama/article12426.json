Mr. Turner was the First Lady’s guest at the President’s address to the joint session of Congress in September of 2009. The President told Mr. Turner that stories like his motivate him every day to keep working on health insurance reform, and he assured Mr. Turner that he will continue to work to pass health legislation to ban rescission and other abusive practices.\n-- Senator Harry Reid\n-- Senator Chris Dodd\n-- Senator Dick Durbin\n-- Senator Jay Rockefeller\n-- Senator Max Baucus\n-- Senator Robert Byrd\n-- Senator Sherrod Brown\n-- Senator Charles Schumer\n-- Senator Tom Harkin\n-- Senator Debbie Stabenow\n-- Senator Patty Murray\n-- Senator Roland Burris\n\n\n\n"
