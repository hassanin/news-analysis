This strong, bipartisan bill intensifies pressure against the Hizballah terrorist organization and provides the Administration additional tools with which to target Hizballah’s financial lifeblood. We continue to  work with Congress in a bipartisan way to ensure that we maximize the tools available to us to thwart Hizballah’s network at every turn, and we look forward to working together as we implement these new authorities. The U.S. Government has made significant progress and will continue to further disrupt Hizballah’s terrorist capabilities by targeting the group’s financial support infrastructure. We are committed to continuing to take strong action, such as imposing sanctions, to counter the activities of Hizballah operatives and supporters, wherever they are located.\n\n\n\n\n"
