Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of those killed, and we wish a speedy recovery to those injured. We remain steadfast in our support for Turkey, our NATO Ally and partner, which continues to be afflicted by terrorist attacks that indiscriminately kill and wound both security personnel and civilians. We are in close touch with Turkish authorities and will continue to work together with Turkey to confront the threats we face from terrorist groups. Vice President Biden will travel to Ankara next week to reaffirm our commitment to Turkeyâ€™s security and democracy.\n\n\n\n\n"
