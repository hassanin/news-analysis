The group discussed their shared goals for 2014, and the President expressed his desire to continue to work together to advance a number of our priorities for the year to strengthen our economy, create jobs and build the middle class. The President has declared 2014 a year of action, and while he will continue to use his executive authority - his pen and phone - to get things done, he will also work with Congress to make progress on behalf of the American people. The President addressed a number of issues with the Caucus, including increasing the minimum wage so those Americans working hard can have a living wage, passing commonsense immigration reform, strengthening education and promoting a number of other jobs and growth measures.\n\n\n\n\n"
