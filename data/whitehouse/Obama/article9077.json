Security Council, where Portugal currently serves as Council President, on issues of mutual concern, such as Syria, Libya, Middle East peace, and Iran.  We emphasized the importance that both our countries attach to the role of the United Nations in the promotion of peace, democracy, good governance and human rights. \nAs two of the original founding members of NATO, we reaffirmed our commitment to the Atlantic Alliance.  We discussed ongoing NATO operations, in particular in Afghanistan, where Portugal intends to maintain its contribution.  Recalling the success of the 2010 NATO Summit in Lisbon, we reviewed plans for the May 2012 NATO Summit that President Obama will host in Chicago.  We agreed that we would work together in the coming months to ensure that the Summit advances our joint goal of ensuring that the Alliance is fully prepared to meet the security challenges of the 21st century.\n\n\n\n\n"
