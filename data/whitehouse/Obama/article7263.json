And because the Administration acted, today thousands of ambitious, hardworking young people have been able to emerge from the shadows, no longer living in fear of deportation. But the steps we took were never meant to be a permanent solution. That's why we need Congress to pass a bipartisan, commonsense immigration reform bill as soon as possible so that these \"Dreamers\" can keep contributing to this country and help us live up to our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\n###\n \n\n\n\n\n"
