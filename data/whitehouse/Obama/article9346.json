They want to get back to work.  And they want Washington to get to work on a real plan to get our economy moving again.  \n\n\tThis debate about jobs is not about politics;  it’s about people – their lives, their hopes, their dreams for a better, more secure life for themselves and their families.\n\n\tDemocrats are working to get results for those families and we hope some of our Republican colleagues will join us because it’s time to do our jobs so the American people can get back to work.”\n\n\n\n\n"
