Instead of releasing Mr. Gross so he can come home to his wife and family, today's decision by Cuban authorities compounds the injustice suffered by a man helping to increase the free flow of information, to, from, and among the Cuban people.\n\n\tWe remain deeply concerned for Mr. Gross' well being and that of his family and reiterate our call for his immediate release.\n\n\n\n\n"
