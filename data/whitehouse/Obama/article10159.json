Nearly a year after being awarded $100 million in Race to the Top funding, Delaware’s grant has significantly helped the state make progress toward improving its education system. In remarks at Howard High School of Technology, the Vice President and Secretary Duncan will discuss the success of teacher collaboration in Delaware, as well as how winning the future in education will continue to require investments that promote a shared responsibility among everyone involved; reform at the state and local levels; and a focus on achieving results. They will be joined in Wilmington by Governor Jack Markell, Senator Chris Coons, Representative John Carney and President of the Delaware State Education Association Diane Donohue\n\t \nBackground On Teacher Collaboration:\n\t \n\tThe Administration has consistently sought to lift up the work labor and management can do to support student success when they work collaboratively. In February, the Department, along with key partners like the National Education Association (NEA) and American Federation of Teachers (AFT) sponsored a two day conference attended by 150 school districts – including the School Board President, teachers union president and Superintendent from each district -- to identify labor-management relationships, policies and agreements that can drive student achievement.\n\t \n\tFrom the work of Maryland’s Montgomery County Public Schools with its local NEA affiliate to reduce the achievement gap in the district, to Los Angeles’ ABC Unified School District in Los Angeles, where an over decade-long partnership with the AFT local has lead to annual increases in the district’s score on California’s Academic Index, this important work is happening all over the country.\n\t \nBackground on Race to the Top:\n\t \n\tThe $4.35 billion Race to the Top Fund is an unprecedented federal investment in reform. The program includes $4 billion for statewide reform grants and $350 million to support states working together to improve the quality of their assessments. The Race to the Top state competition is designed to reward states that are leading the way in comprehensive, coherent, statewide education reform across four key areas:\n\t \n\n\n\t\tAdopting standards and assessments that prepare students to succeed in college and the workplace;\n\n\t\tBuilding data systems that measure student growth and success, and inform teachers and principals how to improve instruction;\n\n\t\tRecruiting, developing, rewarding, and retaining effective teachers and principals, especially where they are needed most; and\n\n\t\tTurning around their lowest-performing schools.\n\n\nBackground on Award Timeline:\n\n\n\t\tMarch 29th, 2010: Delaware and Tennessee were announced as winners of the first phase of the competition\n\n\t\tJune 14th, 2010: Delaware received the first 12.5% of its award\n\n\t\tJuly 22nd, 2010: Delaware received the remainder of its award\n\n\t\tAugust 24th, 2010: the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Rhode Island were announced as winners of the second phase of the competition\n\n\nYear One Accomplishments in Delaware:\n\t \nTeacher Collaboration:\n\tAs part of the application process, the Delaware State Education Association (DSEA) and all 19 of its local affiliates signed on to the State’s application. DSEA and its locals have continued to be very involved in implementation:\n\n\n\t\tOver 300 educators helped develop student growth measures in 30 content areas, building student performance into teacher assessment.\n\n\t\tEducators helped develop plans for the 90 minute collaborative planning time so that all educators in core subjects will meet in small, relevant groups for 90 minutes weekly to identify best practices and coordinate lesson plans. Teachers will also work with data coaches two times a month beginning next year to make sure that metrics on student achievement are informing their teaching.\n\n\t\tThe DSEA worked closely and continuously with the Governor and State Secretary of Education over the past year in overseeing the implementation process and troubleshooting problems that arose.\n\n\nAdditional areas of progress:\n\n\n\t\tDelaware adopted the Common Core Standards for math and English Language Arts and trained 9,000 teachers on the basics of these new standards.\n\n\t\tDelaware launched an online assessment system to measure student progress in a timely and reliable manner so teachers can use it to inform their instruction.\n\n\t\tDelaware recently entered into a contract with Wireless Generation, LLC to provide data coaching services so that, by this spring, teachers in an initial 6 districts and 1 charter school will have regular access to data coaches that will help them use the information from the online assessment system to enrich their instruction and improve student performance.\n\n\t\tDelaware instituted a new Partnership Zone which targets the lowest-achieving schools.  The State has approved the first four Partnership Zone schools’ reform plans which include adopting longer school days and school years, increasing instructional time, requiring leadership and staffing changes and gaining flexibility in staffing decisions, use of lead partners, and other critical changes.\n\n\t\tDelaware designed and instituted a nine-month professional development program to provide districts with the skills to continue to implement their portion of the Race to the Top plan over the next three years.\n\n\nBackground on Howard High School of Technology:\n\n\n\t\tHoward High School of Technology is an 860-student school located three blocks from the downtown Wilmington business district.\n\n\t\tHoward High School’s building was declared a National Historic Landmark due to the role the school played in the civil rights movement. Howard first opened in 1867 and was the only institution in the four-state area of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania to offer a complete high school education to Black students and was one of the earliest Black secondary schools in the Nation. Howard was also one of the schools involved in Brown vs. Board of Education.\n\n\t\tThe student population is 74 percent African-American, 14 percent Caucasian and 1 percent Asian. Sixty-one percent of the student body is low income.\n\n\t\tMore than half of the students who accept admission to Howard have not previously met grade-level math and/or reading standards on state assessments.\n\n\nHoward’s Race to the Top Progress:\n\n\n\t\tHoward High School was selected as one of the first four schools in the state’s Partnership Zone program. Since its selection, Howard has put together and the state has approved a transformation plan to turn around the school.\n\n\t\tTeachers at the school have developed and agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding that modifies the collective bargaining agreement for teachers at the school, allowing for implementation of the transformation plan.\n\n\t\tA new principal has been put in place.\n\n\t\tThere is a high level of educator engagement with 40 faculty currently serving on committees that are developing specific details of the Partnership Zone plan\n\n\t\tIn April, a site-based parent coordinator will be hired to increase parent outreach and support services, especially targeting families of students struggling.\n\n\t\tThis summer, the school will launch a Summer Intensive Learning and Leadership Academy for underperforming students entering the 9th grade.\n\n\t\tNext year the daily schedule for grades 9 and 10 will be restructured into small learning communities. Students will stay together for their core classes and teams of teachers will collaborate on individual student needs and tie vocational coursework to what students are studying in their academic classes.\n\n\t\tDelaware will offer incentives to attract highly qualified academic teachers to Howard.\n\n\t\tThis year, the University of Delaware launched a new STEM residency program, funded, in part, by the Race to the Top Award. The program places science and math experts in residency teaching programs at Delaware high schools, where they work with a certified teacher while they pursue graduate courses in education at the University of Delaware. The program placed eight teachers this year, including five at Howard.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
