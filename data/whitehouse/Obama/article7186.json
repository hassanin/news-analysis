Thousands of gays and lesbians serve our country every day in the federal government. They, and their spouses and children, deserve the same respect and protection as every other family.\n\n\tUnder the leadership of Attorney General Holder, we will continue to move as quickly as possible to fully implement the Court's decision.\n\n\n\n\n"
