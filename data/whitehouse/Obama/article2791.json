It’s the right thing to do for our environment and for our economy.\n\n\tLike parks across the country, Carlsbad and Yosemite are important economic drivers in their communities. In fact, our national parks, forests and other public lands and waters attract visitors from all over the world, fueling local economies and supporting an estimated $646 billion national outdoor economy. In 2015, more than 305 million people visited America’s national parks – setting an all-time record – with visitors spending $16.9 billion in nearby local communities.\n\n\tThe President understands that we have the responsibility to protect our natural and cultural heritage for future generations, in no small part because conservation and outdoor recreation drive our economy. Studies have shown that every dollar invested in the National Park Service generates $10 for the economy through visitor spending, and those national parks, monuments and other protected public lands help contribute to local communities by supporting jobs, boosting tourism, and attracting new businesses and residents who believe that easy outdoor access improves their quality of life. \n\n\tThe Obama Administration is committed to taking bold steps to invest in our national parks and public lands as engines of economic growth.\n\n\tToday, the Department of Interior (DOI) is releasing its annual economic report for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 showing that the Department’s activities associated with outdoor recreation, conservation, water and renewable energy led to $106 billion in economic output, and supported 862,000 jobs. Additionally, the report found that America’s national parks, national wildlife refuges, national monuments and other public lands managed by DOI hosted an estimated 443 million recreational visits in 2015 – up from 423 million in 2014 – and that these visits alone supported $45 billion in economic output and about 396,000 jobs nationwide.\n\n\tUnder President Obama’s leadership, the Administration has also made great progress measuring and highlighting the true value of the outdoor economy, increasing access to outdoor recreation opportunities and protecting America’s public lands and waters to boost local economies: \n\n\n\t\t Increasing Access to Outdoor Recreation: Today, the U.S. Forest Service is announcing new steps to make it easier for Americans to get outside and enjoy their public lands and national forests. By modernizing their special-use permitting process, the Forest Service intends to make it simpler for outfitters, guides, and other organizations to take school groups and others into the outdoors to enjoy activities like fishing, camping, boating, and hiking.  This strategy will help many people, including young people, disadvantaged youth, first-time visitors, and others, to build a connection to their public lands and waters.\n\nMeasuring the Outdoor Economy: In April, the Department of the Interior announced that, for the first time, the federal government will begin to measure the economic impact of outdoor recreation on the American economy. Responding to calls from outdoor businesses that their jobs deserve to be counted alongside other significant economic sectors, the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis will begin to formally recognize the contributions and value of our national outdoor economy.\n\nProtecting Public Lands and Waters to Boost Local Economies: Since taking office, President Obama has protected more land and water than any Administration in history – more than 265 million acres.  Of these, President Obama’s monument designations were supported by hundreds of local businesses and visitors, generating millions of dollars for local economies every year. In addition to these national monuments, President Obama has protected public lands and waters by signing legislation protecting wilderness areas and thousands of miles of rivers and trails as well as by creating and expanding National Marine Sanctuaries.  \n\n\n\tIn addition to these actions building America’s outdoor economy, President Obama has a strong record protecting our nation’s land, water and wildlife:\n\n\n\t\tEncouraged every kid to experience our great outdoors, including launching the “Every Kid in a Park” initiative to provide all fourth-grade students and their families free admission to all public lands and waters. More\n\n\t\tCelebrated 99 victories for wildlife conservation, including overseeing more recoveries under the Endangered Species Act than under any previous administration. More\n\n\t\tProtected national parks and historic sites that are culturally and historically significant to diverse communities of Americans. More\n\n\t\tDeveloped an aggressive program to combat illegal fishing, enforce fishery rules and promote sustainable fisheries. More\n\n\t\tDedicated unprecedented attention and resources to restoring iconic places like the Chesapeake Bay, California Bay-Delta, Great Lakes, and Everglades. More\n\n\t\tReformed energy development on America’s public lands and waters, including implementing new landscape-level planning across the country. More\n\n\t\tDefended iconic landscapes and natural treasures, including by taking action to block damaging uranium mining around the Grand Canyon, formally recommending to Congress that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be protected as wilderness, and designating Alaska’s Bristol Bay as off limits from future oil and gas leasing. More\n\n\t\tTook unprecedented steps to prevent wildlife trafficking, including by implementing the strongest environmental standards in an international trade deal and instituting a near-total ban on the domestic commercial trade of African elephant ivory. More\n\n\t\tEstablished the Gulf Restoration Council through the RESTORE Act, bringing five states and six Federal agencies together to restore Gulf Coast ecosystems and communities. More\n\n\n\tAs we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the creation of American’s national park system and natural treasures across the country, the Administration is committed to protecting iconic landscapes, enhancing local economies and encourage all Americans to “Find Your Park.” Here’s what America’s natural parks mean to each state:\n\nEconomics of America’s National Parks by State (2015):
