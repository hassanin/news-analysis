She was a strong voice to keep children safe from drugs, and she reached out to give comfort to fellow cancer survivors, communities touched by gun violence, and families as they cared for a loved one on the lonely walk of Alzheimer's. That's who she gave voice to in her service to our country. And together, she and our 40th president gave meaning to a poet's words:\n\n\t\"Come live with me and be my love/And we will all the pleasures prove.\"\n\n\tNancy and Ronald Reagan proved those pleasures for more than half a century. They are now together to prove them once again.\n\n\tJill and I offer our deepest condolences to Patti, Ron, Michael, and the entire Reagan family. \n\n\n\n\n"
