When he entered Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School (WHEELS) in the sixth grade, he still spoke and understood very limited English. Now a high school senior, Estiven is one of the top students in his class and will attend Dickinson College in the fall on a Posse Foundation Scholarship, making him a first-generation college student. “At only 16, 17 years old, he, in many ways, embodies the spirit of a life-long learner. He is a model student,” said Erick Espin, Estiven’s 11th grade United States history teacher. Outside of his academic studies, Estiven is also a member of the school’s math club, and soccer and track teams. Earlier this month, Estiven attended an event at the White House on expanding college opportunity.  His story underscores the importance of the President’s goal to give all kids a chance to get ahead, regardless of the circumstances of their birth.\nJohn Soranno (St. Paul, MN) \nCEO, Punch Pizza\nAs a child growing up in Milan, Italy, John Soranno fell in love with pizza.  He hung out at a local pizzeria and dreamed of one day opening his own. After moving to the United States to finish his schooling, John founded Punch Pizza in Minnesota in 1996 and is currently co-owner with John Puckett, with whom he partnered in 2001. The company has expanded to eight locations in Minnesota. John and John are determined to grow a strong company built to last over the long term. To do so, they’re focused not only on how they treat their customers, but also on how they treat their employees. So last year, John and John raised the company-wide minimum wage to $10 to demonstrate how much they value their workers, and it’s been a good business move, too – the company is set to open a ninth store this summer.\nNick Chute (Minneapolis, MN)\nKitchen Worker, Punch Pizza\nA year and a half ago, Nick Chute  started working at Punch Pizza as a cashier to help pay for school and rent. In December, Nick graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in philosophy. He is still with Punch Pizza, currently working as a “pizzaioli in training,” learning to cook pizzas in the traditional Neapolitan style -- in an 800 degree wood-fired oven in under 90 seconds. Punch Pizza’s decision to raise their company-wide minimum wage benefitted Nick, who said “I appreciate it, and it makes me feel like a bigger part of the company.” After becoming a certified pizzaioli, Nick hopes to move into a management position at Punch Pizza.\nPreviously Announced Guests:\nCarlos Arredondo and Jeff Bauman (Boston, MA)\n\tSurvivors of the Boston Marathon Bombing\n\tCarlos Arredondo and Jeff Bauman are forever linked due to the attacks on the 117th Boston Marathon.

After losing both legs in the attack, he is battling back, describing himself as a quick healer and stronger now than he was before the attack. Jeff, 27, and Carlos, 53 and a Gold Star Father, have become close friends.\nAliana Arzola-Piñero (San Juan, Puerto Rico)\n\t2013 Kids State Dinner Attendee\n\tAliana Arzola-Piñero, from San Juan, Puerto Rico, is in fourth grade at the Colegio Puertorriqueño de Niñas.

Last year he received temporary relief from deportation through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The 23-year-old Arizona resident started volunteering with Mi Familia Vota, a non-profit Latino civic engagement program, at the age of 16, and he was one of the core fasters in the Fast for Families demonstration late last year at the foot of the Capitol, which the President, Vice President, First Lady and Cabinet and Administration officials visited.

That all changed on January 1, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Two days later, Amanda began having severe pain in her abdomen, which at first she ignored – something she was used to doing because she was previously uninsured. The next day, when the pain became too much to bear, she went to the emergency room and eventually had emergency abdominal surgery. Amanda is one of millions of Americans who now knows the security that comes with quality, affordable health insurance. \n\nAntoinette Tuff (Atlanta, GA)\n\tDeKalb County Bookkeeper\n\tOn August 20, 2013, the world learned of the compassion and heroism of Antoinette Tuff, the DeKalb County bookkeeper who prevented a shooting at Ronald E.

Now, instead of being known for another tragic school shooting, August 20, 2013 is remembered for one woman’s grace under pressure. The President called Tuff after the ordeal and has said what she did was “remarkable.” Antoinette has been nominated for the Carnegie Medal for civilian heroism.\n\n\n\n\n"
