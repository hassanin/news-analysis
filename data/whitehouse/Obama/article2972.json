These individuals were chosen from more than 900 nominations. The event will feature remarks by White House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell, and Director of National Drug Control Policy Michael Botticelli. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy will host a discussion with Allison Janney, Emily Osment, and Chuck Lorre from the Warner Bros. Television-produced CBS comedy series Mom.\n\n\tAs part of today’s event, and in coordination with the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 191 schools of nursing at the academic institutions listed below announced that beginning in fall 2016 they will require their advanced practice registered nursing students to take some form of prescriber education by the time they graduate, in line with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. Also today, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy announced that 54 colleges and schools of pharmacy will educate all their students about life-saving overdose interventions, including how to counsel patients and others on the appropriate use of naloxone.\n\n\tAs detailed below, the Federal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force is holding its first meeting today to advance access to treatment and promote compliance with health coverage parity implementation. Tomorrow the Drug Enforcement Administration will hold its 11th National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, providing a safe, convenient, and responsible way of disposing of unneeded prescription drugs — including opioids and other controlled substances — in communities across the country.  \n\n\tTo address the national prescription opioid and heroin overdose epidemic, the Administration has been working to expand the use of tools that are effective in reducing drug use and overdose. These include evidence-based prevention programs, prescriber education, prescription drug monitoring, safe drug disposal, medication-assisted treatment, and the overdose reversal drug naloxone.\n\n\tLast month, President Obama joined nearly 2,000 individuals in recovery, family members, medical professionals, law enforcement officials, and other leaders at the National Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit. There he announced new public and private sector actions and reiterated his call to Congress for $1.1 billion in new funding to help every American with an opioid use disorder who wants treatment get the help they need.  \n\nThe Champions of Change for Advancing Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery\n\nAnita Bradley – Cleveland, Ohio\n\tAnita Bradley is the founder and Executive Director of the Northern Ohio Recovery Association. She has been in recovery from a substance abuse disorder for over 25 years and understands the importance and magnitude of blending personal and professional knowledge to promote the power and possibility of recovery. Anita built a Peer-to-Peer training program offered at a local community college and opened the Next Step Recovery House, a residential recovery housing facility on Cleveland’s near west side. Anita also recently launched a Statewide Network for Addiction to respond to the opioid crisis and ensure that the voice for recovery from substance use disorders is included in planning and policy efforts in Ohio. Anita was named winner of the 2015 Women Who Excel Entrepreneur Award by Smart Business Magazine and is a recipient of the Joel Hernandez Community Recovery Award.\n\nLeonard Campanello – Gloucester, Massachusetts\n\tLeonard Campanello is the Chief of Police in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Chief Campanello has worked to end the stigma of addiction by adding law enforcement's voice to those suffering with substance use disorders. In May 2015, in response to the growing epidemic of opioid use disorders, he announced a policy change that allows those with substance use disorders to ask for help and treatment resources from the Gloucester Police Department by walking into the station, with or without drugs, and without being charged with a crime. The policy also provided free naloxone (the opioid overdose reversal drug) for anyone in need. In the 10 months since it began, the Gloucester Program reports that it has brought 425 people directly to treatment with no criminal penalty and no solicitation of information, and has reduced crime and costs associated with substance use disorders in Gloucester and rebuilt the trust between the police and the community. The policy’s success led to the creation of the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative, which facilitates the proliferation of the Gloucester Program to over 100 communities in 22 States and partnerships with 250 treatment centers and growing.\n\nLeslie Hayes – Española, New Mexico\n\tLeslie Hayes, MD, works for El Centro Family Health in Espanola, New Mexico, as a family practitioner. El Centro Family Health is a community health center with clinics located throughout northern New Mexico – a rural, underserved area. While Dr. Hayes enjoys all aspects of family medicine, her particular passion is taking care of people with opioid use disorders. She works with pregnant women and new mothers who have substance use disorders to make sure that they and their babies receive compassionate and appropriate medical care. Leslie received much of her training in substance use disorders through Project ECHO, a program that uses telecommunication to link specialists with primary care providers. Leslie considers herself extremely fortunate to have been able to give back to Project ECHO, and she now provides training for other providers around the State of New Mexico in substance use disorder and use of the medication-assisted treatment buprenorphine.\n\nTom Hedrick – New York, New York\n\tTom Hedrick is one of the founding members of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids (“the Partnership”). Since its founding, the Partnership has focused on delivering evidence-based prevention communication messages through the media, becoming the largest single-issue public service communications program in America during a period of dramatic reductions in substance use among adolescents. Tom helped expand the program to include evidence-based resources and support for parents and caregivers in prevention, intervention, treatment, and recovery through a web-based platform and a toll-free Helpline. With Tom’s help, the Partnership is piloting a peer support program to recruit and train experienced parents and caregivers to coach other parents and caregivers who have discovered that their kids have a substance use disorder. The coaching has been integrated with the online resources and the Helpline into a national Parent Support Network.\n\nAndre Johnson – Detroit, Michigan\n\tAndre Johnson is the founder, President, and CEO of the Detroit Recovery Project (DRP), a recovery community organization providing peer-led, peer-run, and peer-driven services in Detroit. Andre has been in long-term recovery from a substance use disorder for nearly 28 years. Over the past ten years, Andre has secured over $15 million dollars in Federal, county, State, and local grants for DRP to provide quality prevention, treatment, and recovery services. Andre was appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Health & Human Services to serve on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration/Center for Substance Abuse Treatment National Advisory Council. He also sits on the board of the College for Behavioral Health Leadership. \n\nShawn Lang – Hartford, Connecticut\n\tShawn M. Lang is the Deputy Director of AIDS Connecticut (ACT). Shawn has been with ACT since 1991, where she coordinates HIV/AIDS public policy activities on the State and Federal levels, including chairing the AIDS LIFE Campaign, Connecticut’s AIDS policy group. Shawn also oversees ACT’s care and treatment programs, prevention programs, and member services, and provides a variety of trainings and presentations.  She is on the board of the National AIDS Housing Coalition and a member of the Community Advisory Board of the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS, and was recently appointed to the Connecticut Alcohol and Drug Policy Council. Since 2013, Shawn has chaired Connecticut’s Statewide Opiate Overdose Prevention Workgroup, which has engaged in an extensive advocacy campaign to increase awareness about and access to naloxone, a lifesaving medication that reverses opioid overdoses.  She has been a longstanding activist on issues impacting battered women, LGBT communities, homelessness, and HIV/AIDS.  She lives in Hartford with her 18-year-old son.\n\nJulio Medina – Bronx, New York\n\tJulio Medina is the founder and Executive Director of Exodus Transitional Community, a reentry program in East Harlem, Newburgh, Poughkeepsie, and Albany, New York. Julio spent twelve years in prison on drugs charges in the 1980s and 90s. As the Founder and Executive Director of Exodus Transitional Community, Julio addresses the widespread struggle of substance use disorders, often linked to incarceration and recidivism. Under Julio’s leadership, Exodus Transitional Community employs a holistic approach to substance use disorders with the aim of tackling all of the stages of addiction, including prevention, treatment, recovery, and relapse. Julio also works to promote effective local, State and Federal policies aimed at substance use disorders, while increasing access to services that support men, women, and their families.  Most recently, Julio was appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to serve on the Community Reentry and Reintegration Council, and by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to serve on the Alternatives to Incarceration Council.\n\nJustin Phillips – Indianapolis, Indiana\n\tJustin Phillips, MA is the Founder and Executive Director of Overdose Lifeline, Inc., an Indiana non-profit dedicated to reducing the stigma of addiction and preventing deaths resulting from opioid overdose. Justin started the nonprofit in 2014 following the loss of her 20-year-old son Aaron to a heroin overdose. Overdose Lifeline established a support network for families impacted by opioid use disorders and helps to purchase naloxone, an opioid reversal drug, for first-responders in the Indianapolis area. Justin also worked with Indiana legislators on a bill known as Aaron’s Law to expand access to naloxone prescriptions for others beyond first responders. Justin’s advocacy efforts were realized with the enactment of Aaron’s Law in April 2015, making it legal for naloxone to be made available in pharmacies across Indiana without a physician’s prescription. Overdose Lifeline has distributed over 300 naloxone overdose reversal kits to families and individuals and developed a prevention education program for the State of Indiana.\n\nJustin Luke Riley – Denver, Colorado\n\tJustin Luke Riley serves as president and CEO of Young People in Recovery (YPR), a national grassroots organization focused on peer-to-peer services for young people in, or seeking, recovery from substance use disorder. Riley is 28 years old and has been in long-term recovery from a substance use disorder since 2007.

clinicians on the CDC Guideline.\n\n\tThe CDC Guideline provides recommendations for clinicians on appropriate prescribing, including determining if and when to start prescription opioids for chronic pain treatment; guidance on medication selection, dose, and duration, including when to discontinue medication, if needed; and guidance to help assess the benefits and risks and address the harms of prescription opioid use.\n\n\tAlso today, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy announced that 54 colleges and schools of pharmacy will educate all their students about life-saving overdose interventions, including how to counsel patients and others on the appropriate use of naloxone.

The President established the Task Force last month to advance access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment and promote compliance with mental health and substance use disorder parity implementation.  Federal parity protections are intended to ensure that health plans’ coverage of mental health and substance use disorder benefits is comparable to their coverage of medical and surgical benefits.  \n\nNational Prescription Drug Take-Back Day\n\n\tTomorrow, the Drug Enforcement Administration will hold its 11th National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, providing a safe, convenient, and responsible way of disposing of unneeded prescription drugs — including opioids and other controlled substances — in communities across the country.  More than 5.5 million pounds of medication have been collected over the last ten Take Back Days.  \n\n\tLocal communities are also establishing ongoing drug take-back programs, and to support these efforts, Walgreens is installing safe medication disposal kiosks in more than 500 drugstores across the country, primarily at locations open 24 hours.\n\nBackground on Administration Actions on Opioids\n\n\tIn October 2015, as part of his visit to West Virginia to discuss the prescription opioid abuse and heroin epidemic, the President announced a number of new public and private sector actions, including a Presidential Memorandum requiring Federal Departments to provide training on appropriate opioid prescribing to Federal health care professionals and requiring Departments to develop plans to address barriers to opioid use disorder treatment in Federal programs. Departments are ahead of schedule in fulfilling the President’s directive that Federal agencies ensure that all employees who prescribe these drugs are trained in appropriate opioid prescribing practices by 2017.  In addition, since the President’s Memorandum was released, Departments have taken numerous steps to expand access to opioid use disorder treatment, including medication-assisted treatment.\n\n\tFor example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently issued a proposed rule to increase the current patient limit for qualified physicians who prescribe buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorders from 100 to 200 patients with the goal of expanding access to this evidence-based treatment while preventing diversion.  The proposed rule aims to increase access to medication-assisted treatment and behavioral health supports for thousands of people with opioid use disorders.   \n\n\tHHS also released $94 million in new funding to 271 Community Health Centers across the country earlier this month to increase substance use disorder treatment services, with a specific focus on expanding medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorders in underserved communities.  This funding is expected to help health centers treat nearly 124,000 new patients with substance use disorders.\n\n\tEarlier this week, HHS issued new guidance to give as many as 96,000 Americans transitioning from incarceration back to their communities access to health care through Medicaid, including mental health and substance use disorder treatment. Historically, the vast majority of justice-involved individuals have been uninsured, and roughly half of incarcerated individuals struggle with mental health conditions and substance use disorder. Uninterrupted access to health care coverage can help lower health care costs, hospitalizations and emergency department visits, as well as the risk of re-incarceration.\n\n\tThese actions build on efforts that began in 2010 when the President released his first National Drug Control Strategy, which emphasized the need for action to address opioid use disorders and overdose while ensuring that individuals with pain receive safe, effective treatment.  In 2011, the White House released its national Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan, which outlined goals for addressing prescription drug abuse and overdose.  \n\n\tSince then, the Administration has supported and expanded efforts to prevent drug use, pursue “smart on crime” approaches to drug enforcement, improve prescribing practices for pain medication, increase access to treatment, work to reduce overdose deaths, and support the millions of Americans in recovery.\n\n\t \n\nThe Champions of Change program was created as an opportunity for the White House to feature individuals doing extraordinary things to empower and inspire members of their communities. The event will be streamed live on obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/live. To learn more about the White House Champions of Change program, visit obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/champions.
