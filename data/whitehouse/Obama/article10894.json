Pistole to review the many enhancements that have been made to both aviation and surface transportation security. Today’s briefing was held in conjunction with the President’s regularly scheduled counterterrorism and homeland security briefing and was not prompted by any specific or credible threat.\n\t \n\tThe President was briefed on DHS’ strategic plans, including near-term efforts to improve security and minimize risk with a focus on mass transit and passenger rail security. A significant aspect of TSA’s security enhancements over the past year have included improved technology and procedures, strengthened partnerships with transportation stakeholders and expanded engagement with the international community.\n\t \n\tThe President stressed that DHS emphasis on mass transit and passenger rail security measures is a priority and again asked Secretary Napolitano and Administrator Pistole if they need anything.\n\t \n\tTo view a photograph of the President’s briefing with Secretary Napolitano and Administrator Pistole click HERE.\n\n\n\n\n"
