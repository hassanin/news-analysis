This winter, I took my granddaughter to Dachau, just as I had taken each of my own children as they came of age. Young people need to understand what happened. They need to feel a sense of personal duty to carry forward the mission of making sure it never happens again.\nToo often “never again” has been used in lament—as a statement of regret over responses that were insufficient or came too late. These words must inspire reflection and, more importantly, action. We must continue to derive strength and courage from them and recommit ourselves to the work of making sure these atrocities can never be repeated. We must actively fight the scourge of bigotry and anti-Semitism wherever it occurs. \nFinally, the survivors we honor today have made extraordinary contributions to the fabric of life in the United States and around the world--and many are still in need. They deserve our admiration and our care.\n\n\n\n\n"
