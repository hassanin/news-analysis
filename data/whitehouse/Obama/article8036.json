The President noted the extensive damage in areas across the Gulf Coast and told the officials that they – as well as the communities they represent -- were in his thoughts and prayers. The President also made clear that he had directed FEMA to continue to bring all available resources to bear to support response and recovery efforts. FEMA teams have been on the ground in both states since before the storm made landfall and federal responders continue to move  supplies – including water, meals, generators, medical supplies and other resources – into affected areas in both states as conditions allow. Teams from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Department of Energy are supporting power supply and restoration efforts.\n\n\t \n\n\tAt the requests of the Governors, the President approved Emergency Declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi earlier this week, and on Wednesday night the President provided expedited Major Disaster declarations for both states which make additional federal resources available to the state and local governments. On the call the President informed the Louisiana Parish Presidents and Louisiana Mayors that today he approved the addition of Individual Assistance to the state’s Disaster Declaration, making federal funding available directly to affected individuals in impacted areas. The President asked the officials to continue to identify needs that may arise as the response efforts continue and recovery efforts begin.\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\n"
