Today we welcomed her to the White House to meet with White House staff, including Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Western Hemisphere Affairs Ricardo Zuniga, to discuss her efforts to promote increased respect for freedom of expression in Cuba.  The United States looks forward to the day when all Cubans will have the opportunity to express themselves in public without fear and we will continue to support policies that encourage the free flow of information to, from, and within Cuba.\n\n\n\n\n"
