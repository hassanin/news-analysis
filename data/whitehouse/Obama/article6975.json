conducting border guard training in Belarus and Georgia, in conjunction with Estonia and Lithuania; and providing training to the Georgian armed forces.  Additionally, Latvia conducts economic development and rule of law projects in Moldova through the U.S.-Latvia Agreement on Supporting Justice Sector Reform in Moldova, which was signed in June 2012. \n\n\nGlobal Cooperation:  Latvia has been a strong ally in advancing human rights and democratic values around the world.  Latvia has taken a leading role in encouraging democratic reforms in Belarus and helping Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova integrate more fully into European institutions.  Latvia deploys seamen to the EU-led anti-piracy and anti-robbery Operation ATALANTA off the coast of Somalia and provides military training in Mali. \n\n\nEconomic, Energy, and Environmental Cooperation:\n\n\nEnergy Security:  Latvia actively pursues a national strategy of energy diversification.  A key portion of Latvia’s energy diversification strategy involves the promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency.  With half of its territory covered by forests, wood biomass is one of the primary fields for development.  Latvian companies are pursuing U.S. technology and partnerships in wind power, biomass gasification, and waste energy solutions.  These efforts support the Latvian government’s commitment to produce 40 percent of total energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020.   \n\n\nTrade, Investment, and Jobs:  Bilateral trade in goods between the United States and Latvia totaled $760 million in 2012.  Coal and petroleum gases, machinery, and vehicles are among the United States’ major exports to Latvia.  Recent partnerships between U.S. and Latvian businesses have been concentrated in the information technology, transportation and logistics, energy, and heavy industry sectors.  The government of Latvia has expressed strong support for the U.S.-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) negotiations.  T-TIP aims to boost economic growth in the United States and in the EU and add to the more than 13 million American and EU jobs already supported by transatlantic trade and investment.  In May, Latvia was selected to receive a roadmap for membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Latvia will formally adopt the euro on January 1, 2014. \n\n\nEducational and Cultural Ties:\n\n\nEducational Exchange Programs:  Since 1991, the United States has awarded Fulbright fellowships to 177 outstanding scholars and students from Latvia to study and conduct research in the United States.  Each year, approximately eight Latvian students and scholars travel to the United States.  Additionally, in the past 20 years, more than 150 U.S. Fulbright scholars and students have conducted research and lectured at universities in Latvia.    \n\n\nCultural Programs:  A robust series of cultural exchanges between the United States and Latvia in the fields of music, literature, humanities, and museum communities have strengthened ties between American and Estonian societies.  Latvians and Americans share a deep appreciation for music.  This year, internationally acclaimed Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons was appointed the music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  Well-known American Jazz musicians regularly visit Latvia.  Recent performers include Bobby McFarrin, Liz Wright, Christian McBride, and Medeski, Martin & Wood.  \n\n\nProfessional Exchange Programs:  Since 1991, 412 Latvians have participated in the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP), the Department of State’s premier professional exchange program, which brings current and emerging foreign leaders in a variety of fields to the United States to experience this country firsthand and cultivate lasting relationships with their American counterparts. In addition, approximately 300 Latvians took part in privately funded professional exchanges with the United States last year, including the Summer Work Travel, Intern, College and University Student, and Camp Counselor programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
