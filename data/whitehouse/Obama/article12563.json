The Medicare Physician Payment Reform Act includes key provisions to update the payment system – including eliminating the steep payment cut scheduled for 2010, consistent with the President's FY 2010 budget proposal. The bill also increases payments for evaluation and management services and encourages the formation of accountable care organizations.\nPresident Obama is also gratified that the House included statutory Pay-as-You-Go legislation in this package. Statutory PAYGO is an important, commonsense tool to help re-establish fiscal discipline in Washington, a principle that the President has long supported – particularly with respect to health care reform.\nThis legislation is an important step forward, and the Administration will continue to work with Congress to achieve comprehensive reforms, ensure choice and high-quality care for beneficiaries, and restore fiscal discipline in our legislative process.”\n\n\n\n"
