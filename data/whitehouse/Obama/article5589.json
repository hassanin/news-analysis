The efforts announced today – along with our current supporters’ efforts – will help us show more people that you are what you drink, and when you drink water you Drink Up,” said PHA CEO Lawrence A. Soler.  “We applaud the efforts of each of these supporters toward helping us take another step closer to providing access to water for more people wherever they are, whenever they want it, however they want it – be it tap, filtered or bottled.” \nFor complete information about this PHA commitment, visit AHealthierAmerica.org and YouAreWhatYouDrink.org. \n\n\n\n\n"
