The report lays out the economic landscape facing women today and details some of the many ways the administration is committed to making sure the government is working for all Americans especially American women.  The President will highlight this report at the event.  The full report is available HERE .\n\t \nBackground on Host Family\n\t \nFoss Family\n\tErik and Cynnie Foss are parents to Anna (8 years old) and Elsa (5 years old) and have been married for 14 years.  Erik was born and raised in Seattle and is a general contractor, specializing in home remodels.  Cynnie was born and raised in Bellevue and is the Volunteer Services Manager at the University of Washington Medical Center.  Both of their children attend View Ridge Elementary School.  \n\t \n Background on women small business owners\n\t \n Jody Hall, Owner, Cupcake Royale\n\tJody Hall is the owner of Cupcake Royale, which opened in 2003 and has grown to five locations throughout Seattle.  Jody self-financed her first café/bakery and based on its success was able to open subsequent locations.  With the help of a SBA 504 loan,  Jody was able to purchase the space for her fourth location.  Her fifth location recently opened last month.
