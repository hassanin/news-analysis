On July 28, 1998, the President issued E.O. 13094, amending E.O. 12938, to respond more effectively to the worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation activities. On June 28, 2005, the President issued E.O. 13382, which, inter alia, further amended E.O. 12938, to improve our ability to combat proliferation. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States; therefore, the national emergency first declared on November 14, 1994, and extended in each subsequent year, must continue. In accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938.\nThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\nBARACK OBAMA\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tNovember 7, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n"
