Security Council resolution will continue, noting that Iran’s persistent refusal to meet with the P5+1 on Iran’s nuclear program and recent refusal to halt enriching uranium to nearly 20 percent, do not build confidence.  The President and Prime Minister also discussed the ongoing government formation process in Iraq and the need to advance peace in the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\n"
