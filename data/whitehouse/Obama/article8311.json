The educators will receive their awards in Washington, DC later this month.\n\n\tThe Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching is awarded annually to outstanding K-12 science and mathematics teachers from across the country. The winners are selected by a panel of distinguished scientists, mathematicians, and educators following an initial selection process done at the state level. Each year the award alternates between teachers teaching kindergarten through 6th grade and those teaching 7th through 12th grades. The 2011 awardees named today teach 7th through 12th grades.\n\n\tWinners of this Presidential honor receive a $10,000 award from the National Science Foundation to be used at their discretion. They also are invited Washington, DC, for an awards ceremony and several days of educational and celebratory events, including visits with members of Congress and the Administration.\n\n\tPresident Obama has committed to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and prepare 100,000 effective science and mathematics teachers over the next decade. These commitments build on the President’s “Educate to Innovate” campaign, which has attracted more than $700 million in donations and in-kind support from corporations, philanthropies, service organizations, and others to help bolster science and technology education in the classroom.\n\n\t“America’s success in the 21st century depends on our ability to educate our children, give our workers the skills they need, and embrace technological change. That starts with the men and women in front of our classrooms. These teachers are the best of the best, and they stand as excellent examples of the kind of leadership we need in order to train the next generation of innovators and help this country get ahead,” said President Obama.\n\t \nThe recipients of the 2011 Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching are:\n\n\tAlabama\n\tSuzanne Culbreth, Birmingham (Math)\n\tChanda Davis, Huntsville (Science)\n\n\tAlaska\n\tStephanie Cronin, Seward (Math)\n\tJoanna Hubbard, Anchorage (Science)\n\n\tArizona\n\tMichael Frank, Tucson (Science)\n\n\tArkansas\n\tStephanie Muckelberg, Bald Knob (Math)\n\tVickie Logan, Little Rock (Science)\n\n\tCalifornia\n\tKentaro Iwasaki, San Francsico (Math)\n\tDean Baird, Sacramento (Science)\n\n\tColorado\n\tAndrea Wiseman, Denver (Math)\n\tAmy Hanson, Denver (Science)\n\n\tConnecticut\n\tKaren Thomas, Westport (Math)\n\tTyler Hoxley, East Hartford (Science)\n\n\tDelaware\n\tMary Pinkston, Wilmington (Math)\n\tMichael Kaufmann, Wilmington (Science)\n\t \n\tDepartment of Defense Education Activity\n\tSpencer Bean, Baumholder, Germany (Math)\n\n\tDistrict of Columbia\n\tSarah Bax (Math)\n\tWilliam Wallace (Science)\n\n\tFlorida\n\tKathleen Jones, Panama City Beach (Math)\n\tStephen Fannin, Tallahassee (Science)\n\n\tGeorgia\n\tCarol Taylor, Fayetteville (Math)\n\tKelly Stewart, Atlanta (Science)\n\n\tHawaii\n\tCharles Souza, Jr., Honolulu (Math)\n\tJulia Segawa, Honolulu (Science)\n\n\tIdaho\n\tKatie Pemberton, Coeur d'Alene (Math)\n\tJames Jordan, Boise (Science)\n\n\tIllinois\n\tPeter DeCraene, Evanston (Math)\n\tDavid Bonner, Darien (Science)\n\n\tIndiana\n\tNatalie Schneider, Indianapolis (Math)\n\tStacy McCormack, Mishawaka (Science)\n\n\tIowa\n\tKarla Digmann, Dubuque (Math)\n\tJody Stone, Cedar Falls (Science)\n\n\tKansas\n\tAngela Miller, Manhattan (Math)\n\tDennis Burkett, Jr., Olathe (Science)\n\n\tKentucky\n\tAndrea Higdon, Crestwood (Math)\n\tJoshua Underwood, Mt.
