Menino\n\n\n\n\nBoston is the vibrant, welcoming, and world-class city it is today because of Tom Menino.  For more than two decades, Mayor Menino has served the city and every one of its residents with extraordinary leadership, vision, and compassion.  His efforts to revitalize neighborhoods, schools, and businesses, better integrate police officers into their communities and reduce gun violence, reach out to the homeless and marginalized, and engage young people in the life of their city has charted Boston on a course for a better future.  No two people wear their hearts on their sleeve for the City of Boston and its people as openly as Tom and Angela Menino.  And as they depart City Hall next year, Boston will be a better place to live, work and raise a family because of the Meninos’ proud service to the city they love.\n\n\n\n\n"
