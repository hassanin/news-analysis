Founded in 1947, the Hannover Messe attracts approximately 6,500 exhibitors and 200,000 visitors from across the globe each year. The President’s participation – a first for a sitting U.S. President – presents an unique opportunity to showcase American innovation and ingenuity and to highlight the United States as a prime investment destination. While in Germany, the President will address efforts to advance negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. This visit, which will be the President’s fifth to Germany, underscores the enduring political and economic ties between Americans and Germans and highlights the U.S. commitment to trade and investment as drivers of job creation and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\n\n"
