And it is legislation that is fully paid for and will reduce our long-term federal deficit.\nThanks to the hard work of the House, we are just two steps away from achieving health insurance reform in America. Now the United States Senate must follow suit and pass its version of the legislation. I am absolutely confident it will, and I look forward to signing comprehensive health insurance reform into law by the end of the year.\n\n\n\n"
