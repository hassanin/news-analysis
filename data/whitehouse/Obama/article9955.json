The company’s hybrid-propulsion systems for buses are used across the country and have saved more than 17 million gallons of diesel fuel.\n\t \n\tWhen President Obama was elected, America imported 11 million barrels of oil a day.  The President has set a goal of cutting that number by one-third by 2025, with a plan that includes a range of steps to produce more oil domestically while reducing our dependence on oil through cleaner fuels and greater efficiency.  \n\n\tAlready, the Obama Administration has made historic progress through investments in clean energy, new fuel economy standards for cars and light-duty trucks that will save approximately 1.8 billion barrels of oil, and steps toward the first-ever fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.  The President has also called for ending the $4 billion in taxpayer dollars we spend each year subsidizing oil and gas companies and redirecting those funds to invest in clean energy technologies that will further reduce our dependence on oil.\n\n\n\n\n"
