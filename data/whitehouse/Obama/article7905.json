As that lamp is lit, we should all recommit ourselves to bring light to any place still facing darkness.  Earlier this year, we were reminded of the evil that exists in the world when a gunman walked into the Sikh gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin and opened fire.  In the wake of that horrible tragedy, we saw the resilience of a community that drew strength from their faith and a sense of solidarity with their neighbors, Sikh and non-Sikh alike.  We also saw compassion and love, in the heroic actions of the first responders and the outpouring of support from people across the country.  Out of a day of sadness, we were reminded that the beauty of America remains our diversity, and our right to religious freedom.  \n\n\t                                    \n\n\tTo those celebrating Diwali, I wish you, your families and loved ones Happy Diwali and Saal Mubarak.\n\n\n\n\n"
