Schumer Backs American Jobs Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\tU.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) released the following statement Thursday night following President Obama’s joint address to Congress on jobs:\n\n\t“This was a powerful message on jobs, aimed not at the lawmakers in the room, but at the American people. The President’s plan is just what our economy needs, and it will move the country to appeal to its elected representatives to take action on jobs and get the economy moving again.”\n\n\t--U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer \n\n\n\n\n"
