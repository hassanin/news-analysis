Jim is a natural leader of unquestioned integrity.  In the face of ever-changing threats, he has repeatedly demonstrated his commitment to defending America’s security and ideals alike.  With Jim at the Bureau’s helm, I know that the FBI will be in good hands long after I’ve left office.\nAs welcome as today’s vote is, however, the Senate still has work to do.  Like the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is a critical law enforcement agency, and it has been without a confirmed director for far too long.  I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm Todd Jones, my nominee to lead the ATF, so that he and his team can do their part to keep American families safe.  As Senators from both parties recognized today, we cannot allow partisan politics to get in the way of protecting the American people. \n\n\n\n\n"
