How could anyone say no to them? These are bipartisan, middle of the road proposals that have received support from both parties in the past.\n\n\t“We must also remember that we did not dig ourselves into this deep recession overnight and we can’t expect to solve our all problems in the blink of an eye. It took us eight long years to get us into this mess in the first place and it will take us longer than two and a half years to get out.”\n\n\t“The President is committed to creating jobs of the future and rebuilding our economy the right way – based on fairness, hard work, responsibility, and opportunity – not through outsourcing, corporate loopholes, reckless financial deals, or special tax breaks for Big Oil and the wealthy.\n\n\t“The time is now for Congress to put jobs first.”\n\n\tPresident Obama’s plan is fully paid for by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share and by closing corporate tax loopholes. As proposed, the American Jobs Act would:\n\n\n\t\tCut taxes for small businesses to help them hire and grow\n\n\t\tPut more money in the pockets of working Americans\n\n\t\tPut more people back to work – teachers laid off from state budget cuts, veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, first responders, and construction workers rebuilding our roads, bridges, and schools\n\n\t\tHelp the long-term unemployed support their families as they look for work\n\n\n\n\n\n"
