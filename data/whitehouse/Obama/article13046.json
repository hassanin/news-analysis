When this proposal is combined with other proposals that the Senate Finance Committee is working on, it’s estimated that health reform will cover 97% of all Americans. The HELP committee’s success should give us hope, but it should not give us pause.  It should instead provide the urgency for both the House and Senate to finish their critical work on health reform before the August recess.  I want to commend Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd, as well as Senators Harkin, Mikulski, Bingaman, and Murray on the leadership they’ve shown and the foundation they’ve laid to reform our health care system.\" ###   \n\n\n\n"
