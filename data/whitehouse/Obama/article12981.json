The President determined that the actions of certain persons to undermine Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government or democratic institutions; to contribute to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Lebanon, including through politically motivated violence and intimidation; to reassert Syrian control or contribute to Syrian interference in Lebanon, or to infringe upon or undermine Lebanese sovereignty contribute to political and economic instability in that country and the region and constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\n\n\tDespite some positive developments in the past year, including the establishment of diplomatic relations and an exchange of ambassadors between Syria and Lebanon, the actions of certain persons continue to contribute to political and economic instability in Lebanon and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared on August 1, 2007, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond August 1, 2009. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13441.\n\n\tThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tJuly 30, 2009.\n\t\n\t\t# # #\n\t\t \n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\n\n\t\tOffice of the Press Secretary\n\t\t_______________________________________________________________________________\n\t\tFor Immediate Release                                                                  July 30, 2009\n\nTO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:\n\n\tSection 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency declared with respect to the actions of certain persons to undermine the sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic processes and institutions is to continue in effect beyond August 1, 2009.\n\n\tIn the past 6 months, the United States has used dialogue with the Syrian government to address concerns and identify areas of mutual interest, including support for Lebanese sovereignty. Despite some positive developments in the past year, including the establishment of diplomatic relations and an exchange of ambassadors between Lebanon and Syria, the actions of certain persons continue to contribute to political and economic instability in Lebanon and the region and constitute a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared on August 1, 2007, to deal with that threat and the related measures adopted on that date to respond to the emergency.\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tJuly 30, 2009.\n\t\n\t\t# # #\n\n\n\n\n\n"
