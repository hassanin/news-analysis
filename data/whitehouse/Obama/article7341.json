Born in Chandigarh, India, and raised in Lawrence, Kansas, Sri spent nearly two decades as an extraordinary litigator before serving as Principal Deputy Solicitor General of the United States. Now he will serve with distinction on the federal bench. Sri will in fact be the first South Asian American to serve as a circuit court judge in our history.   While I applaud the Senate’s action, it’s important to remember that this confirmation is the first one to this important court in seven years.  The three remaining vacancies must be filled, as well as other vacancies across the country.\n\n\n\n\n"
