The Governor said he appreciates President Obama’s work.\n\t \n\t“I am proud of the fact that the President is working for Iowa’s working families during these extraordinary times,” he said. “Without the extension, more than 8,000 Iowa families were going to lose their benefits during the holiday season.”\n\t \n\tThe Governor also is urging Congress to include in the final tax package the ethanol tax credits.\n\t \n\t“This is critically important for creating new jobs in Iowa,” Culver said. “The ethanol industry is a growth industry that promises good-paying jobs for Iowans now and into the future.”\n\n\n\n\n"
