By rejecting efforts to rollback EPA's common-sense steps to safeguard Americans from harmful pollution, the Senate also rejected an approach that would have increased the nation's dependence on oil, contradicted the scientific consensus on global warming, and jeopardized America's ability to lead the world in the clean energy economy. The Clean Air Act is a vital tool in protecting our families â€“ particularly children - from a wide variety of harmful pollutants that cause asthma and lung disease, and the administration remains committed to protecting this important law.\n\n\n\n\n"
