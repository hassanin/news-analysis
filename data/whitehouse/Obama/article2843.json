Thomson\n\n\n\n\n\n\tYesterday, the President spoke by phone with Major General John (J.T.) Thomson, commanding general of the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas. On behalf of the American people, the President conveyed his deepest sympathies to the families, friends, and colleagues of the soldiers swept away by flash flooding during a terrible training tragedy at Fort Hood, Texas last week.\n\n\tThe President thanked Major General Thomson, the leaders of Fort Hood, and especially the soldiers and emergency responders who coordinated search and recovery operations in treacherous conditions.\n\n\tThis accident reminds us of the tremendous risks associated with military operations in peacetime or at war. The President expressed to Major General Thomson the great debt our nation owes to all service members for the sacrifices they make to keep us all secure.\n\n\tThe President and First Lady are keeping the 1st Cavalry Division and the United States Military Academy in their prayers during this difficult time.\n\n\n\n\n"
