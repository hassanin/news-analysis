For more than two centuries, the meaning of this holiday has inspired an American tradition of religious freedom -- one codified in the Bill of Rights and chronicled in the enduring promise President George Washington made in his letter to the Jews of Newport, Rhode Island: that the United States “gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.”\n\n\tMay the flicker of each flame in every Menorah remind us all of the profound miracles in our own lives. And may the light of hope we shed continue to drive out darkness and brighten the futures we build for our families, our neighbors, our communities, and our world.\n\n\tOn behalf of Michelle and my family, Chanukah Sameach. Happy Hanukkah!\n\n\n\n\n"
