That is why, today, as part of the President’s Better Buildings Program, the Administration is announcing:\n\n\n\t\t18 utilities, serving more than 2.6 million commercial customers, will provide access to energy data building owners by 2017, the first step to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings;\n\n\t\t30 cities and states and 21 organizations from across the country are committing to take new actions to make it easier to identify ways to cut energy waste by making energy data available to building owners,\n\n\t\t24 cities, states, and businesses are committing to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings 20 percent by 2020; and\n\n\t\tSeven cities and states from across the country are committing to install more efficient outdoor lighting. \n\n\n\tThe actions announced today build on commitments made by 285 organizations representing nearly 4 billion square feet since the Administration launched the President’s Better Building program in 2011.  The program’s mission is to partner with the Energy Department to improve energy efficiency 20 percent by 2020, and share successful strategies that maximize efficiency deployment over the next decade. These new commitments from cities, school districts, and businesses like Nike and Wendy’s will help cut waste in our buildings, saving energy and money and reducing pollution.\n\n\tToday's commitments complement the Supreme Court's decision earlier this week on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's authority to enable consumers to get paid for cutting energy demand when prices are high.  This decision allows us to continue realizing billions of dollars in annual savings from demand response measures that help ensure the reliability of our electricity system as we integrate more energy efficiency and renewable energy onto the power grid.\n\nPROVIDING ENERGY DATA SOLUTIONS \n\nUnlocking Utility Energy Data: Through the Better Buildings Energy Data Accelerator (EDA), 18 utilities, serving more than 2.6 million commercial customers and working within their communities, are announcing they will provide whole-building energy data access to building owners by 2017 – significantly expanding building energy benchmarking, the first step many building owners take to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings.\n\n“Better Buildings Accelerator partners demonstrate how powerful a public-private partnership dedicated to solving a specific problem can be,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz. “Bringing energy efficiency to scale is a national priority. We applaud the dedication of our partners to come up with innovative solutions that advance our nation’s ability to reduce carbon emissions, and spur economic savings in our businesses and communities.”\n\n\tThe city-utility partnerships have been successful in overcoming informational barriers to energy efficiency through the development of best-practice approaches that enable building owners to access whole-building energy data as part of the Energy Data Accelerator. The partners are:\n\n\n\t\tCity of Austin, TX – Austin Energy\n\n\t\tCity of Boston, MA – Eversource\n\n\t\tCity of Cambridge, MA – Eversource\n\n\t\tCity of Chicago, IL – Commonwealth Edison\n\n\t\tCity of Chula Vista, CA – San Diego Gas & Electric\n\n\t\tCity of Kansas City, MO – Kansas City Power and Light\n\n\t\tCity of Los Angeles, CA – Los Angeles Department of Water and Power\n\n\t\tCity of Los Angeles, CA – Southern California Gas\n\n\t\tCity of Orlando, FL – Orlando Utilities Commission\n\n\t\tCity of Minneapolis, MN – Xcel Energy\n\n\t\tCity of New York, NY – National Grid\n\n\t\tCity of Philadelphia, PA – PECO Energy Company\n\n\t\tSalt Lake City, UT – Questar\n\n\t\tSalt Lake City, UT– Rocky Mountain Power\n\n\t\tCity of San Diego, CA – San Diego Gas & Electric\n\n\t\tCity of San Francisco, CA – Pacific Gas & Electric\n\n\t\tCity of Santa Monica, CA – Southern California Edison\n\n\t\tCity of Seattle, WA – Puget Sound Energy\n\n\t\tDistrict of Columbia – PEPCO\n\n\nProviding Technical Assistance to Streamline Energy Data: Today, DOE is announcing they will be providing technical assistance to 12 cities and states with support from key organizations in order to streamline and systematize the use of complex building data. These three-year partnerships – as part of the SEED Collaborative – will be deployed with the support of key allies:\n\n\n\t\tCity of Atlanta, GA\n\n\t\tCity of Berkeley, CA\n\n\t\tCity of Cambridge, MA\n\n\t\tCity of Houston, TX\n\n\t\tCity of Kansas City, MO\n\n\t\tCity of New York, NY\n\n\t\tCity of Orlando, FL\n\n\t\tCity of Philadelphia, PA\n\n\t\tSalt Lake City, UT\n\n\t\tCalifornia Energy Commission\n\n\t\tDistrict of Columbia\n\n\t\tMontgomery County, Maryland\n\n\nMaking It Easier to Identify Ways to Improve Energy Efficiency: 21 organizations from diverse sectors including commercial real estate, global infrastructure, energy services, government, and design and engineering are committed to use DOE’s Asset Score tool to identify opportunities to improve the energy efficiency of a building’s structure and energy-related system and work with DOE on case studies to highlight best practices and lessons learned. Already, Asset Score is being used on 825 commercial and multifamily residential buildings totaling more than 80 million square feet. The following organizations are making a commitment today:\n\n\n\t\tAECOM\n\n\t\tArup\n\n\t\tAssociation of Energy Engineers\n\n\t\tCH2M Hill\n\n\t\tCity of Milwaukee, WI\n\n\t\tDNV GL\n\n\t\tFS Energy\n\n\t\tIngersoll Rand\n\n\t\tJBG Companies\n\n\t\tLiberty Property Trust\n\n\t\tMarriott International\n\n\t\tMarx Okubo\n\n\t\tNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\n\t\tPerformance Systems Development\n\n\t\tSkidmore, Owings & Merrill\n\n\t\tState of Missouri\n\n\t\tState of Rhode Island\n\n\t\tSteven Winter Associates\n\n\t\tTranswestern\n\n\t\tU.S. General Services Administration\n\n\t\tYR&G\n\n\n\tIn addition, organizations have pledged to continue working with cities, utilities, and other stakeholders to continue the progress of the EDA. The Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), and U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) have committed to promote EDA best-practice resources as part of their ongoing work, while the National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) will work with its members to support continued data access solutions.\n\nANNOUNCING NEW COMMITMENTS TO THE PRESIDENT’S CALL TO ACTION\n\n24 Cities, State, and Businesses Commit to Improving the Energy Efficiency of Their Buildings 20 Percent by 2020:  Today, 24 new partners representing 38 million square feet of building space, and 11 plants and facilities, are committing to join the President’s Better Buildings Challenge and improve their energy efficiency 20 percent by 2020. Since its launch in 2011 more than 285 organizations are partnering with the Energy Department to achieve 20 percent portfolio-wide energy savings across a total of 4 billion square feet of building space, and share successful strategies that maximize efficiency over the next decade. To date, partners are sharing 225 of their proven strategies and are on-track to meet their goals, with cumulative energy savings of 94 TBTUs, the equivalent of $840 million dollars. Across the country, these partners have shared energy data for more than 32,000 properties, and are already reporting energy savings of 20 percent or more at 4,500 properties, and 10 percent or more at 12,000 properties. Altogether these new partners will work to improve efficiency across their entire portfolio of buildings.
