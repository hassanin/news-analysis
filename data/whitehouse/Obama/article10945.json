And we will never forget the selfless courage demonstrated by the firefighters, police officers, and first responders who risked their lives to save others.  In the face of unspeakable brutality and evil, these brave men and women demonstrated the enduring strength of our values and the American spirit.  Many who survived did not emerge from the dust and debris unscathed, facing continuing health problems as a result of their service.  The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act would ensure that rescue and recovery workers, residents, students, and others suffering from health consequences related to the World Trade Center disaster have access to the medical monitoring and treatment they need.  It is a critical step for those who continue to bear the physical scars of those attacks.  I applaud the House for its support of this bill and for standing up on behalf of these heroes, who served our country in its time of greatest need.  I look forward to Congress completing consideration of this legislation so I can sign it into law.”\n\n\n\n\n"
