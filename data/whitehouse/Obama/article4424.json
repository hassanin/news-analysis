We will never forget the men and women who lost their lives in the bombing that day.  The passing of time will never extinguish the pain we feel.  But if those murderers hoped to terrorize the American people that day, to break our spirits or shatter the bonds that unite us, then they completely and utterly failed.  We will be forever grateful to the first responders who risked their lives to save others, the law enforcement officers and prosecutors who brought the perpetrators to justice, and the ordinary men and women who set an “Oklahoma standard” for resilience that we still hold today.\nIt is with heavy hearts that Michelle and I send our condolences to the families of those we lost 20 years ago.  And it is with great pride that we send our deepest gratitude to all those who have served as an example of America at its best.\n\n\n\n"
