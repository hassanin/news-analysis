As part of our effort to apply simultaneous pressure against the terrorist group, the President was briefed on the Iraqi-led campaign to liberate Mosul and the advancing efforts of our partners in Northern Syria to isolate Raqqa -- just as the U.S. Military has undertaken a series of strikes to remove key ISIL leaders and attack planners. The President also received an update on the unfolding human tragedy inside Aleppo and the terrible violence carried out by the Asad regime with the backing of Russia and Iran. He directed his team to take all steps, in concert with allies and partners, to deescalate the violence, push for humanitarian access, and for an opportunity for those trapped in the besieged city to be allowed a safe egress, if desired.\n\n\n\n\n"
