For this reason, the national emergency declared on May 16, 2012, to deal with that threat must continue in effect beyond May 16, 2016. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611.\n\n\tThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\n\n\tBARACK OBAMA\n\n\tTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\tMay 12, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n"
