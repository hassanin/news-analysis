The Executive Order directs key Federal agencies to convene a wide range of interested stakeholders, including representatives from industry, state, local, and tribal governments, non-governmental organizations, and the first responder community, to identify and share successes to date and best practices to reduce safety and security risks in the production and storage of potentially harmful chemicals, including through the use of safer alternatives, adoption of best practices, and potential public-private partnerships.\nBackground on Federal Programs for Chemical Facility Safety and Security\n\tFederal agencies implement a number of programs to help prevent chemical facility accidents, reduce risks of terrorist attacks on chemical facilities, protect chemical facility workers, collect and share relevant information with the public and decision makers, and prepare communities and local, tribal, and state first-responders to respond to potential large-scale accidents.  State,  local, and tribal authorities also have critical responsibilities in managing risks from chemical facility accidents through setting and enforcing requirements for zoning, siting, and emergency response and planning.  The primary Federal agencies and programs aimed at addressing chemical safety and security at chemical facilities[1] are summarized below:\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n\n\n\t\tEPA’s Risk Management Program (RMP), established under the Clean Air Act, is aimed at reducing chemical risk at the local level.  EPA’s rules require owners and operators of a facility that manufactures, uses, stores, or otherwise handles certain listed flammable and toxic substances to develop a risk management program that includes hazard assessment (including an evaluation of worst-case and alternative accidental release scenarios), prevention mechanisms, and emergency response measures.  Facilities submit information regarding their risk management program (the information submitted is a \"Risk Management Plan\" or \"RMP\") to EPA.  RMP information helps local fire, police, and emergency response personnel prepare for and respond to chemical accidents, while allowing citizens to understand chemical hazards in their communities.  EPA has focused its chemical plant safety inspection and enforcement efforts on the highest risk facilities. \n\n\t\tEPA also implements the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), which was designed to promote emergency planning and preparedness at the state, local, and tribal levels.  EPCRA helps ensure local communities and first responders have needed information on potential chemical hazards within their communities in order to develop community emergency response plans.  Under EPCRA, facilities with Extremely Hazardous Chemicals must notify the State Emergency Response Commission or Tribal Emergency Response Committees (TERCs) and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), as well as participate in local emergency planning activities. LEPCs and TERCs are then responsible for developing a community emergency response plan. \n\nDepartment of Labor/Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\n\n\n\t\tOSHA’s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard sets requirements for the management of highly hazardous substances to prevent and mitigate the catastrophic releases of flammable, explosive, reactive, and toxic chemicals that may endanger workers.  The PSM standard covers the manufacturing of explosives and processes involving threshold quantities of flammable liquids and flammable gasses, as well as 137 other highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n\t\tIn 2011, OSHA launched its Chemical Plant National Emphasis Program (NEP) to conduct focused inspections at randomly-selected facilities among worksites likely to have highly hazardous chemicals in quantities covered by the PSM standard.  Under this program, OSHA has corrected serious safety issues through approximately 350 inspections and the issuance of 1,325 violations.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS)/National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD)\n\n\n\t\tDHS/NPPD is responsible for implementing Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS), the Federal government’s primary regulatory authority for security of chemicals at stationary facilities.  CFATS is helping make the nation more secure by requiring high-risk chemical facilities to develop and implement security plans that meet eighteen risk-based performance standards established by the Department.  Additionally, since the program’s inception, more than 3,000 facilities have voluntarily removed or reduced the onsite quantity of chemicals of interest to the point that the facilities are no longer considered high-risk.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS)/United States Coast Guard (USCG)\n\n\n\t\tThe U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is responsible for maritime security under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA), 46 U.S.C. § 70101, et seq., which includes authority over certain port facilities that use, store, or transport chemicals or engage in other chemical-related activities.\n\n\t\tMTSA reinforces the national and global importance of security for the marine transportation system, and provides a crucial framework for ensuring the safety of maritime commerce and our domestic ports. MTSA's key requirement is to prevent a maritime transportation security incident (TSI) - defined as any incident that results in a significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruptions to a particular area. Within the maritime venue, preventing TSI's has been a core mission of the Coast Guard since its beginning.\n\nDepartment of Justice/Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (DOJ/ATF)\n\n\n\t\tATF is responsible for enforcing federal explosives laws that govern commerce in explosives in the United States including licensing, storage, record keeping, and conduct of business.  ATF conducts inspections of federal explosives licensees who manufacture, import, sell or store explosives in the United States to ensure explosives are managed in accordance with federal law. In Fiscal Year 2012, ATF conducted 5,390 explosives inspections resulting in approximately 400 reports of violations.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] The Federal government also has a number of regulatory programs related to the safe and secure transportation of chemicals across all modes of transportation, including highway, rail, aviation, maritime, and pipeline.  This fact sheet is focused on chemical safety and security at fixed facilities and does not address the programs focused on the transportation of hazardous materials.  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n"
