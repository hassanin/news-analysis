But the framework\n\tof this package is something I can support, particularly for the\n\tunemployment benefits it extends to the thousands of unemployed workers in\n\tthe State of Connecticut, as well as the extension of the existing middle\n\tclass tax cuts. There is a legitimate role for the House of Representatives\n\tto play in this process - and they should - but at the end of the day, this\n\tshould be passed and signed into law.\"\n\n\tÂ \n\n\n\n\n"
