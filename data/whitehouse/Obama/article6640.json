The Strategy recognized that we faced a world in transition; that we needed to reposition the United States to shape that transition effectively to meet our interests, and that, to be effective, a whole-of-government approach was necessary. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, section 1072, reinforced the importance of whole-of-government integration in this effort. In accordance with section 1072, I provided an implementation plan in September 2012 detailing our work to date to advance the whole-of-government effort.\nI am writing to inform you of my intent to release a new National Security Strategy in early 2014. The new Strategy will update the vision I provided in 2010 and describe my Administration's national security priorities for the remainder of my term. Accordingly, we will submit a broader update on the whole-of-government implementation plan in the spring to reflect this new Strategy.\nSincerely,\nBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
