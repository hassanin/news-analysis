Bold, big-hearted, and Boston strong, Tom was the embodiment of the city he loved and led for more than two decades.  As Boston's longest-serving mayor, Tom helped make his hometown the vibrant, welcoming, world-class place it is today.  His legacy lives on in every neighborhood he helped revitalize, every school he helped turn around, and every community he helped make a safer, better place to live.  I had a chance to speak with Tom’s wife, Angela, yesterday, and today our thoughts and prayers are with her, with the entire Menino family, and with the people of Boston who Tom loved so much, and who loved him in return.   \n\n\n\n\n"
