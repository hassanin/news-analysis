The Council will begin discussing key factors for growth, including:\n\n\nJobs: Improve job training and workforce development in rural America\n\nAgriculture: Expand markets for agriculture, including regional food systems and exports\n\nAccess to Credit: Increase opportunity by expanding access to capital in rural communities and fostering local investment\n\nInnovation: Promote the expansion of biofuels production capacity and community based renewable energy projects\n\nNetworks: Develop high-growth regional economies by capitalizing on inherent regional strengths\n\nHealth Care: Improve access to quality health care through expansion of health technology systems\n\nEducation: Increase post-secondary enrollment rates and completion for rural students\n\nBroadband: Support the President’s plan to increase broadband opportunities in rural America\n\nInfrastructure: Coordinate investment in critical infrastructure\n\nEcosystem markets: Expanding opportunities for conservation, outdoor opportunities  and economic growth on working lands and public lands\n\nSince taking office, President Obama’s Administration has taken significant steps to improve the lives of rural Americans and has provided broad support for rural communities.  The Obama Administration has set goals of modernizing infrastructure by providing broadband access to 10 million Americans, expanding educational opportunities for students in rural areas, and providing affordable health care.  In the long term, these unparalleled rural investments will help ensure that America’s rural communities are repopulating, self-sustaining, and thriving economically.\n\n\n\n\n"
