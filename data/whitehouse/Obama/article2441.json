She expressed deep concern about the Egyptian government's crackdown on independent civil society activity, including continuing legal action against nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Ms. Haines reiterated the Administration's strong support for Egyptian NGOs and other civil society organizations, which are integral both to Egypt's political and economic development and to its long-term stability, and reiterated the Administration's view that the restrictions on the ability of these organizations to operate freely in Egypt should be removed.\n\n\n\n\n"
