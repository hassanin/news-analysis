It should not be held hostage to a deficit-reduction deal.\n\n\t \n\n\tWe also urge the president to  make clear to the American people that the Social Security proposals put forth by the co-chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform fall woefully short of the principles he set forth today for acceptable changes to Social Security.  Their proposals would slash benefits for future generations, increase the retirement age and end Social Security as we know it.  Instead, the president should commit to following the will of the overwhelming majority of the American people who prefer increased revenues to cutting benefits.” \n\n\n\n\n"
