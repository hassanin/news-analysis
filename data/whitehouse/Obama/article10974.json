High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) humanitarian appeal for provision of shelter for those who lost their homes.\n\n\t\t$1 million to the U.N. Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for protection, shelter and resettlement assistance.\n\n\t\t$500,000 to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to support common objectives and priorities among humanitarian actors.\n\n\t\t$732,000 in grants to NGOs to support economic recovery and market systems.\n\n\n\t \n\n\tThe U.S. Department of Defense, through the Manas Transit Center has made payments this year to the Kyrgyz Government of more than $100 million.  The Transit Center conducts its own humanitarian programs, which total $1.7 million this year, which is not included in the assistance totals above.\n\n\n\n\n"
