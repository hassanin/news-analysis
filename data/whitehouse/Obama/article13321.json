Now, as a result of a substantial commitment by the U.S. government, and tough sacrifices from all stakeholders involved, Chrysler has a new lease on life. We said this process would be completed quickly and efficiently, and that’s exactly what has been accomplished today.  Tens of thousands of American jobs will be saved as a result of this extraordinary effort.\"  ###   \n\n\n\n"
