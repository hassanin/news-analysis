The United States and Cuba share certain common interests, among them the health and welfare of the people of Haiti. This engagement provides a unique opportunity to engage with Cuban medical professionals and to discuss opportunities for future cooperation. This cooperation demonstrates how our continued normalization of relations with Cuba can help us advance our interests in the Americas.\n\n\n\n\n"
