I also find it fitting that this year’s World Day Against Child Labor focuses on drawing attention to the particular plight young girls face.  Of the 218 million child laborers worldwide, 100 million are girls – more than half of whom are exposed to hazardous work.  That’s unacceptable, and this world cannot allow it.  We must stand united in opposition to child labor and recommit ourselves to ending this practice in all its forms – today and every day.\n\n\n\n"
