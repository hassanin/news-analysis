Iowa joins a growing number of states – led by both Republican and Democratic governors -- that have chosen to put politics aside in expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to reduce the rate of uninsured and help their states, hospitals, and businesses save on uncompensated care costs. It is another example of how, when both parties are flexible and work together, we can move the country forward for the good of all Americans.\n\n\n\n\n"
