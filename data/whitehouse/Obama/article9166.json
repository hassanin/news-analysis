In this moment of hope, our thoughts go out to the many victims who have suffered due to ETA's actions over many decades. We recognize the courage of the Spanish government and the Spanish people in their enduring efforts to advance democracy and freedom in Spain and around the world. Spain and the United States are close allies in NATO and work together to promote shared values and interests within Europe and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n"
