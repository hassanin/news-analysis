The escalating repression by the Syrian government is outrageous, and the United States strongly condemnsÂ  the continued efforts to suppress peaceful protesters. President Assad and the Syrian government must respect the universal rights of the Syrian people, who are rightly demanding the basic freedoms that they have been denied.\n\n\n\n\n"
