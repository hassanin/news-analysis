    "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary\n\n\nFor Immediate Release\nDecember 19, 2014\n\n \n\n\n\nStatement by the President on Executive Order “Blocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to the Crimea Region of Ukraine”\n\n\n\n\n Today, I issued an Executive Order taking further steps with respect to the situation in Ukraine.  The E.O. prohibits the export of goods, technology, or services to Crimea and prohibits the import of goods, technology, or services from Crimea, as well as new investments in Crimea.  The E.O. also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to impose sanctions on individuals and entities operating in Crimea.  The E.O. is intended to provide clarity to U.S. corporations doing business in the region and reaffirm that the United States will not accept Russia’s occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea.  I again call on Russia to end its occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea, cease its support to separatists in eastern Ukraine, and fulfill its commitments under the Minsk agreements.  My Administration will continue to work closely with allies and partners in Europe and internationally to respond to events in Ukraine and to support Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well its democratic development and reform efforts.  We will continue to review and calibrate our sanctions, in close coordination with our international partners, to respond to Russia's actions.\n\n\n\n\n"
