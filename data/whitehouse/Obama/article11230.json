Ambassador Hill and General Odierno are visiting Washington, D.C. to participate in a July 23 CENTCOM-sponsored conference on planning for the U.S. transition from a military to a civilian lead in Iraq.  The President affirmed his commitment to transform the partnership between the United States and Iraq.  As we reduce the number of U.S. troops in Iraq, we will strengthen cooperation in sectors such as education, rule of law, trade and technology.\n\n\n\n"
