We remain concerned that Mr. Ramzy and several other U.S. journalists have waited months, and in some cases years, for a decision on their press credentials and visa applications.  We have raised our concerns about the treatment of journalists and media organizations repeatedly and at the highest levels with the Chinese government, and will continue to do so.  We have consistently and clearly expressed our expectation to Chinese authorities that China issue and renew visas for journalists working for U.S. media outlets in China.\nOur two countries should be expanding media exchanges to enhance mutual understanding and trust, not restricting the ability of journalists to do their work.  We urge China to commit to timely visa and credentialing decisions for foreign journalists, unblock U.S. media websites, and eliminate other restrictions that impede the ability of journalists to practice their profession.  Around the world, the United States strongly supports universal rights and fundamental freedoms—central among them freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\n\n\n\n\n"
