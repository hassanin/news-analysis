The event builds on the momentum of the ConnectED Initiative, a plan the President announced in 2013, to connect 99% of students to high speed internet and empower teachers with the technology they need to transform teaching and learning. An important part of this initiative is ensuring that digital connectivity supports innovation in America’s classrooms. That is why, this fall, the Administration launched the Future Ready Pledge to help school districts develop a culture where teachers harness the power of technology to personalize learning and provide quality digital content that fosters student inquiry and creativity. Through this pledge, superintendents from across the country are committing to lead a transition in their districts to innovative teaching using technology. Signatories will also work in partnership to share best practices with other school districts.  During the event, President Obama will host a digital pledge signing ceremony with over one hundred superintendents to be joined virtually by hundreds more across the country.\nSince the President’s call to action in support of the ConnectED Initiative, more than $4 billion in public and private funding has been committed toward expanding high-speed Internet connectivity for America's schools and libraries. Additional details about the conference will be released at a later date.\n\n\n\n\n"
