Child and Family Services Agency.\n\n\tThe White House is also encouraging other employers, including federal agencies, to expand their events by opening their doors to local youth participants, including foster youth, youth with disabilities, and children who may not have a parent with a job that allows them to bring their children to work.  This is a joint effort between the White House Council on Women and Girls and My Brother's Keeper Initiative to provide additional work-based learning opportunities to young people across the country.\n\n\tFor more information about this effort, visit www.wh.gov/daughtersandsons.\n\n\n\n\n"
