We regret the loss of life that has occurred, and we offer our condolences to the families and friends of those who have been lost.\nWe and others in the international community stand together in calling for free, fair, transparent, and peaceful elections in Senegal.  The Senegalese people have come to deserve – and expect – nothing less.\n\n\n\n\n"
