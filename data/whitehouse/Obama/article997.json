The Federal Government has mobilized to respond to this major disaster, and many Federal employees are dealing with overwhelming personal losses.\nTo further assist Federal employees and their family members adversely affected by the storms and tornadoes in Oklahoma, I hereby direct the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish an emergency leave transfer program, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 6391. The program will permit employees in the executive and judicial branches, or an agency leave bank established under 5 U.S.C. 6363, to donate unused annual leave for transfer to employees of the same or other agencies (or the judicial branch) who were adversely affected by the storms and tornadoes in Oklahoma and who need additional time off for recovery. I further direct OPM to provide additional guidance to agencies on the program's administration.\nBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
