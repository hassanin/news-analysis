The President thanked Kelly for his service, for sharing his journey with people across the globe through social media, for his participation in important research about what it will take for us to make long journeys in space, and for inspiring a new generation of young people to pursue studies and careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. He also noted that Kelly’s year in space would provide critical data to researchers trying to understand how to keep astronauts healthy during long space voyages and fulfill the President’s vision of putting American astronauts on Mars in the 2030s. Thanks to Kelly’s work, in addition to that of everyone at NASA and in the U.S. space industry, the President believes the United States will be successful in that journey to Mars and will continue to lead and inspire the world in space exploration. \n\nA photo of the President making the call can be found HERE.\n\n\n\n\n"
