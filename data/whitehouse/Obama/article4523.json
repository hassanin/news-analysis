Our men and women in uniform and their families deserve nothing less, and I thank the Commission for its work.\nMy Administration fully supports the underlying objectives of each of the Commission's 15 recommendations. Upon receipt of these recommendations, I directed my team to consider these recommendations and to work with the Commission to adopt or refine the specific proposals in as many instances as possible. Given the complexity of military compensation and retirement programs and our solemn responsibility to ensure that any changes further the objectives above, I will report to the Congress by April 30, 2015, on the initial results of this work and with proposals that I recommend be enacted without delay; subsequent analysis may be needed for some of the recommendations.\nBARACK OBAMA\n\n\n\n\n"
