On ISIL, the President thanked President Hollande for France’s significant contribution to the coalition’s efforts to strike ISIL targets in Iraq and to provide training to the Iraqi Security Forces. The two leaders discussed ongoing efforts to counter ISIL forces in the region and the need for coalition partners to take action to counter the threat from ISIL.\n\n\n\n\n"
