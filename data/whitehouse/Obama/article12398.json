I believe the nation will miss his wisdom, wit and compassion.  I count myself lucky because I know he’s not going too far and will always be source of advice and counsel.  Jill and I wish Chris and Jackie the best as they move on to their next endeavors and know the future holds only great things for their family.”\n\n\n\n"
