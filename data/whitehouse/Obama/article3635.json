As Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rubén strengthened Latino communities in his district and across the country, and fought to fix our broken immigration system. During his 10 terms in Congress, he has helped lead the fight to protect our most vulnerable families, make higher education more affordable, and expand job-training programs for every American willing to work hard. I'm grateful for Rubén's tireless efforts, and I look forward to continuing to work with him throughout the remainder of his term. Michelle and I wish Rubén and his family well in whatever the future may hold.\n\n\n\n\n"
