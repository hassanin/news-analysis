We send our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the victims and wishes for a speedy recovery for those who were injured. This heinous attack targeting Christian worshipers as they gathered to practice their faith demonstrates once again the need for the international community to remain resolute in confronting acts of terrorism across the globe.
