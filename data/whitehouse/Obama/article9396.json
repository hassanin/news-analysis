Levin’s Statement on President Obama’s Address to Congress on Jobs\n\n\tWASHINGTON – Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., issued the following statement tonight following President Obama’s address to a joint session of Congress.\n\n\t“The country heard tonight a rousing, patriotic call from the president to bipartisan action. The jobs program that the president outlined tonight with such urgency will accelerate economic recovery. The elements of this program have had bipartisan support in the past and would not add to the budget deficit. There is overwhelming agreement among economists that the Recovery Act we passed in 2009 helped to prevent a second Great Depression; now we must act to avoid slipping back into recession. The people of Michigan and the nation need Congress to work together to create jobs. I hope our Republican colleagues will join us in doing so.”\n\n\n\n\n"
