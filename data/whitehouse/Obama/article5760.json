Under the leadership of Governor Patrick, Massachusetts joins a growing coalition of states, cities and counties that are doing part to make sure no American working full-time has to support a family in poverty.\nI look forward to Governor Patrick signing this bill into law soon, and I urge Congress to follow Massachusetts’ lead and lift wages for 28 million Americans by raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10.\n\n\n\n\n"
