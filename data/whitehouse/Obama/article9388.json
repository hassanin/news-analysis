The 26 members of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness are pleased that the President embraced several Council recommendations, including programs cutting red tape, improving our nation's infrastructure, helping U.S. universities graduate more engineers and skills training programs for advanced manufacturing and healthcare.\n\n\tThe Council is focused on many other actions to increase jobs and competitiveness. They include both private-sector actions and government-led initiatives.\n\n\tBecause more than two million construction workers are out of work, the Council identified ten high-priority infrastructure projects based on their potential to put Americans to work right away -- projects that have already been funded, but are being held up by regulations. We are working with the Administration to fast-track permitting and get these projects moving. There is broad support within the Council and the business and labor communities for investing in our nation's aviation, broadband, surface and energy systems, including improving existing financing mechanisms for our critical infrastructure needs.\n\n\tThe Council has held \"Listening & Action\" sessions with small businesses, start-ups, and entrepreneurs across the country to identify steps that both the public and private sectors can take to create jobs and strengthen the economy. We heard from small businesses that they face too much red tape. At the Council's urging, the Administration has started a regulatory look-back, directing every agency including independent agencies, to determine how they can make their regulations more friendly to small business and more streamlined.\n\n\tThe Jobs Council will be making additional recommendations to the President over the next few weeks on topics such as tax policy and investment in the U.S. economy.\n\n\tPresident Obama and congressional leaders are correctly focusing national attention on job creation. We need a sense of urgency and more collaboration around getting more Americans back to work and maintaining America's competitive leadership.\n\n\n\n\n"
