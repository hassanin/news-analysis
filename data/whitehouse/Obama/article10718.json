and committed to meet future needs for trainers, mentors, and critical enablers.   \n\n\t\tSigned a new NATO-Afghanistan partnership declaration, underscoring NATO’s enduring, long-term commitment to help Afghanistan enhance and sustain its security forces, including through the Afghan National Army Trust Fund, so that Afghanistan does not once again become a safe haven for violent extremists.   \n\n\nDeepening NATO-Russia Cooperation\n\n\tNATO leaders met with Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev in a Summit meeting of the NATO-Russia Council, in recognition of the importance both NATO and Russia attribute to this partnership and to their ability to achieve concrete progress toward shared goals.  In this meeting, participants:\n\t \n\n\n\t\tApproved the Joint Review of 21st Century Common Security Challenges that will guide NATO-Russia security cooperation.\n\n\t\tAgreed to cooperate on missile defense against shared threats.  The NATO-Russia Council will resume theater ballistic missile defense exercises and leaders tasked it to identify opportunities for Russia to cooperate with NATO’s new territorial missile defense capability by June 2011.\n\n\t\tAgreed to expand cooperation in support of the Afghan government, including by expanding ISAF-Russia transit arrangements; expanding joint training of counternarcotics officers from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asian nations; and setting up a trust fund for Afghan helicopter maintenance.\n\n\t\tCommitted to make better use of the NATO-Russia Council to manage crises and enhance reciprocal transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
