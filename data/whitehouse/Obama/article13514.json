With this hard fought win, Scott has shown he is willing to fight the tough battles on behalf of the people in his district.   As a candidate, Scott courageously championed the economic plans we need to lift our nation and put it on a better path, and he will continue to do so in Congress.  With his proven record of creating high paying jobs and standing up for Upstate New York, Scott will bring to the nation’s capitol the change New Yorkers need.     \n\n\n\n"
