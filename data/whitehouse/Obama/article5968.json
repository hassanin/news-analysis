Fox\n\n\n\n\nAs Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense Christine H. Fox concludes her tenure at the Department of Defense, I want to acknowledge her dedicated service to our nation and to the men and women of our Armed Forces.  Last year, she graciously agreed to return to the Department of Defense shortly after she had officially retired in order to ensure that Secretary Hagel and I had the support we needed in a challenging time.  She provided steady leadership in the wake of sequester and developed an approach to the budget that puts our military on a path toward restored readiness.  I am grateful to Christine for her willingness to step in and serve her nation once again -- as the highest ranking woman ever to serve at the Department of Defense -- and wish her the very best in her future endeavors.\n\n\n\n\n"
