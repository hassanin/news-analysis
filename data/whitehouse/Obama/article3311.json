    "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary\n\n\nFor Immediate Release\nFebruary 09, 2016\n\n \n\n\n\nPress Secretary Josh Earnest on the Supreme Court's Decision to Stay the Clean Power Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWe disagree with the Supreme Court's decision to stay the Clean Power Plan while litigation proceeds.  The Clean Power Plan is based on a strong legal and technical foundation, gives States the time and flexibility they need to develop tailored, cost-effective plans to reduce their emissions, and will deliver better air quality, improved public health, clean energy investment and jobs across the country, and major progress in our efforts to confront the risks posed by climate change. We remain confident that we will prevail on the merits. Even while the litigation proceeds, EPA has indicated it will work with states that choose to continue plan development and will prepare the tools those states will need.  At the same time, the Administration will continue to take aggressive steps to make forward progress to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n\n\n\n"
