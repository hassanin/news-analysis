The Vice President relayed that the United States had sent a message to Russia that the world is watching and underscored the need to deescalate the situation.  He also urged Ukraine to show restraint.  The leaders also reviewed recent progress towards fulfilling IMF conditions for disbursing ‎the next tranche of financial assistance, and agreed on the importance of recent Ukrainian efforts to continue critical anti-corruption reforms.\n\n\n\n\n"
