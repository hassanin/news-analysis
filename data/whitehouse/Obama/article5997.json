Prime Minister Straujuma thanked the United States for its tangible commitments to Latvia’s security, including the augmentation of NATO’s Baltic Air Policing mission and the deployment of paratroopers from the U.S. Army Europe's 173rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team to conduct exercises in Latvia. The two leaders discussed the situation in Ukraine and agreed on the need for the United States and Europe to remain united in confronting Russia’s destabilizing actions in eastern Ukraine and its illegal occupation of Crimea.
