But further steps are urgently needed to ensure that we leave our children a planet thatâ€™s not polluted or damaged.\nThe White House today released a new report from the Council of Economic Advisers that examines the economic consequences of delaying action to stem climate change. The report finds that delaying policy actions by a decade increases total mitigation costs by approximately 40 percent, and failing to take any action would risk substantial economic damage. These findings emphasize the need for policy action today.\n\n\n\n\n"
