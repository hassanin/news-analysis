We extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims of this attack and fully support efforts to bring  those responsible to justice. The United States and our international partners remain committed to the people and Government of Afghanistan as we work together to build a more stable and prosperous peaceful Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n"
