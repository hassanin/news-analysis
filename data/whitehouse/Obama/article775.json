and \n\n\nthat the agency should remind employees on a periodic basis of the workplace flexibilities available to them.\n\n\n(c)  The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) shall issue guidance to Chief Human Capital Officers regarding the requirements set forth in this section within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, and shall assist agencies with implementation of this section.\n(d)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the discretion granted to an employee's supervisor in making a decision on the request for work schedule flexibilities, in accordance with the agency's mission-related requirements.\n Sec. 2.  Expanding Access to Workplace Flexibilities.\nAgency heads shall ensure that the following workplace flexibilities are available to the maximum extent practicable, in accordance with the laws and regulations governing these programs and consistent with mission needs:\n(a)  part-time employment and job sharing, including for temporary periods of time where appropriate; \n(b)  alternative work schedules, including assurance that core hours are limited only to those hours that are necessary; \n(c)  break times for nursing mothers and a private space to express milk;  \n(d)  telework; \n(e)  annual leave and sick leave, including the advancement of leave for employee and family care situations; \n(f)   sick leave for family care and bereavement;  \n(g)  sick leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition; \n(h)  sick leave for adoption; \n(i)   leave pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), including allowing employees to take their FMLA leave intermittently as allowed under the Act, including for childbirth, adoption, and foster care;\n(j)  leave transfer programs, including leave banks; \n(k)  bone marrow and organ donor leave;
