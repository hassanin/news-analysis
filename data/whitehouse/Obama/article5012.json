The Holodomor, or “death by hunger,” remains one of the gravest atrocities of the last century and is a singularly tragic chapter in Ukrainian history.\nWhile the suffering of the Holodomor was immeasurable, this man-made famine failed to extinguish the unconquerable spirit of the Ukrainian people. As we commemorate this horrific tragedy, we also pay tribute to the enduring strength, courage, and spirit of the people of Ukraine – qualities that Ukrainians continue to draw upon today as, in the face of great adversity, they seek to build a more prosperous, secure, and democratic state.\nAs we unite in remembrance of the millions of innocent victims of the Holodomor, we also reaffirm our shared commitment to Ukraine’s bright future, and to promoting respect for the universal human rights and fundamental freedoms that are the birthright of all humankind.\n\n\n\n\n"
