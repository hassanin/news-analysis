We need jobs now, and this bill will lead to immediate jobs for construction workers, teachers, veterans, first responders, young people and the long-term unemployed.\n\n\tWe call on everyone in Congress to put creating jobs and jump-starting our economy above any partisan politics. We call on Congress to put creating good jobs above more tax cuts for the wealthy. It's time for those who constantly call for tax cuts to support Obama's plan to provide tax cuts to those who need them the most: working families.\n\n\tWe are sending a strong message to Congress in support of Obama's American Jobs Act. We demand that they support Obama's plan to put millions of people to work repairing America's infrastructure not only to help unemployed working families and their employers create the jobs they need, but also to reduce our nation's deficit.\n\n\tWe ask all workers to join the UAW members and their families in telling Congress that creating good jobs is a higher priority than cutting government spending by adding their names to our online petition or visit uaw.org for the link.\n\n\tWe'll deliver our petition to members of Congress and demand a sustainable good jobs creation program NOW!\"Â \n\n\n\n\n"
