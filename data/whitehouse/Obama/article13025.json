His rich baritone reached millions of living rooms every night, and in an industry of icons, Walter set the standard by which all others have been judged.   He was there through wars and riots, marches and milestones, calmly telling us what we needed to know. And through it all, he never lost the integrity he gained growing up in the heartland. But Walter was always more than just an anchor. He was someone we could trust to guide us through the most important issues of the day; a voice of certainty in an uncertain world. He was family.  He invited us to believe in him, and he never let us down. This country has lost an icon and a dear friend, and he will be truly missed.   ## \n\n\n\n"
