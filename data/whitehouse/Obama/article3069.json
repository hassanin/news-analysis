With these actions, California is expanding its promise to workers that they shouldn't have to lose a paycheck if they get sick and has ensured that workers will no longer be earning a wage that keeps too many families in poverty. Since I first called on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage in 2013, 18 states and the District of Columbia have acted on their own to raise the minimum wage.  States and cities are making progress in expanding paid leave.  Now it's time for Congress to step up and do what is right for every hard-working American and for our economy.\n\n\n\n\n"
