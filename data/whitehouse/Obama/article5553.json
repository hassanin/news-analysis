The Prime Minister and the Vice President discussed the reconstruction needs in eastern Ukraine, and the Vice President shared U.S. plans to provide almost $7 million in assistance to respond to immediate needs in the newly liberated areas in the east, which includes $1 million in new support. This includes contributions to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UNHCR to support efforts to restore access to potable water and provide medical treatment, as well as funding to support small infrastructure and rebuilding projects in these communities. \n\n\n\n\n"
