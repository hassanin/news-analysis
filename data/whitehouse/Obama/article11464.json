Solis will travel to Michigan on Thursday, June 17.  She will be joined by Executive Director of the White House Council on Automotive Communities and Workers Dr. Ed Montgomery.  During the visit, the secretary and Montgomery will tour Macomb Community College’s engineering and advanced technology training programs.  The secretary also will make an important announcement related to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the creation of jobs across the state of Michigan.\nGeneral Services Administration\nAdministrator of General Services Martha Johnson will join Pennsylvanian workers at the construction site of the new energy-efficient solar roof of the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Regional Office & Insurance Center to highlight GSA's 218 active federal building construction projects across the nation.  This summer, GSA Recovery Act construction projects are quadrupling and workers across the country are installing solar power arrays at dozens of Federal buildings nationwide, dramatically increasing GSA’s solar power generation and reducing the federal government’s consumption of energy.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development\nDeputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ron Sims will travel to Baltimore, MD, to visit Wayland Village Senior Housing, an affordable housing project that is currently under construction with HUD Recovery Act funds.  He will discuss this transformative project that is creating jobs and stimulating the local economy.  As summer heats up, Recovery Act-funded construction projects are kicking into high gear and putting HUD's dollar investment and American people to work.  By the end of this summer, HUD will have rehabilitated 230,000 housing units.\nFriday, June 18th\nDepartment of Agriculture\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack will visit Annapolis, MD and highlight how American Recovery and Reinvestment Act investments in Maryland and throughout the country are allowing people in thousands of rural communities to access clean and safe water.  Through the Recovery Act, USDA Rural Development received $3.6 billion in funding, which is helping to rebuild and revitalize drinking water, sanitary sewer, solid waste and storm drainage systems throughout rural America.\nDepartment of Energy\nAssistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Cathy Zoi will travel to Manchester, NH to visit a newly weatherized home with U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen where they will highlight the progress the Administration’s weatherization program has made over the last year.  This summer, the Administration expects to weatherize 82,000 homes – 27 times as many homes as were weatherized last summer.  Home weatherization saves consumers on average $400 per year in utility costs.\n\n\n\n"
