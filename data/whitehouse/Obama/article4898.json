District Court Ruling Dismissing Immigration Lawsuit\n\n\n\n\nJudge Howell’s decision today confirms what the Department of Justice and scholars throughout the country have been saying all along: the President’s executive actions on immigration are lawful.  The Supreme Court and Congress have made clear that federal officials can set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws, and the actions announced by the President are consistent with those taken by administrations of both parties for the last half century.  The court correctly dismissed Sheriff Arpaio’s lawsuit.\n\n\n\n\n"
