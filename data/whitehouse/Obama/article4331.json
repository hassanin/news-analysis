We are profoundly grateful for the efforts of the first responders and others who continue to assist those in need.\nThe victims could have been any one of our parents, children, or someone from one of our communities. Amtrak is like a second family to me, as it is for so many other passengers. For my entire career, I’ve made the trip from Wilmington to Washington and back. I've come to know the conductors, engineers, and other regulars—men and women riding home to kiss their kids goodnight—as we passed the flickering lights of each neighborhood along the way.\nOur thoughts are with every person who is grieving right now from this terrible tragedy. As a nation, we pray for the victims and their families.\n\n\n\n\n"
