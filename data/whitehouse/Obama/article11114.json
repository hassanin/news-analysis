That’s the opportunity an education can provide,” President Obama <\nhttp://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/video/President-Obamas-Message-for-Americas-Students\n>  said to students last year <\nhttp://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/mediaresources/PreparedSchoolRemarks\n> .  \n\n\nPresident Obama’s Back-to-School Speech will be live streamed on\nWhiteHouse.gov\n.
