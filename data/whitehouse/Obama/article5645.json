The President will continue to urge Congress to act to avoid a lapse in funding of the Highway Trust Fund, which will go insolvent as early as August – putting numerous active projects at risk. This week Congress will consider a solution to avoid that scenario.\nIn addition to today’s report, the White House released an interactive transportation map detailing the condition of and consequences for each state’s roads and bridges as well as the jobs that would be put at risk, if Congress fails to act.\nThe report can be found HERE, and the map can be found HERE.\n\n\n\n\n"
