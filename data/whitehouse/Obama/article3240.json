    "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary\n\n\n\nMarch 02, 2016\n\n \n\n\n\nStatement by the President on United Nations Security Council Resolution 2270\n\n\n\n\n\n\tToday, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted UNSCR 2270, which imposes significant costs on the DPRK in response to its January 6 nuclear test and February 7 missile launch. This resolution levies strong new sanctions aimed at halting Pyongyang's efforts to advance its weapons of mass destruction programs. I have consistently said that the DPRK would face consequences for its actions, and I welcome this resolution as a firm, united, and appropriate response by the international community to the DPRK's recent provocations that flagrantly violated multiple Security Council resolutions. Today, the international community, speaking with one voice, has sent Pyongyang a simple message: North Korea must abandon these dangerous programs and choose a better path for its people.Â \n\n\n\n\n"
