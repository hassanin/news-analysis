The proposal will also provide the government with essential tools to respond in a financial crisis, so that we can wind down and liquidate a large, interconnected failing financial firm.  It allows us to protect the economy and taxpayers so that we can end the belief that any firm is \"Too Big to Fail\".\nAs the bill moves forward, I will take every opportunity to work with Chairman Dodd and his colleagues to strengthen the bill and will fight against efforts to weaken it.\nAmerican families deserve a strong, independent consumer financial protection agency that is accountable for setting and enforcing clear rules across the financial marketplace.  And I will not accept attempts to undermine the independence of the consumer protection agency, or to exclude from its purview banks, credit card companies or nonbank firms such as debt collectors, credit bureaus, payday lenders or auto dealers.\nI will oppose any loopholes that could harm consumers or investors, or that allow institutions to avoid oversight that is important to financial stability.\nWe need to ensure the ultimate bill provides strong, clear authority for setting and enforcing rules, limiting excessive risk taking in the financial system, and winding down the largest financial firms when necessary in a way that does not cause a financial panic.  All derivatives must be regulated and shareholders should have a say not just on pay but also other compensation that rewards risk taking.  We will stand firm against any attempt by the financial sector to avoid their responsibilities: in any future crisis the big financial companies must pay, not taxpayers.\n\n\n\n"
