The conversation was a continuation of the dialogue the President began in February when he met with a group of western governors to discuss the complex challenges presented by an increasingly dry future for the West. Due to the drought affecting the western part of the country, the wildfire season in some parts of the West has begun earlier and is expected to last longer than usual. The President expressed his commitment to working closely with the governors as they deal with fires and their devastating impacts. He also reiterated the Administration’s commitment to fund wildfire suppression in a more responsible and effective way, a commitment that was included in his Fiscal Year 2015 budget request.\nThe President and his advisors discussed the outlook for the existing drought and the current fire season, as well as for long-term wildfire trends. They also highlighted progress in providing the best-available science to aid in preparedness and response operations, modernizing wildland firefighting resources like airtankers, and efforts to build resilience to fires by restoring landscapes and forests. The President stated that the Federal Government will continue to look for ways to effectively partner with state and local governments, and that he looked forward to continuing to engage with the governors as they prepare their states for the impacts of a changing climate.\nThe following governors participated in the meeting:\n\n\n\t\tGovernor Brewer of Arizona\n\n\t\tGovernor Bullock of Montana\n\n\t\tGovernor Dalrymple of North Dakota\n\n\t\tGovernor Daugaard of South Dakota\n\n\t\tGovernor Herbert of Utah\n\n\t\tGovernor Hickenlooper of Colorado\n\n\t\tGovernor Mead of Wyoming\n\n\t\tGovernor Otter of Idaho\n\nThe following Administration Officials participated in the meeting:\n\n\n\t\tSecretary Vilsack, U.S. Department of Agriculture\n\n\t\tSecretary Jewell, U.S. Department of the Interior\n\n\t\tKathryn Sullivan, Acting Administrator of NOAA\n\n\t\tRobert Bonnie, Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\n\n\t\tRhea Suh, Assistant Secretary of Policy, Management and Budget, U.S. Department of the Interior\n\n\t\tDr. John Holdren, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology\n\n\t\tMichael Boots, Acting Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality\n\n\t\tJohn Podesta, Counselor to the President\n\n\t\tDavid Agnew, Director of Intergovernmental Affairs\n\n\t\tBrian Deese, Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget\n\n\t\tLisa Monaco, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism\n\n\t\tTodd Rosenblum, Assistant Secretary for Homeland Defense and America’s Security Affairs, U.S. Department of Defense\n\n\t\tCraig Fugate, Administrator of FEMA\n\n\t\tTom Tidwell, Chief, U.S. Forest Service\n\n\t\tLouis Uccellini, Assistant Administrator for Weather Services and National Weather Service Director, NOAA\n\n\t\tBob Perciasepe, Deputy Administrator, Environmental Protection Agencyn\n\n\n\n\n\n"
