    "content": "MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIESThe President has rescinded the direction to the Secretary of Homeland Security (the Secretary) to lead the coordination of ongoing efforts across the Federal Government to resettle vulnerable Afghans, including those who worked on behalf of the United States, pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 (Management of Domestic Incidents), and as further complemented by Presidential Policy Directive-44 (Enhancing Domestic Incident Response).  The President has further rescinded the direction to the Secretary to establish a Unified Coordination Group to facilitate increased Federal response capacity and interagency coordination.    The Secretary has led an interagency effort to process, receive, care for, and resettle to their new communities approximately 90,000 Afghan arrivals — and led a whole-of-society effort to welcome them.  The last Afghan parolee at our final domestic processing facility departed in September 2022 for their new community.  With the transition to Enduring Welcome — the U.S. Government’s multi-year commitment to support our Afghan allies — the United States will use established roles and responsibilities as we continue to welcome new arrivals who will enter with a durable immigration status and directly travel to their new communities.  Therefore, there is no longer a need for the Unified Coordination Group and the increased domestic Federal response capacity.Nothing in this memorandum abrogates, alters, or impedes the ability of Federal departments and agencies or Federal officials to perform their responsibilities under law.JAKE SULLIVAN"
