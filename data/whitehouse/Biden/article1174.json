Demonstrate Leadership.Today, the President reaffirmed his commitment to leading an international and coordinated vaccination effort, announcing that the U.S. will donate 80 million U.S. vaccines – the 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines previously announced and at least an additional 20 million doses of U.S. authorized vaccines by the end of June. The U.S. will continue to donate from our excess supply as that supply is delivered to us. Today’s announcement is the Administration’s next step as we ramp up our efforts to respond to COVID-19 around the world. Going forward over the coming weeks, the U.S. will use its leadership working with our G7 partners, the EU, COVAX, and others to coordinate a multilateral effort focused on ending the pandemic. Specifically, we seek to garner concrete, deliverable commitments from other governments and private sector partners to make available more vaccines, spur production and manufacturing for vaccines and raw materials, get shots into arms around the world, and provide health security assistance to save lives, stop the spread of COVID-19, reduce the lifespan of this pandemic, and recover economically.In service of ending the pandemic everywhereSharing U.S. surplus vaccine doses to save livesThis decision builds on existing U.S. leadership in the global COVID response###"
