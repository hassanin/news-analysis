To that end, the United States is making a $10 billion commitment to end hunger and invest in food systems at home and abroad.”–  President Biden, UN General Assembly Address September 21, 2021The United States is committed to developing innovative, inclusive, science-based, and creative solutions to food systems transformation.  It is committed to leveraging the power of well-functioning markets at the local and international levels to bolster food security and sustainable food systems by expanding income opportunities, stabilizing food supply and prices, reducing food loss and waste, and improving dietary diversity and nutrition.Building sustainable food systems requires work in all three dimensions of sustainable development – social, economic, and environmental.  More efficient food systems are critical for alleviating poverty, meeting the world’s food needs, and shrinking agriculture’s environmental impact.  Helping all the components of food systems adapt to a warming planet and reduce global emissions through climate-smart agricultural practices is also critical to ensure long-term food and nutritional security. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack and USAID Administrator Samantha Power joined UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and global partners in the September 23 UN Food Systems Summit to spur urgent action to end hunger and malnutrition and build more sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems at home and abroad.  Demonstrating the U.S. commitment to accelerating progress toward these goals, the United States announced a planned multi-year investment of more than $10 billion to promote food systems transformation through innovation and climate-smart agriculture, improved infrastructure for food access and inclusive market opportunities, programs prioritizing women’s and children’s needs, improving nutrition, reducing food loss and waste, and climate change mitigation and adaptation within our own country and worldwide. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to advance these critical initiatives.Domestically, we are setting pathways forward for meeting these challenges, including with historic investments to build back better in the face of the climate crisis and economic disruptions from COVID-19.  Out of our total $10 billion commitment, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack announced we intend to invest $5 billion to strengthen food systems in the United States, including through investments in systems and infrastructure to ensure access to healthy diets for all Americans, and investments in fair and efficient markets to improve the inclusivity and resilience of our food systems.  Other domestic investments support the expansion of climate smart agriculture and forestry.The United States is committed to not only addressing these challenges domestically but also globally, in partnership with governments, local actors, and the private sector.  Working with Congress, and building on a long history as the largest provider of international agriculture, economic development, and nutrition assistance as well as humanitarian assistance, USAID Administrator and Feed the Future Coordinator Samantha Power announced a $5 billion commitment over five years to Feed the Future, the U.S. government’s global hunger and food security initiative, and an expansion of Feed the Future target countries.  Launched in 2010 to reduce poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, Feed the Future supports countries’ pathways to food system transformation, drawing on U.S. expertise and experience in innovation, technology, and research and development. International programs under the Feed the Future initiative and other domestic initiatives that support the UN Food Systems Summit goals include: ###"
