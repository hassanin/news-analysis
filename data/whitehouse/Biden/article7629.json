    "content": "President Biden: “During National Ocean Month, we celebrate the beauty and bounty of our ocean and reaffirm our commitment to protecting and conserving our marine environments for a sustainable future.”Following President Biden’s proclamation of June to be National Ocean Month, and in recognition of June 8 as World Ocean Day, the White House today announced a series of new steps the Administration is taking to conserve and restore the health and productivity of the ocean for the benefit of all Americans.Today’s actions include initiating the designation process for a new national marine sanctuary to conserve Hudson Canyon in the Atlantic Ocean, a phase out of single-use plastics in national parks and public lands, and the launch of efforts to create America’s first-ever Ocean Climate Action Plan and to center environmental justice in ocean science and technology activities and investments.Over the course of June, Federal agencies will be making additional announcements that showcase the scale and pace of the Biden-Harris Administration’s ocean agenda, including through the President’s America the Beautiful conservation initiative, unprecedented investments in coastal resilience and restoration through the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the rapid deployment and construction of offshore wind farms, U.S. engagement with the international Ocean Panel to spur sustainable ocean economic development, and the use of science to guide ocean planning and management.The specific steps that the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing today in recognition of World Ocean Day are:The Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing work to harness the clean energy potential of the ocean, conserve and restore its health and productivity, and lead the world toward sustainable ocean policies is informed and motivated by an understanding that a healthy ocean is indispensable to our economy, our health, and to our climate.A report issued last week by scientists at NOAA and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, for example, found that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are now more than 50% higher than pre-industrial levels. The effects of climate change on weather systems are widely known, but these rising levels of greenhouse gas pollution are also deeply disruptive to ocean systems, leading to increasing sea surface temperatures, rising sea levels, and an increased absorption of carbon, which makes sea water more acidic, leads to ocean deoxygenation, and makes it more difficult for some marine organisms to survive.In addition, tomorrow, NOAA and the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release the latest update to the Marine Economy Satellite Account (MESA), a report that provides statistics on some of the contributions to the U.S. economy from the nation’s oceans, seaports, Great Lakes, and other major water bodies (e.g., Puget Sound, Chesapeake Bay). Many of the activities covered by the MESA, including commercial fishing, coastal tourism, and recreation, rely on the ecological health of the marine environment. The U.S. Natural Capital Accounts, announced on Earth Day, will align with the MESA to make these dependencies explicit, expand the accounts to include other economic values; and enable further development of a sustainable ocean economy. This year’s report will show the impact to the marine economy caused by the coronavirus pandemic in terms of employment, sales, and GDP contribution. The report identifies industries and activities most affected by the 2020 downturn, but also areas of growth and innovation in several marine sectors. ###"
