In turn, this team has partnered with faith and community leaders across the nation and around the world.Our country has made great progress thanks to neighborhood partnerships and compassionate leaders of all faiths and beliefs, whether it was hosting vaccination clinics, preventing evictions, helping to ensure that children get back to school and workers get jobs, or countless other acts of service. The Biden-Harris Administration is also working tirelessly to advance policies promoting religious equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility and protecting the fundamental right to practice faith without fear, especially in light of the troubling rise of antisemitic, xenophobic, and bigoted attacks against people of faith—targeting synagogues, predominantly Black churches, and Muslim and Sikh communities, among other communities. In addition, the Administration has prioritized the cultivation of a spirit of welcome for people of all religious, political, and ideological stripes; a commitment to treating everyone with equal respect and dignity; and the hard but essential work of building bridges across differences in background and beliefs.Administration achievements that advance these partnerships and policies include:Addressing the COVID-19 Pandemic and Boosting Economic RecoveryIncreasing Opportunity and Mobility for Historically Disadvantaged Communities and Combatting Systematic RacismStrengthening Pluralism and Protecting the Right to Practice Faith Without FearAdvancing Global Development and Humanitarian WorkWorking with Faith and Community Groups to Protect Our Environment###"
