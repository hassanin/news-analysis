Their labor — in hospitals and laboratories, on farms and in factories, in stores and in homes — has long been critical to keeping our nation running, and the past year has made these contributions all the more visible. Women represent half of all workers, yet they are over 60 percent of our essential workers. Women of color are disproportionately represented in frontline jobs and comprise more than half of the workers in critical service fields such as housekeeping, personal care services, and nursing assistance.Our country’s caregiving crisis has compounded the effects of the economic downturn; women have borne the brunt of increased caregiving demands, contending with closed schools and child care centers and caring for sick family members. And these challenges have been particularly acute for essential workers and low-wage workers. The impact is striking; over 2 million women have dropped out of the labor force since February 2020. Nearly one year after the pandemic began, the women’s labor force participation rate reached its lowest point in more than 30 years.The American Rescue Plan (ARP) meets the moment – and provides immediate relief for many Americans, including women of color, who so often are the first fired and the last hired when a crisis hits. Just as women of color were finally starting to see wage gains from the 2009 recession, a new crisis threatened to erase that progress. This is why President Biden made passing the American Rescue Plan his top priority.Thanks to the hard work of advocates, Congress, and the Biden-Harris Administration, the American Rescue Plan is now law, delivering much-needed support to women, families, and communities.Several aspects of this relief are particularly critical to support women of color as we build a more equitable economy. Here are a few to highlight:This pandemic has exacerbated and shone a light on many issues—among them the enormous economic barriers facing so many women, particularly women of color, and the consequences of those barriers for them and for our economy. The passage of the American Rescue Plan will bring relief to so many women who have borne the brunt of the pandemic – and it will be the first step in creating an economic recovery that removes barriers for women of color, and gives every American a fair shot. Joelle Gamble is the Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.Shilpa Phadke is the Special Assistant to the President for Gender Policy."
