    "content": "President Biden announces new domestic steps to continue building supply chain resiliencePresident Biden has made resilient supply chains a top priority of his Administration since Day One. Today, the President is holding a Summit on Global Supply Chain Resilience with the European Union and 14 like-minded countries to foster greater international cooperation on near-term supply chain disruptions and chart a course to strengthen and diversify the entire supply chain ecosystem over the long term—from raw materials, intermediate and finished goods, manufacturing, to shipping, logistics, warehousing, and distribution. The President’s Summit builds on recent Biden-Harris Administration actions including the expansion of port operating hours on the U.S. west coast, the launching of an Early Warning System for potential disruptions in semiconductor manufacturing, including in Asia, and this week’s Department of Energy announcement establishing Li-Bridge — a new public-private alliance committed to accelerating development of a robust and secure domestic supply chain for lithium-based batteries. Today’s announcements build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing work under Executive Order (E.O.) 14017 to build resilient supply chains that the President issued in February.Joining the President at the Summit are Leaders and representatives from Australia, Canada, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the European Union, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Italy, Republic of Korea, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. They will discuss how we tackle the immediate supply chain challenges from this unprecedented economic recovery and build long-term supply chain reliance for the future.Today, the President also announced new domestic steps he will take to continue building supply chain resilience:###"
