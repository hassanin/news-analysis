    "content": "One of our country’s most sacred obligations is to care for America’s veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors. Last year, the President delivered on this commitment by signing the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), the most significant bill in American history to address veterans’ exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances. Under the law, more than 5 million veterans will be eligible for services, including expanded access to healthcare and disability compensation benefits. Under the President’s leadership, the Administration has also taken action to address veteran suicide, advance equity across veterans’ services, and expand access to specialized cancer screenings and reproductive health care.The Budget builds on this progress with proposals to honor America’s commitment to veterans and military families:###"
