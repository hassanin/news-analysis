The two sides had candid and constructive discussions, building on the Summit between President Biden and President Xi in Woodside, California in November 2023.  The two sides discussed the ongoing implementation of key outcomes from the Summit, including the resumption of military-to-military communication and cooperation to combat illicit drug manufacturing and trafficking.  The two sides also discussed global and regional security issues, including challenges in the Middle East, Russia’s war against Ukraine, and cross-Strait issues.  Mr. Finer stressed the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea.  Mr. Finer and Minister Liu reaffirmed support for continued high-level diplomacy and interactions between the United States and the People’s Republic of China.###"
