    "content": "Today, on the 13th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) becoming law, the White House released 51 state and territory fact sheets highlighting how extreme MAGA House Republicans’ plans to repeal the ACA and gut Medicaid will devastate working families. The fact sheets demonstrate how Congressional Republicans’ reported proposals will raise premiums and health care costs, threaten health care for Americans with pre-existing health conditions, slash protections against catastrophic medical bills, and will balloon waitlists for quality care for seniors and people with disabilities.Since becoming law in 2010, the ACA has helped a total of 40.2 million Americans gain quality, affordable health care, lowered health care costs for families, and provided critical coverage of services like cancer detection and mental health treatment.President Joe Biden has built on the progress made under the ACA by lowering health care prices, increasing the number of Americans with insurance, and capping out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare.Fact Sheets by State and Territory:###"
