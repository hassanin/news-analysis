    "content": "The Biden-Harris Administration today announced a historic agreement to work in partnership with Tribes and States from the Pacific Northwest to restore wild salmon populations, expand Tribally sponsored clean energy production, and provide stability for communities that depend on the Columbia River System for agriculture, energy, recreation, and transportation.The Biden-Harris Administration has made an unprecedented commitment to honor the United States’ obligations to Tribal Nations and protect and restore America’s natural wonders for future generations, while also recognizing the important benefits that the Columbia River System provides to communities and businesses throughout the region. Building on two years of regional engagement, in September President Biden directed Federal agencies to prioritize the restoration of healthy and abundant salmon, steelhead, and other native fish populations in the Columbia River Basin. Today’s agreement, when combined with other funding that the Administration is anticipated to deliver to the region, will bring more than $1 billion in new Federal investments to wild fish restoration in the Columbia River Basin over the next decade and facilitate the build-out of at least one to three gigawatts of Tribally sponsored clean energy production.  Under President Biden’s leadership, the Federal government is charting a new path forward, in partnership with States and Tribal Nations in the region, for the restoration of wild salmon and other native fish in the Columbia River Basin while safeguarding and strengthening sustainable energy and water resources. The agreement enables an unprecedented 10-year break from decades-long litigation against the Federal government’s operation of dams in the Pacific Northwest.As part of the agreement, the Biden-Harris Administration is committing to:Wild salmon, steelhead, and other native fish populations in the Columbia River Basin are essential to the culture, economy, religion, and way of life of Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples. Due to the Federal government’s construction and operation of Federal dams, private dam building, population growth, and other factors, wild populations of many salmon and steelhead species are severely depleted, substantially harming the Tribes that rely on them. Climate change is further imperiling these fish populations through warming water temperatures, altered stream flows, and other stressors. Since the Federal dams were constructed, 13 salmon and steelhead species have been listed as threatened or endangered, and none have recovered.This announcement builds on a historic agreement the Biden-Harris Administration announced earlier this year to support Tribally led efforts to bring back salmon populations in the Upper Columbia River Basin. The Upper Columbia agreement between the United States, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, and the Spokane Tribe of Indians includes $200 million over 20 years from the Bonneville Power Administration.###"
