    "content": "This afternoon, the President and Vice President joined a meeting with chairs and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, Congressional Women’s Caucus, and White House senior staff to discuss continued progress on negotiations for the Build Back Better Act.Their conversations centered on momentum toward a final deal, and on groundbreaking, long-sought provisions that each of the caucuses have fought for over many years. The President, the Vice President, and the Members agreed that the package they are closing in on would mean unprecedented progress for the constituencies these caucuses represent. They also discussed the fight to ensure that the package delivers the biggest investment in defeating climate change in history; game-changing reforms to help families afford the costs of raising children like the Child Tax Credit, paid family and medical leave, and universal pre-school; and historic strides in terms of making health care more affordable.They agreed to keep pushing for an agreement as soon as possible, so that each component of the President’s economic vision—the Build Back Better Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal—can become law and start giving middle class families breathing room as soon as possible.Meeting attendees:Chair Joyce Beatty (OH-03), Congressional Black CaucusMajority Whip Jim Clyburn (SC-06), Congressional Black CaucusHouse Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (NY-08), Congressional Black CaucusChair Raul Ruiz (CA-36), Congressional Hispanic CaucusRepresentative Nydia Velazquez (NY-07), Congressional Hispanic CaucusRepresentative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), Congressional Hispanic CaucusChair Judy Chu (CA-27), Congressional Asian Pacific American CaucusRepresentative Andy Kim (NJ-03), Congressional Asian Pacific American CaucusRepresentative Marilyn Strickland (WA-10), Congressional Asian Pacific American CaucusChair David Cicilline (RI-01), Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality CaucusCo-Chair Angie Craig (MN-02), Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality CaucusCo-Chair Chris Pappas (NH-01), Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality CaucusCo-Chair Jackie Speier (CA-14), Congressional Women’s CaucusCo-Chair Brenda Lawrence (MI-14), Congressional Women’s CaucusRepresentative Veronica Escobar (TX-16), Congressional Women’s Caucus###"
