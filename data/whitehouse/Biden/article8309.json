    "content": "Yesterday, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials convened a meeting with manufacturers of RSV immunizations for infants, including Sanofi and AstraZeneca, to receive an update on supply, and to underscore the need for manufacturers to continue efforts to meet current and projected demand through the commercial market. This meeting follows several in-person and virtual meetings, including last month when manufacturers announced the availability of hundreds of thousands of additional doses at the urging of the administration, including 230,000 additional doses, which providers and states will begin to be able to order starting next week. Parents of infants under eight months can speak with their health care provider about how to obtain an RSV immunization to protect their infant. Additionally, expectant mothers can talk to their doctors about the maternal RSV vaccine. Senior Administration officials and manufacturers also pledged to continue conversations on the importance of proactively planning to increase availability, and to take steps now to meet projected demand for the 2024-25 viral season. The Administration will continue this work to ensure every family that needs an RSV immunization can access it.  ###"
