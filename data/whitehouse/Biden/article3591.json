    "content": "Today, Washington State has become the tenth state in the nation alongside Washington, D.C. to ban assault weapons and get weapons of war off America’s streets. President Biden commends the leadership of Washington Governor Jay Inslee, and legislative leaders, as well as the advocates, survivors, and elected officials who fought for years to make today a reality. In so doing, they have made every community in the state – from Seattle to Spokane and everywhere in between – safer and more secure.###"
