That’s why the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to increasing and supporting the adoption of community school models across the country.Community schools meet the unique needs of the neighborhoods they serve by leveraging local non-profit, private sector, and public partnerships to bring wraparound services into school buildings, such as mental health supports, dental services, and assistance with shelter and nutrition. They operate with the assistance of school staff who coordinate with school administrators, stakeholders, and local organizations to deliver these services and more to students, their families, and members of the community. Research has shown that these schools contribute to increased student attendance, on-time grade progression, and high school graduation.In the most recent bipartisan funding bill, the President secured $150 million for the Full-Service Community Schools program. This means the program is twice as large as last year and five times as large as when President Biden came into office.“Schools have always been the heart of our communities—where students learn to be good citizens, where families come together for a common cause, where towns find pride…students perform their best—and are happiest—when their parents and educators work together, when their families get the support they need—as soon as they need it.” – First Lady Jill Biden Communities in Schools (CIS) Leadership Town Hall Conference, October 2022.Today, in recognition of the need to marshal resources from across the government to support community schools, the Biden-Harris Administration is:EXPANDING THE FULL-SERVICE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PROGRAMThe Department of Education is announcing todaythe 2022 recipients of the FSCS program grant competition.

This year’s grant competition received the largest number of applications in the history of the program, demonstrating the enormous need for and interest in advancing a continuum of coordinated support to address students’ social, emotional and mental health. By continuing to expand the reach of Full-Service Community Schools, we will support students’ academic recovery, as well as the health and well-being of communities across the country.NEW TOOLKIT HIGHLIGHTS PROGRAMS ACROSS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT SUPPORT COMMUNITY SCHOOLSThe Administration supports the Full-Service Community School model because of the powerful effects these schools have on students’ academic success and overall well-being. Studies have found that well-implemented community schools—with integrated student supports, active family and community engagement, expanded and enriched learning time, and collaborative leadership practices—can lead to improved student and school outcomes, particularly for students in high-poverty schools. Yet communities can face difficulties identifying resources to establish or expand Full-Service Community Schools because they exist across the federal government. Today, the White House is releasing a Toolkit of Federal Resources to Support Community Schools.The toolkit lists relevant grant programs by federal agency and explains how those grants can be used to provide student services at community schools. It also includes new commitments from various federal agencies to support community schools, including the following:###"
