    "content": "Thirty-five years ago today, terrorists detonated a bomb aboard Pan Am Flight 103 as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people onboard or on the ground, including 190 Americans. Those lost that day included students at Syracuse University, spouses heading home to their families after business trips, parents traveling with their children, and citizens from 21 countries, each with their own hopes and aspirations for their futures. Their loss was a tragedy that reverberated around the globe—and one that is still felt today by all those families and friends who continue to grieve for their loved ones.   The United States will never waver in our pursuit of those who inflict despicable acts of terrorism. We will never stop working to identify and bring to justice anyone who commits an act of terrorism against Americans at home or abroad. In the decades since this horrific attack, the United States and our Scottish partners have not stopped in our pursuit of justice: last year, the United States successfully took custody of one of the main suspects behind the bombing, Abu Agila Mohammad Mas’ud Kheir Al-Marimi, and now he will face charges for his alleged involvement in this horrific terrorist plot.    On this sad anniversary, we honor those who lost their lives by upholding our commitment to protecting our homeland and countering terrorist threats around the world.###"
