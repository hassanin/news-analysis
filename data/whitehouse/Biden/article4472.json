    "content": "This morning President Biden met virtually with a bipartisan group of senators to discuss Russia’s military build-up on Ukraine’s borders. The group included senators who returned yesterday from a Congressional delegation to Ukraine, where they met with Ukrainian leadership and affirmed the United States’ longstanding bipartisan support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. President Biden and the senators exchanged views on the best ways the United States can continue to work closely with our allies and partners in support of Ukraine, including both ongoing diplomacy to try to resolve the current crisis and deterrence measures. President Biden commended the strong history of support for Ukraine from both sides of the aisle, and agreed to keep working closely with Congress as the Administration prepares to impose significant consequences in response to further Russian aggression against Ukraine.Senators at this briefing included Senators Rob Portman (OH), Jeanne Shaheen (NH), Kevin Cramer (ND), Amy Klobuchar (MN), Chris Murphy (CT), Richard Blumenthal (CT), and Roger Wicker (MS) – all of whom participated in the Congressional delegation. The virtual meeting also included Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Jim Risch (ID). ###"
