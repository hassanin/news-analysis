Año.  Mr. Sullivan reiterated U.S. support for our Philippine allies following the PRC Coast Guard and maritime militia’s dangerous and unlawful actions on October 22 obstructing a routine Philippine resupply to Second Thomas Shoal.  Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Año reaffirmed the enduring alliance and friendship between our nations and discussed upcoming U.S.-Philippine engagements and ways to further strengthen our close partnership.  Mr. Sullivan emphasized the ironclad U.S. alliance commitments to the Philippines under the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty, which extends to armed attacks on Philippine public vessels, aircraft, and armed forces—to include those of its Coast Guard—in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea.###"
