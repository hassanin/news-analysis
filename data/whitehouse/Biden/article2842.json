In a nod to the First Lady’s “EGGucation” theme, NASA sent one of the wooden Official White House Easter Eggs up to the International Space Station, where astronauts could demonstrate the laws of gravity to students everywhere. Videos of the Official White House Easter Egg in space will be available on the White House’s social media platforms leading up to the event.  In total, approximately 30,000 people will take part in this year’s Easter “EGGucation” Roll, including thousands of military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. Families of the U.S.S. Delaware and U.S.S. Gabrielle Giffords, the U.S. Naval vessels for which the First Lady is the sponsor, are among those invited to attend. Tickets for the general public were distributed to guests from all across the country through an online public lottery. The American Egg Board is continuing its 45-year legacy of participation in the event and support of the Egg Roll.   This year’s event will be broken into nine sessions, beginning at 7:00 AM ET and ending at 7:00 PM ET.  Follow along with the White House Easter “EGGucation” Roll activities with #EasterEggRoll and #EGGucation, and the official @White House, @POTUS, @FLOTUS social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.This event will be open to pre-credentialed media.
