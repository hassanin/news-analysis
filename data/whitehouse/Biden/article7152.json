The Biden-Harris Administration’s 2024 budget requested an unprecedented $1.2 billion in economic, development, and security assistance for the nations of Southeast Asia, in addition to $90 million dedicated solely to engagement with ASEAN and efforts to strengthen ASEAN institutions. Building on the success of the 2022 U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit in Washington, DC, these resources are intended to support the robust implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and ensure U.S.-ASEAN cooperation delivers concrete benefits for the people of Southeast Asia, the United States, and the broader Indo-Pacific.At the 2022 U.S.-ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh, the United States and ASEAN took the historic step of upgrading our relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP). To ensure this elevated partnership reaches its full potential, the leaders of ASEAN and the United States are announcing their intent to establish, through a public-private partnership, a U.S.-ASEAN Center in Washington, DC. The Center will serve as a key hub for ASEAN’s engagement with the United States. Subject to consultations between ASEAN and the United States, the Center’s future activities may include:Under the auspices of the U.S.-ASEAN Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, President Biden and Vice President Harris have already overseen an unprecedented expansion in U.S.-ASEAN relations, marked by the launch of new ministerial dialogue processes on health, environment and climate, energy, transportation, and women’s empowerment, as well as elevated engagement within existing dialogue tracks on foreign affairs, economics, and defense – led on the U.S. side by Secretary Becerra, Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Kerry and Administrator Regan, Secretary Granholm, Secretary Buttigieg, Administrator Power, Secretary Blinken, Ambassador Tai, and Secretary Austin, respectively. Additionally, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has now extended the U.S.-ASEAN Regional Development Cooperation Agreement to 2029, and the United States is rapidly scaling the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment in Southeast Asia. In the years to come, the United States and ASEAN will continue working together to institutionalize and expand cooperation in each of these important areas, in order to promote ASEAN as an “Epicentrum of Growth” and advance a free and open region that is increasingly connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient.INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE INNOVATION ECONOMY, AND HIGH-QUALITY INFRASTRUCTUREThe Biden-Harris Administration continues to strengthen U.S. economic cooperation with Southeast Asia and ASEAN in pursuit of inclusive growth and broad-based prosperity.

Ministers also endorsed the 2023-2024 ASEAN-U.S. Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement and Expanded Economic Engagement Work Plan. In June 2023, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) co-chaired a U.S.-ASEAN Senior Officials Dialogue on Transportation in preparation for a U.S.-ASEAN transportation ministerial, deepening U.S.-ASEAN cooperation on transportation infrastructure and the development of a regional electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem.
