    "content": "The Biden-Harris Administration continues to take significant and historic actions to disrupt the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and dismantle firearms trafficking networks.  Drug traffickers’ supply of firearms enables them to grow their enterprises and move deadly drugs, including illicit fentanyl, into the United States. They use these weapons, which consist of everything from handguns to high caliber and assault weapons, against the Mexican people, including law enforcement and military personnel who try to stop their operations. That’s why discovering, disrupting, and dismantling firearms trafficking networks is critical to the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to combat illicit fentanyl.On June 14, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, Deputy Homeland Security Secretary John Tien, U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar, Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Steve Dettelbach, and Deputy Homeland Security Advisor Josh Geltzer participated in the Southbound Firearms Trafficking Coordination Meeting at ATF Headquarters to discuss ongoing efforts to stem the trafficking of firearms from the United States into Mexico. They also identified near-term actions to scale up collaboration across the federal enterprise, including surging resources to support Operation Southbound, a multi-agency enforcement operation led by ATF that includes Department of Homeland Security (DHS) law enforcement partners.  The United States is committed to address firearms trafficking into Mexico that contributes to violence and the trafficking of illicit fentanyl by:Expanding Firearms Trafficking InvestigationsHolding Traffickers Accountable and Deploying New AuthoritiesCountering Rise of Ghost Guns and Other Dangerous WeaponsStemming the Supply of Illegal GunsContinuing to Focus on U.S. Outbound Operations and EnforcementDeepening Collaboration with MexicoDriving Ongoing Research###"
