Martin O’Malley to head the Social Security Administration. The SSA does critical work that millions of Americans depend on every day, and the more than 56,000 career public servants who make up its workforce deserve high quality leadership. The next commissioner will have the opportunity to attract and retain top talent, improve the employee experience, make strategic decisions to modernize agency operations and improve how the agency delivers critical services to the public.

Like @POTUS, O’Malley supports expanding Social Security’s modest benefits, not cutting them.” [Tweet, 7/26/23]Social Security Works: “Social Security Works applauds the nomination of Governor O’Malley, a longtime Social Security champion. Like President Biden, O’Malley supports expanding Social Security’s modest benefits, not cutting them. At a time when Social Security is under attack from Republicans in Congress, O’Malley is the fighter that the American people need at SSA’s helm…The Senate should swiftly confirm O’Malley so he can work to provide the American people with that first-class service and fight for increasing, not cutting, their benefits. Notably, SSA has not had a Senate-confirmed commissioner nominated by a Democratic president since 2001. During that time, Congressional Republicans have starved SSA of resources, resulting in backlogs and long waits. With staffing the lowest it has been in a quarter of a century, SSA’s hardworking and dedicated public servants are overworked and underpaid. Governor O’Malley is a proven champion and fighter. As commissioner, he will be in prime position to persuade Congress to allow SSA to spend just a few percentage points more of Social Security’s $2.8 trillion surplus on administrative expenses, as President Biden has requested. We are confident that O’Malley, working closely with President Biden, will fight not only for expanded benefits and against cuts, but also for opening new field offices and against closing existing ones…” [Press Release, 7/26/23]Social Security Works (@SSWorks): “Social Security Works applauds the nomination of @MartinOMalley, a longtime Social Security champion, as the next next Commissioner of the Social Security Administration. Like @POTUS, O’Malley supports expanding Social Security’s modest benefits, not cutting them.” [Tweet, 7/26/23]Ben Jealous, Executive Director, Sierra Club: “Martin O’Malley is a progressive leader with the executive skills to get things done. Whether it was repealing the death penalty, passing marriage equality, restoring voting rights, raising the minimum wage, or being a fierce defender of the environment and addressing climate change, O’Malley’s track record of accomplishments makes him an outstanding choice to lead Social Security.” [Statement, 7/26/23]Alliance for Retired Americans (@ActiveRetirees): “Americans earn their Social Security benefits, paying into the system with every paycheck. They deserve world-class service from a fully staffed workforce equipped with the best tools and technology available. The Alliance is confident that under Governor O’Malley’s leadership, SSA will deliver.” [Tweet, 2/26/23]Richard Fiesta, Executive Director, Alliance for Retired Americans: “Members of the Alliance for Retired Americans are pleased that President Biden has nominated former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley to be the next Social Security Administration (SSA) Commissioner. The SSA needs a strong Commissioner now more than ever. With 10,000 Americans turning 65 each day, the workload increases every day and the budget has been woefully inadequate to meet the needs of seniors, people with disabilities and all American families. Gov. O’Malley has a proven track record and the experience to navigate these challenges and ensure that Americans are able to get the benefits they have earned. American workers have earned their Social Security benefits, paying into the system with every paycheck. They deserve world class service from a fully staffed workforce equipped with the best tools and technology available. The Alliance for Retired Americans is confident that under Governor O’Malley’s leadership SSA will deliver. There is no time to waste. We urge the Senate to confirm Gov. O’Malley without delay.” [Press Release, 7/26/23]Matthew Biggs, President, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE):  “As a native Marylander, I know well Gov. O’Malley’s record of advocating for workers, students, the poor, our retirees, and other people who too often get left behind. I also commend him and his family for their tradition of service and generations of thoughtful, effective leadership in all three branches of state government, including their support for working families and the unions that represent them. Maryland is a better place to work, live, learn and breathe, thanks to their contributions. Gov. O’Malley is ideally qualified to lead SSA and IFPTE enthusiastically endorses his nomination.” [Statement, 7/26/23]National Council on Aging (@NCOAging): “📣NCOA is pleased that @POTUS nominated Martin O’Malley to be @SocialSecurity Commissioner. Gov. O’ Malley has dedicated his career to service and understands public programs like #SocialSecurity are truly a lifeline to millions of #OlderAdults. Looking forward to working him.GovNavigators: “GovNavigators are huge fans of Martin J. O’Malley. And Social Security needs someone just like him. He’s the father of Citistat and Statestat — which inspired key amendments to GPRA. He’s sure to bring those proven practices to SSA. And the country will be better off for it. Thanks for accepting the challenge, Governor!” [Press Release, 7/26/23]Advance Maryland: “Excited to see Maryland’s own Governor @MartinOMalley in this role. As governor, he expanded Medicaid, improved access to data & transparency, fought for Dreamers, and led efforts to make Maryland a more inclusive state. Great choice by @POTUS!” [Tweet, 7/26/23]National Academy of Public Administration, “Congratulations to #NAPAFellow @MartinOMalley” […] [Tweet, 7/26/23]Max Richtman, President and CEO, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare: “We commend President Biden for nominating former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley as Social Security Commissioner. It has been more than 20 years since the Senate has confirmed a permanent commissioner nominated by a Democratic president, and it is way past time for the Social Security Administration (SSA) to have one. As a confirmed commissioner, Martin O’Malley will be able to advocate effectively for SSA, which has been chronically underfunded and has struggled to provide adequate customer service. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Governor O’Malley championed the expansion of Social Security. He proposed boosting benefits and adopting a more generous (the CPI-E) for calculating COLAs — while adjusting the payroll wage cap so that the wealthy pay their fair share.  He insisted that ‘it is our responsibility to ensure that Americans who put in a lifetime of hard work are able to retire with the dignity they deserve.’ American workers’ payroll taxes largely fund the SSA.  They have every right to expect the agency that administers their benefits to be fully funded — with a permanent commissioner at the helm. The Senate should confirm Governor O’Malley in a timely manner when it returns from August recess.” [Press Release, 7/26/23]National Asian Pacific Center on Aging (NAPCA): “NAPCA supports the nomination of former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley to be next Administrator of the Social Security Administration. We need strong leadership to ensure that AA & NH/PI older adults are receiving critical financial benefits.” [Tweet, 7/26/23]###"
