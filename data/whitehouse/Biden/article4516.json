    "content": "Today, Chief of Staff Jeff Zients hosted an Investing in America Cabinet meeting. During the meeting, President Biden stopped by to thank members of his Cabinet and his Administration for implementing his historic economic agenda and delivering for hardworking families – including the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the American Rescue Plan – and for their participation in the ongoing three-week long Investing in America tour.Investing in America Cabinet members and Administration officials discussed the impact of President Biden and Vice President Harris’ legislative successes that White House and Cabinet officials have been highlighting throughout the Investing in America tour, including how this Administration has unleashed over $435 billion of new private sector investments in manufacturing and clean energy, awarded funding for over 23,000 new infrastructure projects, and brought affordable, high-speed internet to over 17 million households since the President took office. They also discussed what’s at stake if Congressional Republicans get their way and repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, slash funding for manufacturing, innovation, and research, and put at risk hundreds of billions of dollars of investment we’ve seen unleashed as a result of the President’s economic agenda. Over the course of three weeks, President Biden, Vice President Harris, the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and Administration officials are traveling to 25 states as part of the Investing in America tour, including Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin.Participants of the Investing in America Cabinet meeting included:###"
