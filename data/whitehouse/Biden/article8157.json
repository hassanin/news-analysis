They also saw the courage and resilience of the people of Maui. As the President made clear, he is committed to delivering everything the people of Hawaiʻi need, and his Administration will be there as long as it takes to complete response efforts. Throughout this process, the Administration is focused on respecting sacred lands, cultures, and traditions.Since the onset of this unprecedented tragedy, President Biden launched a whole-of-government effort to support residents and affected communities – and as soon as Hawaiʻi Governor Josh Green requested a Major Disaster Declaration, the President signed it. As the recovery moves into the next phase, President Biden on Monday appointed FEMA Region 9 Administrator Bob Fenton as the Chief Federal Response Coordinator for Maui. In this role, Fenton will oversee the Federal government’s long-term recovery work on the ground.Thousands of personnel from across dozens of Federal departments and agencies continue working with state and local partners on the ground to assess ongoing needs and provide resources and personnel to support response efforts.Below are updated statistics and actions from the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole of government response, including a new U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announcement of a $1.3 million funding allocation to help communities on Maui in the wake of the wildfires through HUD’s new Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing (RUSH) program, a rapid response program to address homelessness by filling in federal assistance gaps in communities hit by disasters. The Administration encourages individuals impacted by the disaster to register for Federal assistance at www.disasterassistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-3362 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Additionally, as we work to provide communications to meet the needs of those impacted by the Hawaiʻi wildfires, FEMA has multiple language translations available. Impacted individuals can also visit FEMA’s newly opened joint Disaster Recovery Center at the University of Hawaiʻi Maui College, located at 310 W. Ka’ahumanu Avenue, Kahului, Hawaiʻi, to speak personally with FEMA specialists, get assistance registering for disaster assistance, get in touch with voluntary organizations offering additional support services, and have access to other federal and state resources.  The doors are open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. HST seven days a week.Here is an update on the Biden-Harris Administration’s coordinated federal response:SBA is also conducting outreach to businesses throughout Maui County to take advantage of the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, and staff are working with survivors where they are by conducting outreach in shelters, state-run Family Assistance Centers, and door-to-door campaigns. Additionally, HUD is providing a 90-day relief from foreclosures of Federal Housing Administration-insured mortgages and home equity conversion mortgages. Homeowners affected by the disaster should contact their mortgage or loan servicer immediately. They can also call the FHA Resource Center at 1-800-304-9320 for additional information and visit the FHA Disaster Relief site to learn more about disaster relief options for FHA homeowners. HUD also released regulatory and administrative waivers to help communities accelerate their recovery. This includes funding for housing rehabilitation and reconstruction, homebuyer programs replacing disaster damaged residences, infrastructure improvements and assistance to people at risk of homelessness. HUD has assigned experienced Disaster Technical Assistance providers that will be available remotely and, on the ground, to support local leaders help communities and families that were experiencing homelessness before the devastating fires and those that may require homeless services because of the fires.###"
