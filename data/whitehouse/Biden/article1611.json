The meeting brought together leaders of U.S. climate modeling centers with academic experts on climate risk, representatives from the insurance, reinsurance, and catastrophe risk modeling industries, Federal and state financial regulators, and representative from Federal agencies tasked with managing climate risks.The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes the economic, financial, and fiscal risks posed by climate change. Shortly after taking office, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk which directs agencies across the Federal government to take steps to quantify and manage climate-related risks.
