And in those hours, what was normally an ordinary town and bridge, transformed into a bright, sparkling landscape, glittering as if covered in magic.That’s how children often see the world this time of year: with magic, wonder, and joy. And that’s what inspired our White House holiday theme.What’s more magical, wonderful, and joyful than an ice rink on the South Lawn of the White House?I hope each of you enjoy your time here at the White House and that the memories you make will stay with you for all the holidays to come.***Wasn’t that incredible?Let’s give all of our performers another round of applause.I want to thank the organizations who helped make this possible: the National Park Service, the National Park Foundation, Comcast, the NHL, the NHL Players Association, and Riedell.Because of you, we get to bring a little more magic, wonder, and joy to the White House.Now, who’s ready to skate?###"
