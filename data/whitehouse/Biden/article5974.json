The leaders showcased the ways in which PGII partners are coming together to finance transformative infrastructure and to mobilize the private sector as drivers of quality global infrastructure and investment. This event comes at the end of a week of additional PGII project announcements by President Biden, including at COP, the ASEAN Summit, and in a bilateral meeting with G20 host, Indonesia. In his remarks, President Biden delivered an update on PGII’s progress and impact to date.
