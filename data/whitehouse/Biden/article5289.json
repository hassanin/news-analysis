    "content": "With less than two weeks before the end of the fiscal year, extreme House Republicans are playing partisan games with peoples’ lives and marching our country toward a government shutdown instead of working in a bipartisan manner to keep the government open and address emergency needs for the American people.The continuing resolution they introduced this week makes indiscriminate cuts to programs that millions of hardworking Americans count on—violating the agreement the Speaker negotiated with President Biden and rejecting the bipartisan approach of the Senate.

So what would it mean for the American people if House Republicans’ proposed 8% cuts were extended for the entire year?IMPACTS OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS’ EXTREME CR:###"
