    "content": "We welcome the restoration of diplomatic ties between Bahrain and Qatar, two close U.S. partners and Major Non-NATO Allies. The United States has been working since the start of the Biden Administration to encourage regional integration, de-escalation, and rapprochement between U.S. partners. A fully unified Gulf Cooperation Council, of which Bahrain and Qatar are key members, is also an important step towards establishing a more stable and prosperous Middle East region, including through more integrated commercial, economic, and defense arrangements. The United States looks forward to working with all of our partners as we advance this shared vision of a more integrated, stable, and prosperous region, which ultimately serves the interests of the United States and the American people. ###"
