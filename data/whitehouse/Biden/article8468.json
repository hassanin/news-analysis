    "content": "Bill Spriggs was a giant in the field of economics. As Chair of the Economics Department at Howard University and Chief Economist for the AFL-CIO, Bill Spriggs fought to build an economy that worked for all Americans. He understood and spoke clearly about the deep disparities that exist in our nation and dedicated his career to closing those gaps. The son of two World War II veterans, Bill carried on his family’s legacy of public service through his years of work in government. Bill was a friend for many years. I will remember him for his incisive mind, deep wisdom, and abiding faith in the power of economic policy to create justice, equity, and intergenerational prosperity. Today, Doug and my prayers are with Bill’s family and loved ones. ###"
