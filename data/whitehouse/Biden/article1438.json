    "content": "Unemployment near a record low and the share of working age Americans who have jobs at a 20-year high: that’s Bidenomics.   Our economy added 187,000 jobs last month, and we’ve added 13.4 million jobs since I took office — more jobs added in two and a half years than during any president’s four-year term. The unemployment rate is 3.5%, marking a full year and half below 4%. This follows recent news that our economy continues to grow, while inflation has fallen by nearly two thirds and is at its lowest level in more than two years. We’re growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up, lowering costs for hardworking families, and making smart investments in America.### "
