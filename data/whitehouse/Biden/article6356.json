They discussed our shared efforts to address the global climate crisis, including the recent U.S. passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and preparations for COP-27 in Egypt. They also discussed transatlantic cooperation to address Russia’s weaponization of energy and the need to ensure our ongoing efforts to meet acute near-term energy needs are matched by a redoubled commitment to accelerating the clean energy transition and reducing Europe’s dependence on fossil fuels. ###"
