We also pray for the recovery of Wadea’s mother, Hanaan Shahin, who was stabbed 12 times in the same attack. The Department of Justice has announced a hate crimes investigation.Hate has no place in America. We unequivocally condemn hate and Islamophobia and stand with the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim American communities. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue working to protect our communities against hate and senseless violence.###"
