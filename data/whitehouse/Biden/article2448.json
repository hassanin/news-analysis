    "content": "Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing that the United States will strengthen its strategic partnership with the Kingdom of Bahrain during a visit to Washington by His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Bahrain, Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. Bahrain is one of the United States of America’s longest and closest partners in the Middle East, host to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, a Major Non-NATO Ally, and a Major Security Partner.  To build on these ties, the Administration is launching the “Comprehensive Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement” (C-SIPA) with Bahrain – a new framework to promote cooperation across a range of areas, from defense and security to science, technology, and trade.  The Crown Prince’s visit to Washington is the culmination of nearly a year’s worth of diplomatic engagement, including multiple trips to Manama by senior U.S. officials, and follows on the Crown Prince’s visit to Washington in 2022 and his bilateral meeting with Vice President Harris.At the Jeddah Summit in July 2022, the President outlined his broad and affirmative vision for a Middle East that is more secure, prosperous, and integrated both regionally and with the world economy.  C-SIPA further advances that vision by formalizing cooperation to deter conflict in the region, enhance regional stability, de-escalate tensions, and bolster trade and economic cooperation – including through the development and deployment of advanced technologies with trusted vendors.  This agreement follows the announcement last week at the G20 of a transformational economic corridor between India, the Middle East, and Europe, the development of which will open unprecedented opportunities for the Gulf region, which serves as an economic engine and gateway between continents.  The United States is pleased to finalize C-SIPA and is poised to begin its implementation in earnest.Comprehensive Security Integration and Prosperity AgreementSecretary Blinken and Crown Prince/Prime Minister Salman today signed C-SIPA in an official ceremony at the State Department.  This new bilateral agreement can serve as a cornerstone for cooperation among a broader grouping of countries that share mutual interests and a common vision with respect to deterrence, diplomacy, security and economic integration, and de-escalation of conflicts in the Middle East region.  C-SIPA is the latest manifestation of the United States’ enduring commitment to Bahrain and to the region in support of peace and shared prosperity.After two decades of major conflicts in the Middle East region, the American people benefit from a region that is more peaceful, more secure, and more integrated internally and with the broader global economy.  Our partnership under C-SIPA will deliver on that goal by:U.S.-Bahrain Strategic PartnershipThe United States established official relations with Bahrain in 1971, but America’s cultural and social ties with Bahrain go back to the nineteenth century and the arrival of American missionaries who built a school, hospital, and church – all of which are still in operation today.  Since then, Bahrain has become one of the United States’ closest partners in the Middle East region.Defense and Security CooperationRegional Integration CollaborationCommercial and Economic TiesGovernance and Human Rights###"
