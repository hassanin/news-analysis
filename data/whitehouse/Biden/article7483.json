    "content": "Today, the U.S. has had the highest economic growth among the world’s leading economies since the pandemic. We’ve added over 13 million jobs, more jobs in two years than any President has added in a four-year term.​And folks, that’s no accident. That’s Bidenomics in action. Bidenomics is about building the economy from the middle out and bottom up – not the top down by making three fundamental changes.First, making smart investments in America. Second, educating and empowering American workers to grow the middle class. And third, promoting competition to lower costs and help small businesses. ###"
