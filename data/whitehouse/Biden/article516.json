I’m grateful to Kaiser Permanente and the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions for coming together in good faith to ensure these workers can continue caring for our neighbors and loved ones. Health care workers and support staff kept our hospitals – and our nation– going during the dark months of the pandemic. They had our backs during one of our nation’s toughest times. We must continue to have theirs. I’m also grateful for the role Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su played in bringing these parties together.  This isn’t the first time Acting Secretary Su has helped essential workers and their employers reach an agreement. She continues to play an integral role helping my administration and workers across this country build an economy that works for everyone. I always say that collective bargaining works. It works for UPS drivers and dock workers, writers, and millions of American workers who exercise their right to participate in a union. I’m heartened to see health care workers and their employers take this critical step towards securing the pay, benefits, and working conditions these heroes deserve.###"
