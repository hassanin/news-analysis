    "content": "Today, President Biden is taking further action to demonstrate our commitment to the Nicaraguan people by expanding the tools to hold the Ortega-Murillo regime accountable for its escalating human rights violations, continued dismantling of democratic institutions, attacks on civil society, and increasing security cooperation with Russia. President Biden signed an Executive Order (E.O.) that amends E.O. 13851 (Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Nicaragua) to expand the authorities available to increase targeted pressure on the Ortega-Murillo regime. This will give the Administration additional means to target the regime while allowing the flexibility necessary to continue to support the people of Nicaragua.In the lead up to Nicaragua’s November 2021 sham elections, the Ortega-Murillo regime arbitrarily detained dozens of political opponents and pro-democracy activists. Since then, the limited remaining democratic space in the country has shrunk even further as the Ortega-Murillo regime shuttered over 2,000 non-governmental organizations and subjected political prisoners to extremely harsh conditions. And, the Nicaraguan regime has increased its attacks on faith leaders and closed private universities, robbing Nicaragua’s youth of their future and politicizing education. While the United States and our allies continue to take steps to hold Russia accountable for its war of aggression in Ukraine, the Ortega-Murillo regime has increased its cooperation with Moscow by authorizing the continued presence of Russian military personnel and equipment in the country. The regime was one of only four countries — and the only country in Latin America — to vote with Russia against an October 2022 United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning its attempted illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine.The Biden-Harris Administration is today taking the following actions:Today’s actions build on recent efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to support the Nicaraguan people and hold the Ortega-Murillo regime accountable. This includes the designation of Nicaragua’s state mining company, ENIMINAS in June 2022, and the reallocation of the country’s sugar quota by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in July 2022.###"
