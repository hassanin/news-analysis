She also outlined steps that the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to protect voting rights and our democracy, including by ensuring voter registration information is available on vote.gov in 17 languages. And, she once again called on Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.The voting rights leaders in attendance shared their concerns about threats to voting rights taking place across the country, including the issues of mis- and disinformation, voter intimidation, harassment of poll and election workers, and mass ballot challenges.
