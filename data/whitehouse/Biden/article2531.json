    "content": "We are deeply concerned by today’s developments out of Israel, which further underscore the urgent need for compromise.  As the President recently discussed with Prime Minister Netanyahu, democratic values have always been, and must remain, a hallmark of the U.S.-Israel relationship.  Democratic societies are strengthened by checks and balances, and fundamental changes to a democratic system should be pursued with the broadest possible base of popular support.  We continue to strongly urge Israeli leaders to find a compromise as soon as possible.  We believe that is the best path forward for Israel and all of its citizens.  U.S. support for Israel’s security and democracy remains ironclad.###"
