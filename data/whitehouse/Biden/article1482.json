    "content": "We must do everything we can to build a better America. Today, my Administration is marking another major step that will benefit American workers, communities, the economy, and our government. For the first time in history, Project Labor Agreements will be required on federal construction projects valued at or above $35 million. This means that projects funded by my Investing in America agenda will move faster and without delays, giving taxpayers better bang for their buck. Workers will have the security and peace of mind that collectively bargained wages and benefits bring, better pathways to good-paying jobs, and stronger health and safety protections. My father would always say, “a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about respect.” He was right, and I’m determined to keep fighting for American workers, who do the highest quality work in the world, to have the dignity and respect they deserve.###"
