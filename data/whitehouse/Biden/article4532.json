They also highlighted successes and challenges during the initial phase of the transition of COVID-19 vaccines to the commercial market. Participants shared best practices and challenges from past and current efforts from increasing access to vaccines, to ensuring residents and staff have access to tests, to building trust in vaccines, to tackling challenges of administering the vaccine, to more education about the reimbursement process, and more standardized education and training for front line staff.Senior White House Administration and Agency Officials thanked the leaders for their efforts to save lives and underscored our shared commitment to leveraging best practices and solving problems now and in the future as we continue our collective efforts to inform and protect older adults and other vulnerable Americans. Administration officials committed to an ongoing discussion with participants to track progress and address new concerns as they arise.Administration Participants Included:"
