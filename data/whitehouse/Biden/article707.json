    "content": "Harry Belafonte was one of our nation’s most powerful voices for change. As an activist, Harry Belafonte helped lead the fight for civil rights and human rights here and across the world—and inspired a generation of young leaders to fight for change. He used his voice and resources to champion the cause of racial justice, speaking out for freedom alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and supporting organizations like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. On stage and on screen, the “King of Calypso” captivated audiences around the globe. Like all true patriots, Harry Belafonte had the ability to see what could be and had the courage to work to realize that vision. He fought to help America live up to our highest ideals: dignity, equity, and justice for all. For years, it was my honor to call Harry a dear friend and rely on his wisdom and counsel. America has lost a giant. Today, Doug and I are praying for his family and loved ones.###"
