    "content": "President Joseph R. Biden met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine today to underscore the strong and abiding U.S. support for Ukraine’s fight for freedom.  The leaders discussed Ukraine’s self-defense against Russian aggression, including plans for the coming year.  President Biden announced a new package of security assistance for Ukraine and reiterated the critical need for immediate Congressional action to ensure we can continue to support Ukraine’s defense.  He also stressed the growing cooperation between U.S. and Ukrainian defense industries, enhanced by the successful U.S.-Ukraine Defense Industrial Base Conference last week.  President Zelenskyy briefed President Biden on Ukraine’s use of the corridor in the Black Sea to export its grain and other products, alleviating global food security concerns and contributing to Ukraine’s tax base.  President Biden stressed that Russia will not outlast the collective support for Ukraine by a coalition of over fifty countries brought together by U.S. leadership in defense of a rules-based international order based on a respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states. ###"
