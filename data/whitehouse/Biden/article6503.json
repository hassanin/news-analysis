    "content": "The President took office determined to move beyond failed trickle-down policies and fundamentally change the economic direction of our country. His plan—Bidenomics—is rooted in the recognition that the best way to grow the economy is from the middle out and the bottom up.A core tenet of Bidenomics is making smart public investments in America.This is based on the belief that targeted public investment can attract more private sector investment, rather than crowd it out. This is particularly true in sectors that are central to the long-term economic and national security interests of the United States—from our infrastructure, to semiconductors, to clean energy and climate security.The President has a unique approach to making smart investments in America.Today, the National Economic Council and the Investing in America Chief Economist released a brief that outlines the economic case for this approach—both the investments the President is making and his approach to making them in a way that benefits the middle class.Bidenomics invests in infrastructure, clean energy and electric vehicles, semiconductors, and innovation. Why? Because:Bidenomics chooses to invest in industries from the middle out and the bottom up.Why? Because:The President’s agenda is already powering a resurgence in American manufacturing.Construction of manufacturing facilities in the U.S. has grown nearly 100 percent in two years. From increasing private investment in semiconductors, electric vehicles, and clean energy to funding over 35,000 infrastructure projects to building a Made-in-America electric vehicle charging network, Bidenomics is leading to new investments in communities all across America.###"
