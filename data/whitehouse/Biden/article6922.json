The Trilateral Working Group subsequently held convenings in Canada in 2017, and in Mexico in 2018. The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in 2019 recognized the Trilateral Working Group as an important initiative, recommending Canada, Mexico, and the United States maintain our enduring commitment to tackling ongoing issues of violence against Indigenous women and girls in the region, including trafficking and the continuing crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people.###"
