During the meeting, the leaders acknowledged President Biden’s record of supporting our nations veterans, their families, caregivers and survivors — a core pillar of his Unity Agenda for the nation — and shared their top policy priorities for the coming year.   The leaders praised the Administration for ‘leaning into’ the implementation of the once-in-a- generation expansion of benefits and services, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act. Since President Biden signed the PACT Act into law last year, more than 478,000 veterans and survivors are already receiving benefits — ensuring that veterans exposed to burn pits and other harmful substances and their loved ones get access to the care and support they need.The veteran serving organization leaders shared their perspectives and priorities regarding the military to civilian transition, advancing equity, improving access to mental health care, reducing veteran suicide and homelessness, safeguarding veteran benefits, and ensuring access to world class care for veterans with severe disabilities.Administration Participants Included:###"
