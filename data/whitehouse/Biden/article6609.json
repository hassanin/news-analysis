    "content": "President Biden believes that as Americans, we have a sacred obligation to care for our nations’ veterans and their families – both while they are deployed and after they return home. The American Jobs Plan will help meet this obligation by creating millions of good jobs for veterans and their spouses, growing opportunities for small veteran-owned businesses, and helping ensure the delivery of world-class, state-of-the-art health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs.The American Jobs Plan addresses the consequences of disinvestment in American infrastructure, while also addressing long-standing racial injustice and confronting the climate crisis and the ambitions of an autocratic China. Like all Americans, veterans and their families will benefit from the historic investments in our transportation infrastructure, electric grid, drinking water systems, broadband access, and our care economy. The plan will make our cities and towns stronger, but also target investments in rural communities where roughly one quarter of our nation’s veterans and their families live.Specifically, President Biden’s American Jobs Plan will: Modernize Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities to deliver 21st century care More than 9 million veterans are enrolled in VA’s health care system, and as a result of their military service, many face significant health care needs. To meet these needs, VA operates the largest integrated health care system in the nation, with more than 1,700 hospitals, clinics and other health care facilities. The median age of U.S. private sector hospitals is 11 years; however, the median age of VA’s portfolio is 58 years, with 69% of VA hospitals over the age of 50. The age and condition of VA facilities demand that we do better by our nation’s veterans. That is why the American Jobs Plan includes $18 billion to modernize VA health care facilities. These investments will pay long-term dividends by offsetting growing costs of older facilities while meeting the health care needs of the veterans of yesterday’s wars, the veterans of today’s wars, and the veterans of the future. Specifically, President Biden’s American Jobs Plan will:  Create Quality Jobs for Veterans and their SpousesRoughly 200,000 service members transition from military service each year, the majority of whom will enter the civilian labor force. Many veterans have experienced unemployment and other economic challenges due to the pandemic. President Biden believes all veterans and their spouses deserve civilian lives of opportunity with education and jobs worthy of their skills and talents. As the veteran population grows increasingly diverse to include more women and veterans of color, addressing systemic racism and gender inequality will be particularly important. President Biden’s American Jobs Plan will:  Expand Opportunities for SMALL Veteran-Owned BusinessesVeterans are 45% more likely to be self-employed than non-veterans. The American Jobs Plan includes historic investments to empower all small businesses, including the more than 2.5 million veteran-owned small businesses.
