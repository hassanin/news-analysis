President Biden is monitoring developments and has directed USAID and other federal government partners to assess U.S. response options to help those most affected. The United States is proud to be the single largest donor of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, and our humanitarian partners are already delivering medical care and shelter supplies on the ground. We are committed to continuing our support for the needs of the Afghan people as we stand with them during and in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy.###"
