    "content": "Across the country, the electric grid connects 145 million households and businesses. But many parts of the nation’s grid are over a century old and in dire need of upgrades. Last year, the United States experienced 18 separate natural disasters that resulted in millions of American families losing power. These outages hurt the economy – the Department of Energy estimates that power outages cost American businesses $150 billion annually. Additionally, increased transmission is necessary to enable more clean energy that will reduce home energy costs and cut emissions.  Now more than ever, it is critical to invest in a clean, reliable electric grid – to ensure that communities don’t lose power when a major storm hits, to lower energy costs for hardworking families, and to achieve President Biden’s goal to deliver 100% clean electricity by 2035.That’s why President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, a key pillar of Bidenomics, is delivering the largest electric grid infrastructure investment in history – more than $30 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act. Through this historic investment in America’s electric grid, the Biden-Harris Administration is catalyzing development of thousands of miles of new and upgraded transmission lines that will reduce electricity costs for hardworking families and small businesses, prevent power outages in the face of extreme weather made worse by the climate crisis, strengthen America’s energy security, create good-paying jobs, and drive innovation and deployment of renewable energy technologies.As part of this unprecedented commitment, the Department of Energy today announced a new $1.3 billion commitment in three transmission lines crossing six states – Arizona, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Utah, and Vermont – to deliver affordable, reliable power to households across the country, creating more than 13,000 direct and indirect high-quality local jobs – many of them union jobs. Additionally, to ensure that transmission buildout is done efficiently, the Department of Energy today released the final National Transmission Needs Study, which provides insight into where the grid – and American communities – would benefit from increased transmission, by assessing current and anticipated future capacity constraints and congestion on the Nation’s electric grid.This announcement comes on the heels of the nearly $3.5 billion investmentannounced last week by the Department of Energy to strengthen grid reliability and resilience across 44 states, sparking a combined public-private investment of $8 billion, and bringing more than 35 gigawatts of new renewable energy online—enough to power about 30 million households. The 58 new projects supported by this investment will create and maintain good-paying and union jobs, including through labor partnerships with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. In addition, the Department of Energy has recently announced more than $748 million in formula funding to states, territories, and tribes through the Grid Resilience State and Tribal Formula Grants program to strengthen and modernize America’s power grid against wildfires, extreme weather, and other natural disasters that are exacerbated by the climate crisis.Through these investments, the Biden-Harris Administration is working to:Expand capacity and unlock renewable energy resources: Electrifying homes, buildings, and vehicles will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reducing costs.Reduce the frequency and duration of power outages: Investments in grid hardening—like strengthening critical transmission lines, hardening electric poles with stronger materials, and improving flood mitigation—will ensure that communities have power when natural disaster strikes and that power outages do not last long when they do occur. Recently announced investments will also support more than 400 microgrids, which can continue to operate if the main grid is affected by an extreme weather event.Mitigate risk of wildfire: By investing in projects that move overhead power lines that are threatened by high winds or heavy snow, removing hazard trees, and making technology-based upgrades and improvements, utilities can better predict when and where there are high-risk conditions for wildfires, better detect wildfires earlier on, and reduce the need to proactively shut off power in regions that are at-risk for wildfires.Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration is accelerating transmission by modernizing permitting, advancing next-generation planning, and more.
