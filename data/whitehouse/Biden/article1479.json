    "content": "National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with President Maia Sandu of Moldova. Mr. Sullivan expressed appreciation for Moldova’s generosity in welcoming individuals fleeing Russian aggression in neighboring Ukraine. He underscored the U.S. commitment to help Moldova and the region manage the effects of Russia’s brutal war, including $100 million announced earlier this month to help Moldova meet the needs of refugees as well as additional financial assistance to multilateral institutions supporting Moldova. He expressed strong support for President Sandu’s efforts to build a more democratic and prosperous county. He thanked her for sharing Moldova’s experience countering corruption at last year’s Summit for Democracy and noted continued U.S. support for these reform efforts, including through the recently announced European Democratic Resilience Initiative. Mr. Sullivan and President Sandu welcomed the opportunity to further strengthen bilateral cooperation at the U.S.-Moldova Strategic Dialogue, which will be held in Washington next week.###"
