    "content": "Biden will visit a manufacturer of clean energy technology in Fridley that is helping to build America’s clean energy economyOn Monday, April 3, President Biden will visit Cummins Power Generation Facility in Fridley, Minnesota as part of his Administration’s “Investing in America” tour. In October 2022, just two months after President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, Cummins announced that it will begin manufacturing electrolyzers in the United States for the first time. Electrolyzers help produce clean hydrogen that is essential for reducing emissions and creating good-paying jobs in manufacturing and industrial sectors, and play a critical role in clean energy supply chains that until now have largely been produced overseas.The visit will highlight how the President’s Investing in America agenda – including historic investments from the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the American Rescue Plan – is building a clean energy economy, rebuilding our infrastructure and bringing back supply chains, unleashing a manufacturing boom, and creating good-paying jobs across the country.Earlier this week, President Biden kicked off the Investing in America tour with a stop at a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina, and announced that since the beginning of his Administration, private companies have announced $435 billion in manufacturing investments in the United States. As part of the Investing in America tour, President Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady Jill Biden, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, members of the Cabinet, and senior White House officials are visiting over 20 states over the course of three weeks to highlight the impact of the President’s Investing in America agenda.Next week:As part of the Investing in America tour, the White House will also host an Energy Communities Summit on Tuesday, April 4th, to highlight how the President’s economic agenda is unleashing a manufacturing and clean energy boom, creating good-paying jobs, and bringing clean energy supply chains back to the United States. The Summit will include Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard, Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation John Podesta, and National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi.###"
