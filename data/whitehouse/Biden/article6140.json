    "content": "Fort Campbell, KYGood evening Ft. Campbell—It’s very special to be here with you.There are moments when we suddenly realize that history is being written in front of us—when we can almost feel ourselves cross the line that will divide our world into “before” and “after.”This is one of those moments. It’s tough to watch the news, isn’t it?I am here today to tell you that the President and I are so proud that you, the members of the 101st Airborne Division, are helping keep our promise to NATO.We are holding Putin accountable for his war through diplomacy with crippling sanctions.  We are providing Ukraine with economic, humanitarian, and security assistance.And the Screaming Eagles are there in Europe, standing with our allies and welcoming Ukrainian refugees.When you want it done, ask the 101!And as an Army mom, I know that you, their families, serve alongside them—loving, and encouraging, and praying for them, carrying a heavier share of the child care and home responsibilities, losing sleep while pride and hope and fear and frustration wrestle in your mind.You didn’t get months to prepare. You didn’t have time for a lengthy goodbye. In a moment, the plans you had made changed.But your families faced this challenge like you’ve faced all the others before it.Each of you put your shoulders back and your chin up.You answered the call of duty with grit and resilience, with constancy and courage.    I know that you are strong. There is no question about that.And I know that this community has a fierce bond. You look out for each other. You love each other.But I want you to know that you don’t have to carry the weight of this alone. It’s OK to ask for help. If you need someone to talk to, Military One Source has counseling and other mental health resources.And organizations like the Armed Services YMCA are here to support you with programs like child care and connections to community resources.Don’t hesitate to reach out.I also want you to know that Joining Forces—our White House initiative to support military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors—is working every day to get you the support you have earned.Because your commitment to this country never wavers. You deserve that same devotion.And I want you to know that your Commander in Chief thinks about each of you every day.Family is the love that grows in unexpected places.It’s the bonds we build through choice and chance—like the families you make with one another.Military families are our family.And we stand up for each other.We look out for each other.And we take care of our own.With all my heart: thank you for your sacrifice. God bless and protect our troops and their families.###"
