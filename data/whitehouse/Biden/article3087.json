    "content": "Today, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a decision that will undoubtedly restrict the right to vote, and in particular, for voters of color. After Shelby County v. Holder, this is the second time in the last eight years that the Supreme Court has dismantled crucial protections of the Voting Rights Act. As Justice Elena Kagan stated in her dissent today, the Voting Rights Act “represents the best of America,” while it “reminds us of the worst of America” because “it was—and remains—so necessary.” Almost 40 years ago, Congress worked across party lines to strengthen Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in response to an adverse Supreme Court decision. Now, Congress must act again. Our democracy depends on it."
