    "content": "As the President delivers results for the American people at home, he has also taken action to restore American leadership on the world stage—leading with America’s values, working in lockstep with America’s allies and partners, investing in the Nation’s military edge, and addressing the most significant challenges and opportunities before us. In the early years of what will be a decisive decade, America is better positioned than any Nation on earth to expand and preserve democratic values and prosperity in the 21st Century.  Under the President’s leadership, America has rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty against Russia’s brutal invasion. The Administration has reinvigorated crucial partnerships, fostered democracy and economic prosperity, advanced global health, furthered gender equality around the world, invested in our immigration system, and strengthened America’s military. The Budget builds on this progress through proposals to continue outcompeting China, confronting threats to global security and strengthening our military, and addressing pressing global challenges. Outcompetes China GloballyConfronts Threats to Global SecurityAddresses Pressing Global Challenges###"
