As a businessman, a Regent of the University of California, a philanthropist, and an advocate for human rights, Dick dedicated his life to furthering that vision. Our nation and our world are better for his work. Over the years, I always appreciated Dick’s compassion and boundless energy. Today, the Second Gentleman and I are holding Senator Feinstein and her family in our hearts and prayers.###"
