    "content": "President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda is Lowering Energy Costs, Improving Housing Quality for Hard-Working Families, and Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions for AmericansPresident Biden is focused on building a clean energy economy from the bottom up and middle out that helps hard-working families save money, protects public health, creates good-paying jobs and tackles the climate crisis. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to incorporate climate risk and mitigation into federally-supported housing. These steps will help American families save money on energy costs and keep their homes warm in the winter and cool in the summer, especially as communities across the country cope with climate-fueled extreme temperatures and volatile weather. These actions will also help tackle the climate crisis by lowering pollution from buildings. These steps will provide additional support for low- and moderate-income families, and complement tax credits that families and building owners can use under the Inflation Reduction Act to install energy-saving equipment and to make building upgrades. Today’s announcements make progress toward President Biden’s goal to retrofit four million buildings and two million homes during his first term.PROTECTING FAMILIES, LOWERING ENERGY COSTSMAKING HOMES MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT, SAVING FAMILIES MONEYMAKING SOLAR MORE AFFORDABLESAVING FAMILIES MONEY ON ENERGY COSTS AND EXPANDING HOUSING FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONSPROTECTING FAMILIES AGAINST FUTURE CLIMATE RISKSACCELERATING NET ZERO RETROFITSThese actions further the President’s Executive Order, Revitalizing Our Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All.  Reducing energy burden, cutting emissions, and improving climate resilience is crucial to communities that face disproportionate climate risks, such as flooding, fire and extreme temperature. The national average energy burden for low-income households is three times higher than for non-low-income households.Today’s announcements were made following last week’s convening at the White House with 24 states to highlight their efforts on commercial and residential building decarbonization policies and programs that lower utility bills, improve climate resilience, and reduce emissions.###"
