    "content": "FACT SHEET:Biden-Harris Administration will make federal procurement more economical and efficient by ensuring a stable, skilled, and experienced workforce for service contracts, even when contracts change handsToday, the President signed an Executive Order to ensure there will be a reliable supply of experienced and skilled employees working on federal service contracts. Service work supporting federal government functions occurs all over the country, from federal building maintenance to services provided on military bases to skilled technicians operating and maintaining federal equipment. Under this newly signed Executive Order, when a federal service contract transitions from one contractor to another, the new contractor will be required to offer jobs to qualified employees who worked for the previous contractor and performed their jobs well. This prevents disruptions in federal services, makes it easier for employers to find workers who are already trained for the job, and saves taxpayer dollars.This Executive Order is just one of many steps the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to improve the efficiency of federal procurement and make sure taxpayer dollars are used to strengthen good-quality, union jobs in America. Earlier this year, the President fulfilled his commitments to strengthen Buy American rules and to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 an hour. This Executive Order will support service sector workers and the work they do for the American people. The Executive Order builds on a policy set in E.O. 13495 during the Obama-Biden Administration.The Executive Order will benefit taxpayers, contractors and service contract workers by:###"
