The conference convened around 350 U.S., Ukrainian, and European industry and government representatives to focus on significantly increasing weapons production to support Ukraine’s fight for freedom against Russian aggression, and strengthen Ukraine’s long term self-defense.The U.S. and Ukrainian governments together seek to advance a robust and self-reliant Ukrainian defense industrial base that captures Ukraine’s innovative culture, provides materiel for urgent military needs, and contributes to Ukraine’s long-term security and economic success. Initial conference deliverables focused on first steps: institutionalizing relationships, processes, and dialogue between industry and government partners.These initial deliverables will not only expand U.S.-Ukraine cooperation and provide Ukraine with the capabilities it needs to be successful on the battlefield in the short-term, but will support Ukraine’s long-term economic recovery and defense."
