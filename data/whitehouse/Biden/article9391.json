Because of the ADA and its protections against discrimination in public accommodations, employment, transportation, and community living, millions of people with disabilities have grown up with the promise of the same rights and chances as their peers without disabilities — and our communities, our economy, and our country are all stronger as a result.Despite the important progress made under the ADA, many people with disabilities cannot access web or mobile-based state and local services—such as voter registration, filing taxes, applying for critical social services, accessing vital records, registering for vaccines, and taking online courses. This lack of accessibility has led unequal access to critical services for millions of Americans. As most services turned online during the pandemic, access disparities worsened. Deaf and hard of hearing people could not understand video messages from governors and mayors due to lack of captioning and American Sign Language interpretation. Community college students with certain disabilities, such as manual dexterity disabilities, could not properly navigate online course content.That’s why tomorrow, in recognition of the 33rd Anniversary of the ADA, the Biden-Harris administration is taking new steps to strengthen the ADA and improve online accessibility to state and local services for the nearly 50 million people with disabilities with vision, hearing, cognitive, and manual dexterity disabilities.New Biden-Harris administration Rule to Improve Online Accessibility:The Department of Justice (DOJ) is proposing a new rule that would establish accessibility standards for state and local governments’ web and mobile app-based services. This proposed rule will better enable state and local governments to meet their ADA obligation to provide equal access to their services, programs, and activities for people with disabilities. The proposed rule suggests clear technical standards, like including text descriptions of images so people using screen readers can understand the content, providing captions on videos, and enabling navigation through use of a keyboard instead of a mouse for those with limited use of their hands. Clearer standards will both ensure that people with disabilities can access vital services and make it easier for states and localities to understand their ADA obligations.The proposed rule will move us toward a more inclusive nation through equal access to crucial state and local services. It will help ensure that students with disabilities can access course content for the courses they enroll in, including higher level math and science. It will improve voter registration websites so that voters with disabilities can register independently. And it will help people with disabilities commute to work by helping them access bus and train information online.Previous Administration Actions to Support People with DisabilitiesTomorrow’s announcement follows a series of historic investments through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act to strengthen accessible infrastructure, provide affordable internet, expand access to health care, and increase access to educational and job opportunities for Americans with disabilities. And it builds upon the Administration’s broader agenda to achieve a more inclusive, accessible, and equitable country for people with disabilities. In the past year, the Administration has been:###"
