    "content": "Small businesses are the backbone of the economy – employing half of all private sector workers and growing our economy from the middle-out and bottom-up in every corner of the United States, including in Indian Country. Tribal communities and Native-owned small businesses, however, were disproportionately hard hit by the pandemic, including a roughly 40% decline in the number of Native-owned small businesses in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic.1Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing approval of the first 15 Tribal State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) awards for tribal governments funded by the American Rescue Plan, providing $73 million to 39 Tribal Governments to support Tribal enterprises and small business owners, as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda. These are the first-ever SSBCI awards directly to Tribal Governments. The announcement coincides with the launch of the second round of President Biden’s Investing in America tour, where President Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady Jill Biden, and leaders across the Administration will fan out across the country over the course of three weeks to highlight manufacturing, infrastructure, and cost-saving investments in communities across the country driven by President Biden’s economic agenda.For the first time ever, President Biden’s American Rescue Plan (ARP) included more than $500 million in SSBCI support that has been set aside for, and applied for, by Tribal Governments. This is the first ever inclusion of dedicated, direct support to Tribal Governments in the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) program to help enable investments in Tribal enterprises and small businesses. Investments like SSBCI will help to ensure that all Americans—including in historically underserved Tribal communities—will benefit from the record small business growth happening under President Biden’s leadership. The SSBCI awards announced today will not only benefit Tribal communities and Native entrepreneurs but will also create critical jobs and economic opportunities for workers and businesses in surrounding areas. The ARP’s historic reauthorization and expansion of SSBCI—a more than 6-fold increase from the program’s original 2010 allocation—is expected to support 100,000 small businesses and result in tens of billions of dollars in new small business financing nationwide over the course of the decade.“Small businesses are the backbone of our nation’s economy. Our Administration has taken action to expand access to capital for all entrepreneurs and small business owners so they can expand, grow and thrive in the communities they serve.” said Vice President Harris. “Far too often, entrepreneurs and small business owners with big plans and a vision for the future struggle simply because they lack the capital or financial services they need. That is why we are making this historic investment, which will help Tribal communities grow their small businesses, create jobs, and strengthen our economy. President Biden and I will continue to fight to make sure that all communities have the resources they need to thrive.”First-Ever State Small Business Credit Initiative Tribal awards highlighted today include:For a full list of approved SSBCI awards to Tribes, click here.Today’s announcement builds upon the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic support for recovery, expanded economic opportunity, and better access to capital for Native people and Tribal communities, including:While challenges remain to ensure that all Tribal communities can achieve prosperity and resilience, the Biden-Harris Administration’s investments in Indian Country are working to help ensure a robust recovery and a more promising economic future:[1] Calculations by Robert Fairlie, Professor of Policy and Economics, UCLA based on Current Population Survey data.###"
