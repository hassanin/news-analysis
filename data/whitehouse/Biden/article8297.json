The President and First Lady will affirm that our entire nation stands with Hawaii in this time of grief and recovery.As the recovery moves into the next phase, President Biden, alongside FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, will announce that he is appointing FEMA Region 9 Administrator Bob Fenton as the Federal government’s “Chief Federal Response Coordinator” for Maui. Mr. Fenton is one of the nation’s most experienced disaster response-and-recovery officials who has been on the ground in Hawaii from the day the wildfires started. In this role, Fenton will oversee the Federal government’s long-term recovery work on the ground for Maui. President Biden is directing Chief Federal Response Coordinator Fenton to ensure that every Federal asset is provided to help the community rebuild as fast as possible in Maui.Since the onset of this unprecedented tragedy, President Biden launched a whole-of-government effort to support residents and affected communities – and as soon as Hawaii Governor Josh Green requested a Major Disaster Declaration, the President signed it. Dozens of Federal departments and agencies continue working with state and local partners on the ground to assess ongoing needs and provide resources and personnel to support response efforts.Below are updated statistics and actions from the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole of government response, including a new U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) announcement of the immediate availability of $3 million, the full amount of “quick release” Emergency Relief (ER) funds requested by the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT), to offset costs associated with traffic management services and repairs to infrastructure needed as a result of damage caused by wildfires.The Administration encourages individuals impacted by the disaster to register for Federal assistance at www.disasterassistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-3362 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week).Impacted individuals can also visit FEMA’s newly opened joint Disaster Recovery Center at the University of Hawaii Maui College, located at 310 W. Ka’ahumanu Avenue, Kahului, Hawaii, to speak personally with FEMA specialists, get assistance registering for disaster assistance, get in touch with voluntary organizations offering additional support services, and have access to other federal and state resources.  The doors are open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. HST seven days a week.Here is an update on the Biden-Harris Administration’s coordinated federal response:###"
