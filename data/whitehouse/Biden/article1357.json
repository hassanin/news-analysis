    "content": "Yesterday, President Biden announced a plan to expand health coverage for DACA recipients. If finalized, the rule would allow DACA recipients to enroll in Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Programs, and the Affordable Care Act’s Health Insurance Marketplaces, where they may qualify for financial assistance based on income, and through their state Medicaid agency. President Biden believes that DACA recipients strengthen our economy and enrich our workplaces, our schools and communities, and our country as a whole. That’s why on his first day in office, he called on Congress to give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship and he has repeated that call in every State of the Union address since. While Congress has failed to act, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken significant measures to protect Dreamers.  See below for what they are saying:Congressional LeadersSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer: “Dreamers deserve access to health coverage in the only country they call home. I applaud President Biden for this highly impactful policy change that will improve the lives of so many!” [Tweet, 4/13/23]Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin: “DACA holders are American in every way but their paperwork and are an important part of our nation & our economy. Extending ACA health insurance options to them is humane and simply common sense. Congress’ decades long failure to do the right thing for Dreamers is inexcusable.” [Tweet, 4/13/23]  Senator Bob Menendez: “I’m glad to see the Biden Administration taking steps to recognize that DACA recipients have been waiting for over decade for Republicans to come to the table to give them a path to citizenship.” [Tweet, 4/13/23] Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi: “Our Dreamers enrich their communities and make America more American. As Democrats fight for a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, we commend President Biden for ensuring their access to quality, affordable health care.” [Tweet, 4/13/23]Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar: “The @HispanicCaucus has long fought for this, and today, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking a life-changing step forward for DACA recipients, who deserve access to good health care in the only country they call home.” [Tweet, 4/13/23] Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair and California U.S. Rep. Nanette Barragan: “Thank you @POTUS for listening, hearing us, & delivering! And thank you to the DACA recipients & advocates who have fought for years to simply have access to the healthcare they deserve. A huge step forward for our communities!” [Tweet, 4/13/23] Congressional Hispanic Caucus: “Today, we applaud President Biden’s decision to provide more equitable access to health care to hundreds-of-thousands of Latinos in our communities and throughout the country. This decision also marks a significant accomplishment for the CHC. This change in policy has been a priority for the CHC and we have pushed multiple Administrations to provide access to quality, affordable, health care for DACA recipients. This morning, the hard work of the CHC, our members, and DACA recipients and advocates has paid off. The change CHC fought for is finally underway. As a result of this change, approximately 600,000 DACA recipients and their U.S. citizen children will be able to secure and purchase health insurance through the ACA. Access to ACA and Medicaid benefits will allow a significant number of Latinos to improve their quality of life, obtain affordable, quality health care, and make way for a healthier future for our communities. We thank the Biden-Harris Administration for their commitment to Latino communities who have historically been disadvantaged when it comes to accessing health care. We also ask the Department of Health and Human Services to act with urgency and implement the changes as soon as possible so that DACA recipients can quickly access the benefits that – as taxpayers – they have earned.” [Statement, 4/13/23]Senator Michael Bennet: “I applaud the Biden administration’s plan to expand health coverage for DACA recipients. For many Dreamers, America is the only country they know as home. They deserve the same opportunities and support as everyone else.” [Tweet, 4/13/23]Senator Cory Booker: “Expanding health care coverage to DACA Recipients is the right thing to do.

For many DACA recipients, America is the only home they’ve ever known – and I will always stand up to support and protect them.” [Tweet, 4/13/23] Senator Jacky Rosen: “Dreamers are vital members of our community, and they deserve the same access to affordable, quality health care as everyone else.

It’s what Dreamers deserve!” [Tweet, 4/13/23]Rep. Emanuel Cleaver: “All of our neighbors deserve affordable healthcare, including Dreamers who contribute so much to our communities.

Adriano Espaillat: “I commend @POTUS for expanding health coverage for DACA recipients. Dreamers are integral to our communities and economy. We must ensure they are able to live healthy and enriched lives as they continue to make our communities and nation a more vibrant place for all.” [Tweet, 4/13/23] Rep. Ruben Gallego: “Last year, I pushed the Biden Admin. to make ACA, Medicaid, and CHIP accessible to DACA recipients who have been unfairly excluded.

Health care should be a right, not a privilege.” [Tweet, 4/13/23] Rep.

Having good reliable health care is a human need, and this rule change will mean that more people will have the life saving health care coverage they need to take care of themselves and their families. We all contribute to the health care programs so it was unconscionable that DACA recipients were barred from eligibility for ACA, Medicaid and other government subsidized health care. We celebrate President Biden and the Department of Health and Human Services for heeding our demands to remove this cruel and unnecessary bar on eligibility for hundreds of thousands of young people…” [Statement, 4/13/23]Justice Action Center: “For too many DACA recipients, affordable health care has been out of reach.

Though DACA recipients like me currently lack a pathway to citizenship, we work and serve our communities, paying state and federal taxes like everyone else and we are no less vulnerable than anyone else to health problems. Granting DACA recipients access to healthcare will no doubt save lives as it will also help stabilize millions who can now rest easy knowing that they can see a doctor when they need to.

I, alongside the American Immigration Council, would like to thank and applaud the Biden Administration today for this expansion of the Affordable Care Act. Immigration status should not be a barrier to healthcare access, and today’s announcement fills a void for DACA beneficiaries like myself, who were previously excluded from the ACA. This new expansion let’s immigrants who have contributed to our healthcare system, from small business owners, to students, to stay-at-home parents, obtain essential medical care. As I know firsthand, the DACA community has often been left out in the past. Thankfully, this new ACA expansion is a great step toward equitable access to services for immigrants. It will now be easier for the DACA community to receive medical care without having to worry about being able to put food on the table. Dreamers are crucial members of our workforce, and our communities and Congress should act and finally do what is right and pass legislation to provide them with a path to citizenship.Today, the Biden Administration has unveiled a plan to expand access to Affordable Care Act and Medicaid coverage for #DACA recipients. The American Immigration Council applauds these efforts and has issued the following response.”[Tweet, 4/13/23] ACLU: “We commend President Biden for this important step in ensuring DACA recipients are treated with fairness and dignity.
