Fraud against veterans and service members is widespread. From 2015-2019, the Federal Trade Commission received 163,000 fraud reports from veterans and nearly 13,000 from active-duty service members. Furthermore, veterans face particularly high risks for fraud with the median loss for veterans from fraud 44% higher than other civilians. In November, as part of his Unity Agenda for the nation, President Biden launched the VSAFE campaign and task force to combat fraud and scams perpetrated against veterans, service members, and their families. His announcement included a set of actions the Task Force will tackle including releasing a fraud prevention tool kit and creating a one-stop shop for resources and reporting tools.  At the meeting, Administration officials spoke to the actions their agencies are currently taking to address fraud against veterans and service members, as well as outlined next steps towards implementing the “no wrong door” approach.Participants also agreed on new actions to implement the President’s vision of a “no wrong door” approach for veterans and service members to access resources and reporting tools to address fraud. Specifically, agency leaders agreed to collaboratively draft shared call scripts, training, and procedures for call center staff regarding fraud response routing and information to improve the veteran experience in the short term. Furthermore, the White House will convene an interagency working group to evaluate options to implement the no wrong door approach and report back to task force leadership by the end of the first quarter of 2024.These actions build on Biden-Harris Administration’s work to support veterans, service members, their families, caregivers and survivors . In August 2022, President Biden signed the PACT Act, the most significant expansion of benefits and services for toxic exposed veterans in more than 30 years to strengthen health care benefits to veterans and survivors. VA has been committed to supporting veterans by delivering more benefits and services than ever before, this includes expanding eligibility for low-or no-cost health care to all living World War II veterans, awarding $105 million in grants for community-based organizations to deliver and coordinate suicide prevention programs, and issuing $1 billion in funding to community organizations to support housing, transitional housing, and case management for veterans experiencing and at risk of experiencing homelessness. President Biden has also taken executive action to support veterans, signing executive orders to strengthen the economic security of military and veteran spouses and survivors and to increase access to quality child-care and long-term care of Americans, including for veterans.The discussion included the following participants:###"
