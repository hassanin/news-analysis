The meeting advances President Biden’s goal of modernizing and upgrading the nation’s residential and commercial buildings to be affordable, resilient, accessible, energy efficient, and electrified.In his first 100 days in office, President Biden took sweeping steps to build a new American infrastructure and clean energy economy that will create millions of new jobs. The President issued an Executive Order announcing bold targets to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and put the United States on an irreversible path to a net-zero economy by 2050. And the Department of Energy rebooted the efficiency standards program to save consumers money through energy efficient appliances and equipment. The President recognizes the opportunity that retrofitting and modernizing our nation’s existing buildings presents, which is why his American Jobs Plan American Jobs Plan promises to build, rehabilitate, and retrofit more than two million homes across the country while also improving our nation’s federal facilities. This effort will create new domestic manufacturing opportunities for electric heating and cooling technology, invest in research and development to spur smart building advances, and forge collaborations that will enable buildings to be powered by clean electricity.Additionally, independent analysts at the Coalition for Green Capital and Rewiring America issued a report today that shows how the Clean Energy Accelerator proposed in the American Jobs Plan could be used to drive an electrification program to secure energy bill savings of up to $750 per year for nearly 12 million American households (75 percent of which are low- to moderate-income). At the same time, the report found that the program, working through the Accelerator, could create nearly 700,000 good-paying, local jobs in every region in the country, while also driving down greenhouse gas emissions from households by up to 40 million metric tons a year by 2030, which is the equivalent of taking more than eight million cars off the road. The report also estimates that advancing the Clean Energy Accelerator could catalyze tens of billions in private sector co-investment through this program, and that 90% of investment delivered through the proposal would directly benefit low-to moderate-income households.  The findings of this report underscore the importance of today’s announcements from the White House addressing a series of concrete actions to modernize and electrify our buildings, invest in America’s workforce, and drive innovations of the future.Investing in America’s Workforce and Creating JobsLaunching New Federal Performance Standards to Lead by ExampleEstablishing New Partnerships to Kickstart Demand for High-Performance BuildingsThe Biden Administration is dedicated to working with the private sector, labor unions, building and home owners, and manufacturers in the building industry to electrify and modernize new and existing buildings. Additionally, the Administration will support city, state, and tribal governments through expanded partnerships to develop new tools and resources to make buildings more energy efficient, affordable, and healthy. These partnerships will include:Accelerating Domestic Manufacturing, Innovation, and Affordability of New and Existing Buildings###"
