Special Presidential Advisor Chris Dodd recently met with President Lasso and delivered President Biden’s invitation to meet at the White House. The visit provides an opportunity for the Presidents to consult on a range of regional and global issues, including Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war in Ukraine. During the meeting, the leaders also plan to underscore the importance of strengthening democratic institutions and discuss regional economic integration initiatives, including the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, economic and security cooperation, and Ecuador’s leadership on regional migration.###"
