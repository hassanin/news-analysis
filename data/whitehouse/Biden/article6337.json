FOSTER OPENNESS AND OPEN SOCIETIES  The United States has an abiding interest in ensuring the region remains open and accessible to all and that governments and publics are able to make their own political choices, consistent with international obligations.  Open societies are generally more inclined to work in common cause with the United States, attract greater U.S. trade and investment, pursue policies to improve conditions for their citizens, and counter harmful activities by the People’s Republic of China, Russia, and other actors.  We will foster openness and open societies, including by:2. DELIVER DEMOCRATIC AND SECURITY DIVIDENDSThe region’s commitment and capacity to renew its democracies, as well as anticipate, prevent, and address emerging and long running conflicts, can lead to more favorable outcomes for Africans and Americans.  By simultaneously addressing these challenges and reaffirming that democracy delivers tangible benefits, the United States can offer positive choices to Africans as they determine their own future.  We will help Africa deliver democratic and security dividends, including by:3. ADVANCE PANDEMIC RECOVERY AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITYIt is essential to address two of the region’s most pressing problems: the COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant economic and social consequences.  These challenges have been compounded by supply chain problems and food insecurity stemming from Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine.  The United States is committed to working with regional governments and international partners to build more stable and inclusive African economies.  We will advance pandemic recovery and economic opportunity, including by:4. SUPPORT CONSERVATION, CLIMATE ADAPTATION, AND A JUST ENERGY TRANSITIONAfrica’s efforts to conserve and restore the continent’s ecosystems and rich natural resources— while also realizing energy access and energy security goals, diversifying its energy mix, and building sustainable supply chains—are central to tackling the global climate crisis.  Although the region is responsible for extremely low emissions per capita, it stands to suffer from some of the most severe effects of climate change.  We will support conservation, climate adaptation, and a just energy transition, including by:"
