    "content": "On Tuesday, senior Administration officials convened the CEOs of the three principal companies that together manufacture RSV immunizations for infants, including Sanofi, AstraZeneca, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. In the meeting, senior Administration officials once again stressed the importance of working with urgency to meet demand and increase availability of RSV immunizations for infants through the commercial market this viral season. The call follows several engagements with manufacturers on increasing the availability of RSV immunizations for infants. Following these conversations, last week RSV immunization manufacturers confirmed that 230,000 additional doses of RSV immunizations for infants would be made available in January, on top of the 77,000 additional doses which were released in November. Senior Administration officials and manufacturer CEOs also agreed on the importance of continued communication during manufacturers’ planning for the next 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.###"
