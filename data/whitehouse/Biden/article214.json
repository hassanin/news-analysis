    "content": "Black Americans with disabilities are deserving of dignity, respect, and equal opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Black History Month celebrates the resilience and talents of Black people, including Black disabled people. This country was founded upon the idea that all people are created equal and should be treated equally. However, it is important to acknowledge that racism and ableism together are longstanding barriers to the full participation and independence of Black people with disabilities. America has made significant progress, but there is more work to do to become an inclusive, accessible, and equitable nation.From the outset, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic action to advance equity through Executive Orders, administrative actions, and the provision of funding and resources. Across the whole of the federal government, agencies are examining their policies and programs for disparities that have made it difficult for Black Americans and people with disabilities to thrive in their communities – at work, at school, and at home. The Administration has delivered real change and will continue to work towards equitable outcomes and opportunities for Black disabled Americans.###"
