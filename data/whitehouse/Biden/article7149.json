    "content": "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., met today with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty and democracy against Russia’s invasion. President Biden underscored U.S. readiness to continue delivering security assistance to meet Ukraine’s immediate battlefield needs, including today’s announcement of an additional $375 million in ammunition and equipment, as well as to build Ukraine’s long term capacity to defend against and deter Russian aggression. To that end, the leaders discussed U.S. support for a joint effort, with our allies and partners, to train Ukrainian pilots on fourth-generation fighter aircraft, like the F-16. They also discussed ongoing efforts to further strengthen Ukraine’s air defenses as Russia continues its missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities. In addition, President Biden underscored the support of the United States and other G7 nations for Ukraine’s reconstruction, including efforts to rebuild its energy infrastructure, and Ukraine’s implementation of reforms needed to fulfil its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. President Biden also welcomed President Zelenskyy’s commitment to a just peace based on fundamental principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.###"
