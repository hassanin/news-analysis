It will live on WhiteHouse.gov/VirtualTour, as well as on both Google Maps and the Google Arts & Culture page. “Since day one of this Administration, the First Lady has worked to open the doors of the White House wider and wider, using technology and digital platforms to bring the “People’s House” to as many people as possible.  Not everyone can make the trip to Washington, DC to tour the White House, so she is bringing the White House to them.  We especially hope teachers everywhere can use this in their classrooms as a new interactive tool to educate their students about the White House – both past and present,” said Elizabeth Alexander, Communications Director for the First Lady. This is the first Google virtual tour of the White House with available Spanish translation and audio captions for those with disabilities.  Audio captions were narrated by White House Social Secretary Carlos Elizondo. The opening video on the virtual tour of the President and the First Lady is the same video that plays at the White House Visitors Center, so those who come for the virtual tour will get the same experience and message as those who come in-person. ###"
