In both countries Dr. Gordon and the delegation will discuss bilateral cooperation and emphasize the importance of strengthening democracy, rule of law, and good governance to promote prosperity in the region.Dr. Gordon and the delegation will highlight the Vice President’s continued leadership implementing the Biden-Harris Administration’s Root Causes Strategy—a core component of the Administration’s efforts to address the root causes of migration from northern Central America, including through improving civilian security, good governance, human rights and labor protections, countering gender-based violence, and expanding economic opportunity. They will also advance work on Central America Forward, the public-private partnership that has generated more than $4.2 billion in private sector investments, thanks to the Vice President’s leadership. Dr. Gordon and the delegation will meet with existing private sector partners – and prospective partners – to mobilize further support, view the impact of existing investments, and discuss ways to create economic opportunities and good jobs in the region.The delegation will also highlight U.S. assistance to northern Central America to advance the Root Causes Strategy and lawful labor pathways.  Under this Strategy, the United States provided over $1 billion in FY 2022, including nearly $800 million in economic, development, and security assistance. These funds are a part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to work with Congress to provide $4 billion over four years to address the root causes of migration and help the people of the region create safer, more stable futures in their home communities. ###"
