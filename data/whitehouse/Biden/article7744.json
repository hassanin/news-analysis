    "content": "Access to high-speed internet is no longer a luxury – it is a necessity to fully participate in today’s society. Still, many students and families go without high-speed internet because of the cost, while others are forced to cut back on other essentials to pay their monthly internet bill. That’s why President Biden and Vice President Harris worked with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to include the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)—the largest internet affordability program in our nation’s history—in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Affordable Connectivity Program, administered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), provides eligible households up to $30/month (or up to $75/month on qualifying Tribal lands) off internet bills, as well as a one-time discount of up to $100 off a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet. To further lower costs, President Biden and Vice President Harris secured commitments from internet service providers across the country to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program—meaning millions of working families can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. Americans can check their eligibility and sign-up at GetInternet.gov.Today, the Administration announced that Civic Nation and the U.S. Department of Education are launching Online For All, a digital equity campaign working to close the digital divide by focusing on internet access, affordability, and equity for students, families, and all Americans. Online For All will work with nonprofit, government, corporate, and media stakeholders to educate communities about how the Biden-Harris Internet for All Initiative can help them access reliable, affordable high-speed internet.The partnership is kicking off with a Week of Action to drive enrollment in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Over 18.5 million households are now enrolled, saving a total of over $500 million per month on their high-speed internet bills. This is incredible progress for a program that is just 18 months old, but there’s more work to do. Research indicates that approximately half of the remaining qualified Americans are not aware of the program. The Online for All Week of Action will bring together the federal government and over 300 organizations to raise awareness and help eligible families sign-up.AN “ALL OF GOVERNMENT” EFFORTThe Biden-Harris Administration is committed to continuing to reach qualified Americans and seeing this program continue for years to come. The Administration previously launched an “all of government” ACP enrollment drive. Now, the Administration is taking additional actions to reach eligible Americans, including: And Administration officials are hitting the road to spread the word. Today’s events include:A NATION COMING TOGETHER TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDEOver 300 organizations from across the nation are taking action this week as part of the Online For All Week of Action. These efforts will help thousands of new households enroll and drive awareness about how the Affordable Connectivity Program is essential to close the digital divide. Activities include: To see a full list of organizations participating in the Online For All Week of Action, or if your organization is interested in participating in the Online for All Week of Action, please go to OnlineForAll.org/Week-of-Action/.Connecting all communities across the United States to affordable high-speed internet is a central part of President Biden’s and Vice President Harris’ Investing in America agenda, which is rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure, driving new private sector manufacturing investments, and creating good-paying jobs, including those that don’t require a four-year degree—rebuilding our economy from the bottom up and middle out. That investment includes Monday’s announcement of more than $700 million across 19 states through the ReConnect Program to fund affordable high-speed internet deployment in rural America. And by June 30, the Department of Commerce will announce state and territory allocations for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, which will also require service providers receiving funding to offer a low-cost plan and to participate in the Affordable Connectivity Program.###"
