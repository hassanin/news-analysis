    "content": "As we’ve seen throughout our history, when the U.S. government invests in innovation, we can achieve breakthroughs that would otherwise be impossible, and save and improve lives on a vast scale. Today, FDA announced a major breakthrough for the 100,000 Americans who live with sickle cell disease. Living with sickle cell often has meant putting the goals and plans of everyday life on hold because of the chronic pain and serious health complications associated with it. And although this disease impacts people of all backgrounds, it disproportionally affects Black and Hispanic Americans. My Administration has worked tirelessly to close these health disparities and help deliver care for sickle cell disease patients and their families, and we will continue to do so. This announcement also represents the power of medical innovation to improve Americans’ lives. This significant medical advancement holds tremendous promise for developing additional life-saving treatments and it gives hope to the millions of Americans who live with other rare diseases. My Administration will continue our efforts to accelerate the development of cures for rare diseases and support the medical research and innovation that achieved this breakthrough."
