Since then, more than 17 Federal agencies, through 35 High Impact Service Providers (HISPs), have taken actions to deliver customer experiences that are more simple, seamless, and secure. The President’s Budget builds on this work by proposing more than $500 million to modernize services, reduce administrative burdens, pilot new online tools and technologies, and improve agency capacity to improve service delivery. By centering the customer’s experience with Federal services, these investments bring value to Americans’ everyday interactions with the Federal government.Specifically, the President’s Budget:MODERNIZES SERVICE DELIVERY IN KEY AREASADVANCES LIFE EXPERIENCE PILOT PROJECTSEXPANDS AND STANDS UP DEPARTMENTAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE OFFERS###"
