    "content": "As appropriate given the independence of the Justice Department in specific criminal cases, no one at the White House was aware of the gag order until Friday night. While the White House does not intervene in criminal investigations, the issuing of subpoenas for the records of reporters in leak investigations is not consistent with the Presidentâ€™s policy direction to the Department, and the Department of Justice has reconfirmed it will not be used moving forward.###"
