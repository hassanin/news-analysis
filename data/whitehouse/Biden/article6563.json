The Vice President will convene leaders across the federal government – including agencies that may not have historically taken a leading role addressing the maternal health crisis. In December 2021, Vice President Harris convened the first-ever federal Maternal Health Day of Action, where she announced a historic Call to Action to improve health outcomes for parents and infants in the United States. This resulted in the Administration’s announcement of private sector and public sector investments. Ahead of the meeting with Cabinet officials, the Administration is following up with additional actions to address maternal health, and to combat the systemic inequities that lead to worse maternal outcomes for Black, Native American, and rural women. New Announcements:Previous Actions Announced since the Vice President’s Call to Action in DecemberAdditional BackgroundShe introduced several bills in the Senate specifically targeted to addressing racial disparities in maternal mortality, including the Maternal CARE Act and the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act.###"
