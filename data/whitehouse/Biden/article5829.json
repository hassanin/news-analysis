After his public remarks, President Biden joined Jeff Zients, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Walensky to answer questions from several of the nation’s governors. The group discussed a range of topics, including the latest science on the Omicron variant, the use and distribution of COVID-19 treatments, expanding Federal partnerships and resources on testing, and keeping the Nation’s schools open. President Biden concluded the call by reiterating his gratitude to NGA Chairman Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and NGA Vice Chairman Phil Murphy of New Jersey for their bipartisan leadership on the COVID-19 response, and that his Administration stands ready to provide any additional resources needed by the states.###"
