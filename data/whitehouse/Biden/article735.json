As part of his plan to cut costs for Americans and give families more breathing room, the President’s Budget cuts taxes for working people and families with children by almost $800 billion over the next 10 years. Like the rest of the Budget’s investments, these tax cuts are more than paid for by ensuring wealthy people and large corporations pay their fair share in taxes and by cutting spending on special interests, without raising taxes on anyone with income below $400,000 per year.Congressional Republicans have instead offered a set of top-down tax proposals. Their agenda would add over $3 trillion to the debt with tax cuts and other giveaways skewed to the wealthy and large corporations. Remarkably, even as they have put forward trillions in tax cuts, they have also advanced proposals that would raise taxes on millions of middle-class and working Americans. And now, MAGA Republicans are demanding massive cuts to programs middle-class and working families, seniors, and students rely on — from public safety to health care to education — while reportedly declining to put forward a budget, which would show how much of these cuts are going to pay for their tax cuts, rather than reduce the debt.Who would see a tax cut?Under the President’s Plan: Families with Children, Working Households, People Buying Health Insurance, and Families Adopting a ChildUnder Congressional Republican Proposals: Huge Corporations, Multi-Millionaires, Wealthy Tax CheatsWho would pay more?Under the President’s Plan: Billionaires Who Now Pay Virtually Nothing, Huge Corporations Sheltering Income in Tax Havens, and Businesses Splurging on Stock BuybacksUnder the President’s plan, there are no tax increases at all for anyone making less than $400,000 per year. But taxes would go up for:Under Congressional Republican Proposals: Middle Class and Working Families and Seniors###"
