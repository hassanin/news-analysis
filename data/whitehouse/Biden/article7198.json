Biden, Jr. spoke today with His Majesty Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, the Sultan of Oman.  The two leaders discussed the latest developments in Gaza and the importance of sustained humanitarian access and the importance of protecting civilians, consistent with international humanitarian law, as Israel responds to Hamas’s heinous terrorist attack on October 7.  They emphasized the importance of deterring threats from any state or non-state actor seeking to expand the conflict and of working towards a durable and sustained peace in the Middle East, to include the establishment of a Palestinian state.  President Biden reaffirmed the enduring ties between the United States and Oman and thanked Sultan Haitham for his personal leadership and support for the UN-mediated truce in Yemen.  Both leaders committed to strengthening the longstanding U.S.-Oman bilateral relationship and seeking new opportunities in trade and investment, security coordination, and cooperation towards a more prosperous Middle East region. ###"
