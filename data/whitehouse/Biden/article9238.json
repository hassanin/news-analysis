At the same time, additional resources are needed to meet the needs of the American people, support our communities, and protect our nation and its interests. The Administration continues to call on Congress to reach a comprehensive, bipartisan agreement to fund the Government, which is critical for a number of bipartisan priorities – including child care, nutrition assistance, public health, research and development, and national security. The Administration also recently communicated with Congress about critical funding needs for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), the Student Aid Administration, and the Social Security Administration to prevent harmful impacts on women and children, students, seniors and individuals with disabilities in the coming year, and we expect Congress to address these needs as well as today’s supplemental funding request. In the meantime, in order to advance critical domestic priorities and address urgent needs, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to provide additional domestic resources that will:Support Communities Facing Extreme Weather and Climate DisastersAs the President has said repeatedly, the Administration will stand with communities as they recover from extreme weather and climate disasters for as long as it takes. The Administration’s request is based on current estimates of need in communities affected by recent disasters, and the Administration will work with Congress to continue to assess these needs to fully support recovery and rebuilding. To meet our commitment to communities facing flooding, extreme heat, catastrophic wildfires, drought, and other severe weather events over the past year, the Administration is requesting:Prevent Families from Losing Child CareThe American Rescue Plan provided the largest one-time investment the country has ever made in child care, bringing vital relief to the child care sector, which was already on the brink of crisis prior to the pandemic. These resources enabled all 50 states and D.C. to make payments to over 220,000 child care providers, serving as many as 10 million children, that were at risk of closing—supporting the creation of more child care slots across the country, reducing family child care costs, increasing compensation to recruit and retain staff, and helping parents, especially mothers, return to work or enter the workforce.Without congressional action, the expiration of child care stabilization funding at the end of September threatens to undo recent gains and destabilize the child care sector. There are already reports of providers needing to raise parent fees to help cover operating costs that were subsidized by child care stabilization funding, or reduce staff wages, exacerbating challenges in hiring and retaining qualified staff. Some providers may be forced to close without additional resources. If this trajectory continues, hardworking families will pay the price—parents will be left with fewer child care options higher costs—preventing parents from working and holding back our entire economy. Addressing this challenge requires congressional action and dedicated resources in addition to the existing Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), which provides child care subsidies to low-income families. As Congress works to reach an agreement on full-year CCDBG appropriations, the Administration is also requesting an additional year of child care stabilization funding to help keep child care providers afloat, mitigating the likelihood that providers will close or raise costs for families.Continue to Expand Access to High-Speed Internet Across AmericaIn the 21st century, affordable, reliable high-speed internet is a necessity for Americans to do their jobs, participate equally in school learning, access health care, and stay connected. But too often, high costs create a barrier and tens of millions of families, students, and seniors are left without access to high-speed internet, or have to sacrifice other necessities to pay their internet bill, exacerbating underlying inequities. The Affordable Connectivity Program, enacted under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is already helping over 21 million households save over $500 million per month on their monthly internet bills. The program is also critical for the Administration’s high-speed internet deployment programs for rural, remote, and Tribal communities. Without this funding, tens of millions of people would lose this benefit and would no longer be able to afford high-speed internet service without sacrificing other necessities. The Administration is requesting additional funds to strengthen the program by extending free and discounted high-speed internet for eligible households through December 2024.Protect American Security and Bolster Energy IndependenceAlongside the Administration’s request for funding to address the challenges we face abroad, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to provide supplemental funding to strengthen our security at home, including by protecting communities at high-risk of attack, safeguarding our communications infrastructure, and strengthening our energy independence. The requested funding will:Save Lives by Countering the Fentanyl CrisisThanks to historic funding and bipartisan efforts, the rate of overdose deaths is slowing after a period of exponential increase, access to treatment is expanding, and historic amounts of fentanyl are being seized at our borders. But our work to beat the overdose epidemic is far from over and additional resources are needed to continue the Administration’s aggressive action to save lives. As part of the Administration’s National Drug Control Strategy supported by the National Security Supplemental package released last week to crack down on the trafficking of illicit fentanyl, the Administration’s Domestic Supplemental request includes funding for grants to States, Territories and Tribes through the Department of Health and Human Services’ State Opioid Response (SOR) grant program. This critical program provides funding for opioid use disorder treatment, evidence-based harm reduction services, overdose prevention measures like naloxone, and recovery support services in all States and territories. Since 2018, the SOR grant program has provided treatment services to over 1.2 million people, and states have purchased nearly 9 million overdose reversal medication kits using SOR grant funds and helped reverse approximately 500,000 overdoses.Provide Food Aid to Support Emergency Needs Abroad and Farmers at HomeHumanitarian needs worldwide remain at unprecedented levels due to more frequent and severe natural disasters and worsening food security. Putin’s war on Ukraine is having a devastating impact on global food availability and costs. Alongside the $10 billion in humanitarian aid in the National Security Supplemental request, the Administration is also requesting funding that will:###"
