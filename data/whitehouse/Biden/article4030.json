    "content": "This year, as Niger marks the 63rd anniversary of its independence, it is facing a grave challenge to its democracy.  In this critical moment, the United States stands with the people of Niger to honor our decades-long partnership rooted in shared democratic values and support for civilian-led governance. The Nigerien people have the right to choose their leaders. They have expressed their will through free and fair elections—and that must be respected. Defending fundamental democratic values, and standing up for constitutional order, justice, and the right of peaceful assembly, are essential to the partnership between Niger and the United States.  I call for President Bazoum and his family to be immediately released, and for the preservation of Niger’s hard-earned democracy.###"
