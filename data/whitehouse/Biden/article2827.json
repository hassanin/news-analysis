    "content": "Jill and I send warm wishes to all those in the Orthodox Christian community who are celebrating Easter, and rejoice with you in the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and the triumph of light over darkness. Today, as we pray for all those suffering from war and persecution, we also give thanks for people around the world who are binding up the wounds of the injured and working to protect the dignity of all—including by welcoming refugees and standing up for human rights. Together, let us all recommit to this work and to forging a better future—one where there is security, liberty, and justice for everyone. Orthodox Christians continue to strengthen communities across our country and around the world—from fostering understanding across different faiths, to advocating responsible stewardship of the environment, to serving others with dignity and respect. During this sacred season and the years ahead, we look forward to continuing to work together to build a more just and compassionate world for all God’s children.###"
