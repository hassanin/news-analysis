The Vice President thanked the Amir for his efforts in securing a deal between Israel and Hamas that provided an extended pause in the fighting which resulted in the release of more than 100 hostages, including Americans, while substantially increasing the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, before the pause was violated by Hamas. The Vice President emphasized that the United States would remain committed to relentlessly pursuing the release of all the hostages in close cooperation with Qatar and other regional partners and expressed continued support for extended pauses in the fighting to get hostages out and aid in.  They discussed the importance of planning for the day after the fighting ends in Gaza. ###"
