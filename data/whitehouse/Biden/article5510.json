Whether you rent or own, having a place to live that you can afford in a neighborhood with opportunities is the foundation for so much else in life.It’s also the foundation for so much else in our economy. A lack of quality affordable housing hinders the job market and holds back economic growth by making it harder for workers to access good-paying jobs. It drives up costs for families and inflationary pressures. It also increases commutes and inefficient energy consumption, which exacerbates climate change. And a lack of affordable housing opportunities perpetuates the ongoing segregation and discrimination that our nation committed to eradicate nearly 60 years ago.That’s why the President’s Budget includes a historic investment to lower housing costs, expand housing supply, improve access to affordable rental options and homeownership, and advance efforts to end homelessness. The Budget includes both mandatory and discretionary housing investments, totaling more than $175 billion. The Budget:Together, the Budget proposes investments and actions that will lower costs for renters and homebuyers, make our economy stronger and more resilient, and advance equity, economic opportunity, and fair housing principles that are central to the President’s economic agenda.Building and Preserving Affordable HousingAmerica faces a longstanding and nationwide shortfall in affordable housing that has been growing for decades. In May 2022, the Administration released a Housing Supply Action Plan that included administrative and legislative actions to close the housing supply shortfall in 5 years. The Administration has already delivered on many of those commitments, and will continue to build on the historic number of multifamily units under construction through additional administrative actions that: make it easier to build and preserve affordable, multifamily supply; advance the production and preservation of homes like accessory dwelling units and manufactured housing; and incentivize state and local governments to reduce barriers to affordable housing development. The President’s Budget builds on that progress and calls on Congress to:Promoting Rental Affordability and Fairness, and Making Progress Toward Universal Housing Vouchers for Extremely Low-Income HouseholdsWhile around 2.3 million low-income households receive rental assistance through the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, another roughly 10 million are eligible and do not receive assistance due to funding limitations and wait lists. The Administration has secured rental assistance for an additional 100,000 households through the American Rescue Plan and the 2022 and 2023 appropriations bills. And in January, the Administration announced a Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights, which enumerated principles to shape federal, state, and local action, and announced agency commitments to strengthen tenant protections and encourage rental affordability.But there is more work to do. For the first time in history, the Budget includes a voucher guarantee for two population groups that are acutely vulnerable to homelessness: youth aging out of foster care and extremely low-income veterans. Between discretionary funding, program reserves, and these mandatory proposals, these vouchers would serve well over an additional 200,000 households. The President’s Budget calls on Congress to:Making Homeownership a Reality for More First-Time and First-Generation HomebuyersAchieving and maintaining homeownership is the primary way that American families build wealth and create economic security. That’s why the Administration implemented a series of measures that protected homeowners from foreclosure during the pandemic, including enhanced loan modifications to resolve delinquencies. In addition, the American Rescue Plan’s Homeowner Assistance Fund is helping struggling homeowners catch up on their mortgage payments and utility costs. These actions have helped keep foreclosures below pre-pandemic levels.It’s also why just last month – as reflected in the President’s Budget – HUD, through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), lowered its annual mortgage insurance premium. This step is projected to save homebuyers and homeowners with new FHA-insured mortgages an average of $800 per year, lowering housing costs for an estimated 850,000 homebuyers and homeowners in the first year. And it builds on steps the Administration has already taken, including changing FHA underwriting policies to allow lenders to use positive rental history in evaluating applicants’ creditworthiness for an FHA-insured mortgage, changing the way in which student loan debt is evaluated in FHA mortgage underwriting, and announcing more than 20 concrete agency actions to root out racial and ethnic bias in home valuations. In addition, the Budget reflects a reduction in mortgage insurance fees for Native American borrowers in the Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Program, which will save borrowers over $500 on average in their first year.But there is more work to do to make the dream of homeownership attainable for more Americans, particularly first-time and first-generation homebuyers who have been locked out of the generational wealth building that can come from homeownership. That’s why the Budget calls on Congress to:  Advancing Efforts to Prevent Evictions and End HomelessnessDuring the pandemic, the Administration stood up a first-of-its-kind national eviction prevention infrastructure, which helped 8 million renter households at risk of eviction and kept evictions below pre-pandemic levels. During one of the greatest periods of economic uncertainty our Nation’s history, we did not see a spike in homelessness.In addition, at the end of last year, President Biden set the bold goal of reducing homelessness by 25% by 2025 with the release of All In: The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness. The Administration’s roadmap is not only about getting people into housing but also ensuring that they have access to the support, services, and income that allow them to thrive. The plan focuses attention on homelessness prevention and actions to ensure an adequate and diverse stock of affordable housing, renter protections, and social service supports. The plan also seeks to promote and expand eviction-prevention reforms, including those advocated as part of the Biden Administration’s implementation of the Emergency Rental Assistance program. The Budget seeks to continue the policies that are most effective in preventing avoidable evictions and give hard pressed American families more opportunities to stay in their homes, even during hard times.
