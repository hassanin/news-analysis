Over the course of three weeks, President Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady Jill Biden, Cabinet members, and Senior Administration Officials will barnstorm across the country to highlight how President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is driving a manufacturing and clean energy boom, rebuilding America’s infrastructure, lowering costs, and creating good-paying jobs. The three-week tour will run from June 26 through July 15, overlapping with the two-week Congressional Recess around Independence Day.During the tour, President Biden and leaders across the Administration will travel directly to communities benefitting from President Biden’s Investing in America agenda. This includes communities seeing new manufacturing and clean energy investments spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act, new infrastructure projects funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, small businesses and families saving money on high-speed internet as a result of the American Rescue Plan, and more.
