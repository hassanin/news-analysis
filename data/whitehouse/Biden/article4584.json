    "content": "Today, the United States House of Representatives passed the Build Back Better Act to take another giant step forward in carrying out my economic plan to create jobs, reduce costs, make our country more competitive, and give working people and the middle class a fighting chance.The Build Back Better Act is fiscally responsible. It reduces the deficit over the long-term. It’s fully paid for by making sure that the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share in federal taxes. It keeps my commitment that no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes.Leading economists and independent experts on Wall Street have confirmed that it will not add to inflationary pressures. Instead, it will boost the capacity of our economy and reduce costs for millions of families.Here are some key parts of the Build Back Better Act: Above all, it puts us on the path to build our economy back better than before by rebuilding the backbone of America: working people and the middle class.I thank Speaker Pelosi and the House leadership and every House member who worked so hard and voted to pass this bill.For the second time in just two weeks, the House of Representatives has moved on critical and consequential pieces of my legislative agenda.Now, the Build Back Better Act goes to the United States Senate, where I look forward to it passing as soon as possible so I can sign it into law.###"
