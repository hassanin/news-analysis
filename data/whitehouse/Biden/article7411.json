    "content": "On his first day in office, the President signed a sweeping executive order directing the entire Federal government to advance an ambitious equity and racial justice agenda—not as a one-year project, but as part of a sustained commitment to make the promise of America real for every American, including rural communities, communities of color, women and girls, Tribal communities, LGBTQI+ individuals, people with disabilities, and communities impacted by persistent poverty. Since then, the Biden-Harris Administration has made significant progress advancing equity across the Federal Government, including by releasing a second executive order in February 2023 that strengthens the government’s ability to create opportunities for communities and populations that have been historically underserved, and continues to build an America in which all can participate, prosper, and reach their full potential.The President’s Budget builds on that progress by making historic investments to support underserved communities and combat racial disparities across the Nation, including in health, education, and economic opportunity.ADDRESSES INEQUITY IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMREDRESSES INEQUITY IN HOUSINGADVANCES EDUCATIONAL EQUITY AND PATHWAYS TO OPPORTUNITYEXPANDS JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITYADVANCES ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESTRENGTHENS THE CARE ECONOMYCOMMITS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND INVESTS IN CIVIL RIGHTSPROMOTES EQUITY ACROSS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES###"
