    "content": "Presidential Memorandum follows a historic agreement signed last week with Tribal Nations to reintroduce salmon into blocked areas in the Upper BasinToday, President Biden signed a Presidential Memorandum to prioritize the restoration of healthy and abundant wild salmon, steelhead, and other native fish populations to the Columbia River Basin. The Presidential Memorandum is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s unprecedented commitment to honor the United States’ obligations to Tribal Nations and protect and restore America’s natural wonders for future generations, while also recognizing the important co-benefits that the Columbia River provides to communities and businesses throughout the region.The Columbia River and its tributaries, wetlands, and estuaries are the lifeblood of the Pacific Northwest. The river ecosystem has supported ways of life, cultural and spiritual practices, commerce, and economic growth for generations and continues to provide our nation with abundant water, power, recreation, agriculture, transportation, and opportunity. Wild salmon, steelhead, and other native fish populations in the Columbia River Basin are essential to the culture, economy, religion, and way of life of Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples. Actions since 1855, including the Federal Government’s construction and operation of dams, private dam building, population growth, and overfishing, have changed the ecosystem and severely depleted wild fish populations in the region, substantially harming the Tribes’ ability to exercise their rights reserved under treaty to hunt and fish in all usual and accustomed places. Since the dams were constructed, 13 fish species have been listed as threatened or endangered.Today, President Biden is directing all relevant Federal agencies to utilize existing authorities and available resources – and assess what additional authorities and resources may be needed – to restore these wild fish populations and help ensure that the United States upholds its treaty and trust responsibilities to the Tribes. The President is also directing the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to explore opportunities and mechanisms to develop a partnership with Tribal Nations and States in the Columbia River Basin to ensure that Federal, Tribal, and State entities work together to achieve this goal.The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to honoring and respecting Tribal sovereignty, protecting Tribal homelands, and incorporating Indigenous Knowledge and robust Tribal consultation into planning and decision-making. The Presidential Memorandum announced today supports Tribally led conservation efforts and helps address injustices of the past, including the decline or elimination of these fish from Tribal lands. It establishes that it is the policy of this Administration to work with the Congress and with Tribal Nations, States, local governments, and stakeholders to pursue effective, creative, and durable solutions to restore wild fish populations while delivering affordable and reliable clean energy, supporting the local agriculture economy, and meeting the many resilience needs of the region.The Presidential Memorandum builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to identify a strong and lasting path forward to restore healthy and abundant wild salmon and other native fish to the Columbia River Basin, President Biden’s call to action earlier this year, and a historic agreement announced last week to support Tribally led efforts to restore salmon in blocked habitats in the Upper Basin. The agreement with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, and Spokane Tribe of Indians will provide over $200 million over 20 years from the Bonneville Power Administration, a federal power marketing administration under the Department of Energy, to help reintroduce salmon into blocked habitats in the Upper Columbia River Basin. In addition, last week the Department of the Interior (DOI) announced $8 million over two years through the Bureau of Reclamation to support these efforts.President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has provided historic resources to support locally led conservation efforts, including in the Pacific Northwest. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act together include record resources for fish passage and ecosystem restoration. Today, DOI is also announcing $3.6 million to support the construction and expansion of Tribally led fish hatcheries in the Columbia River Basin, part of a $10 million investment through the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ Inflation Reduction Act Fish Hatchery Program.Additional Biden-Harris Administration efforts to target resources to support President Biden’s goal of restoring wild salmon, steelhead, and other native fish populations to healthy and abundant levels in the Columbia River Basin include:"
