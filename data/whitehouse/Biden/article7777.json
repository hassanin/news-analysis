The President and President López Obrador agreed that additional enforcement actions are urgently needed so that key ports of entry can be reopened across our shared border.  President Biden has asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, and White House Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall to travel to Mexico in the coming days to meet with President López Obrador to discuss further actions that can be taken together to address current border challenges. ###"
