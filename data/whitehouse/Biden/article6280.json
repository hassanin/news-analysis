Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, the Biden-Harris Administration is already delivering major progress to electrify the great American road trip. Since the President took office, EV sales have more than quadrupled, with more than four and a half million EVs on the road. EV ownership is more affordable than ever before, with prices down over 20% from one year ago. The number of publicly available charging ports has also grown by over 70 percent, with 170,000 publicly available EV chargers across the country, putting us on track to deploy 500,000 chargers by 2026 – achieving the President’s goal four years early.To continue building on this unprecedented progress, today, the Department of Treasury and the Department of Energy are releasing intended definitions for eligible census tracts that will confirm that the Inflation Reduction Act’s 30C EV charging tax credit is available to approximately two-thirds of Americans. This tax credit provides up to 30% off the cost of the charger to individuals and businesses in low-income communities and non-urban areas, making it more affordable to install EV charging infrastructure and increasing access to EV charging in underserved communities.In addition, the Departments of Transportation and Energy are announcing $325 million in new investments this week across three programs to increase the reliability and resilience of publicly accessible chargers, advance EV technologies, and support workforce development for EV charging deployment and maintenance. This new funding for EV chargers will repair and replace existing, non-operational chargers across the country; reduce costs for deploying charging in underserved communities; and cut battery costs. These investments follow the $623 million in awards announced last week to deploy public charging in communities and fill gaps in the national network.The Administration’s historic investments in EV technologies are also spurring private companies to invest alongside the federal government in EV charging. More than $25 billion of investment in the U.S. EV charging network has been announced to date, including more than $10 billion from the private sector. And under President Biden’s leadership, the U.S. EV charging manufacturing footprint has grown from almost nothing to a robust and thriving sector. Just three years ago, there was almost no U.S.-based production of fast chargers, but since President Biden took office, at least 40 U.S.-based EV charger factories have been announced or opened. These facilities now have the capacity to produce more than a million chargers each year—including 60,000 fast chargers.The Biden-Harris Administration is making it easier and cheaper for Americans to ride and drive electric – and to ensure that the EV future benefits American workers and families. But Republicans in Congress are trying to thwart this progress by passing a measure that would eliminate the federal government’s strong domestic manufacturing standards for EV chargers. The President has pledged to veto this resolution, which would hurt American workers, undermine domestic manufacturing, and benefit competitor nations like the People’s Republic of China.Announcements made today and recently are the latest proof that while Republicans in Congress try to undermine historic progress, President Biden is delivering for Americans and the country. See below for more about how the Biden-Harris Administration is building an EV charging network that benefits communities everywhere:Additionally, as a result of the Biden-Harris Administration’s leadership, more than a dozen private companies have announced major commitments to expand EV charging.
