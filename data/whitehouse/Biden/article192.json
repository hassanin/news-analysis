During the meeting, the officials highlighted the Biden-Harris administration’s continued efforts to advance justice and equity for the Black community and all Americans amid a groundswell of harmful attacks on the progress that has been made. They discussed efforts to combat hate-fueled violence, promote inclusion and their shared commitment to advancing legislation to protect voting rights and address other critical issues facing our democracy. Administration Officials provided a progress update on equitable implementation of the President’s Investing in America agenda. The civil rights leaders shared their recommendations to further advance racial equity, provided an update on their work to protect voting rights, and shared ideas to address the risks of artificial intelligence, and strengthen diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the public and private sectors.Meeting participants included:Civil Rights LeadersWhite House###"
