    "content": "Today, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released initial guidance to federal agencies to set a strong foundation for effective, efficient, and equitable implementation of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—a historic investment in rebuilding roads and bridges, providing clean drinking water, and ensuring access to affordable internet. As the President said in the State of the Union, “in my administration, the watchdogs are back.” President Biden has a long-standing commitment to collaboration with Inspectors General (IGs) and the broader oversight community, dating back to his leadership as Vice President when he was tasked with implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. He has made clear that results and accountability go hand-in-hand, and that to deliver results for all Americans, the federal government must act—and support appropriate oversight of its activities—in a manner deserving of public trust. The initial guidance will ensure that there is minimal fraud, waste, and abuse in the implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and projects are delivered on time and on budget by delivering results with accountability, effectiveness, and transparency, collaborating with inspectors general and the oversight community, and, providing technical and financial assistance for communities. The guidance was informed by the Infrastructure Implementation Task Force and stakeholders, reflects discussion with the oversight community, and reflects President Biden’s long-standing commitment to robust oversight and effective stewardship of taxpayer dollars.This afternoon, President Biden and senior administration officials—including OMB Director Shalanda Young, Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu, American Rescue Plan Implementation Coordinator Gene Sperling, and OMB Deputy Director for Management Jason Miller—will meet with agency Inspectors General (IGs) who have been providing oversight to the implementation of the American Rescue Plan and who will provide oversight of implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The meeting will also include the leadership of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) and the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC).  The President, his senior advisors, and IGs will discuss steps they are taking to ensure robust oversight of federal programs.Upon signing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, President Biden signed an Executive Order establishing the Task Force to coordinate effective implementation. Co-chaired by Senior Advisor and Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu and National Economic Director Brian Deese, Task Force members include the heads of federal departments, agencies, and offices with infrastructure implementation responsibilities. The Task Force—which has held 11 Cabinet-level meetings—has focused on cross-agency coordination, ensuring public trust and accountability, and tackling important interagency issues like developing technical assistance and capacity-building resources for state, local, Tribal and territorial governments that will spend as much as 90 percent of the law’s funding. To date, each primary agency has identified an infrastructure implementation coordinator. The White House Infrastructure Implementation Team and agency coordinators have convened at least weekly since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was signed.DELIVERING RESULTS WITH ACCOUNTABILITY, EFFECTIVENESS, AND TRANSPARENCYOne of the primary goals for implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law established by the President’s Executive Order was to “invest public dollars efficiently, avoid waste, and focus on measurable outcomes for the American people.” The initial implementation guidance issued by OMB today directs agencies to ensure accountable stewardship of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, building on effective practices from the Administration’s implementation of the American Rescue Plan, as well as existing financial management and reporting requirements set forth in statute and prior OMB guidance. Additional guidance may be issued by OMB on topics that require further direction, including on the implementation priorities set forth by the President in his Executive Order. The guidance includes direction on:COLLABORATING WITH INSPECTORS GENERAL AND THE OVERSIGHT COMMUNITYAt the President’s direction and through the leadership of the American Rescue Plan Implementation Coordinator Gene Sperling, the Administration has been collaborating across agencies and with the PRAC on the implementation and stewardship of programs funded through the American Rescue Plan. To institutionalize the President’s approach and the lessons learned in ARP implementation, OMB issued guidance last December directing agency leaders to support the important role of agency IGs, including by communicating with their staffs the President’s expectation of cooperation with IG offices.  In the first five months of implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Task Force has regularly met with CIGIE and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and leaders of agencies with infrastructure implementation responsibilities are meeting with their agency IGs, consistent with OMB’s Government-wide guidance on agency-IG cooperation.The new OMB guidance directs agencies to continue this collaboration through implementation of programs funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The guidance includes direction on: PROVIDING TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR COMMUNITIESThe Biden-Harris Administration is working to ensure that the benefits of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law reach all communities, including rural communities and communities that are marginalized, underserved, overburdened, or capacity constrained. These communities often lack adequate resources to navigate complex federal award-making processes. Building on ongoing Administration efforts, the new OMB guidance directs agencies to reduce barriers, including administrative burden, and increase access for communities, funding recipients, and funding beneficiaries. The guidance includes direction on:###"
