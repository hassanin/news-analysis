    "content": "Black small business ownership is growing at the fastest pace in over 30 years, and President Biden will announce new investments to support underserved communities.Today, President Biden will visit the Wisconsin Black Chamber of Commerce to highlight how Bidenomics is helping drive a Black small businesses boom and announce new investments in Milwaukee and communities across the country. Under President Biden’s leadership, the United States is on track to have the three strongest years in history for new small business applications, and with Black business ownership growing at the fastest pace in 30 years.President Biden will be joined by the founder and owner of Hero Plumbing, a Black-owned small business removing lead pipes in Milwaukee, which will help meet President Biden’s commitment to remove all lead service lines in the country by the end of the decade and benefit from the historic $15 billion in funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  While President Biden highlights historic investments from his Administration to support small business, including Black-owned businesses, extreme Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried to dismantle the President’s small business agenda. Every single Republican opposed the American Rescue Plan, which helped small businesses stay afloat during the pandemic and spurred a record small business boom. Many Republicans in Congress, including Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, opposed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. They also want to repeal key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that are lowering health care, prescription drug, and energy costs. President Biden will continue fighting for opportunity for working families and small business owners, while Republicans in Congress want to return to failed trickle-down economics that for too long left too many communities behind.Beyond attacks from Republicans in Congress, over the past few months, there has been an intentional effort to erode ladders to Black economic opportunity.  The President understands that diversity contributes to our economic security and he has made unprecedented investments in Black communities to preserve the American dream.  Investing in Black Entrepreneurship and OpportunitySmall businesses like Hero Plumbing are the backbone of the U.S. economy, creating jobs and opportunities in local communities. President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has driven historic gains in small business creation and entrepreneurship.  Since taking office, Americans have filed a record 15 million applications to start new businesses. Black business ownership is growing at the fastest pace in 30 years, and the share of Black households owning a business has doubled between 2019 and 2022, after falling between 2007 and 2019.When Black businesses do well, they create jobs, generate wealth in their local communities and make the broader economy stronger. As a result, Black wealth is up a record 60% from before the pandemic and Black unemployment has reached historic lows. The Administration’s investment in Black entrepreneurs is producing results, including:New investments and small business growth and local communities across the countryInvesting in local, community-led economic development and small businesses is critical to President Biden’s commitment to build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Milwaukee has seen an economic comeback under President Biden, with the share of the Black population employed reaching a more than decade high and new business applications up nearly 70%.Building on this progress, President Biden will announce that the Grow Milwaukee Coalition is one of 22 finalists for the Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration Distressed Area Recompete Pilot (Recompete) Program. This program, funded by the CHIPS and Science Act, is focused on investing in quality job creation, small business growth and economic opportunity in America’s hardest-hit communities.The Grow Milwaukee Coalition proposal would invest in revitalizing Milwaukee’s historic 30th Street Industrial Corridor and connecting the historically segregated Black community to economic opportunity across the city. Of the 22 Recompete finalists across 19 states and Puerto Rico, eight are specifically focused on growing Black-owned businesses and entrepreneurship and supporting economic development in disadvantaged communities that are majority-Black.The 22 Recompete finalists will compete for $190 million in flexible implementation funding for locally-led economic development plans to create and support small businesses, train workers and connect them to good-paying jobs, investment in infrastructure, and technical assistance.Today’s announcements build on historic progress and investments in Black-owned businesses:###"
