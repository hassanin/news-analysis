The WSFR was reauthorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  Landrieu noted that these grants will make significant progress in our work to protect our cherished natural treasures, and together with other Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments, will make significant progress in our work on collaborative conservation.  From today’s conversation: “The tremendous amount of ongoing, new, or improved collaboration between the federal government, states, local leaders, tribes, nonprofits, and everyone here today will make it possible to build back better. Conservation is something we can all agree on, and as the President has said repeatedly, there’s so much common ground for those who seek to find it.” – Mitch Landrieu, Senior Advisor and White House Infrastructure Implementation CoordinatorParticipants:See Fiscal Year 2022 Apportionment tables by state for the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration funds here."
