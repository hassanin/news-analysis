During this sacred season, we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and the power of faith to lift us up, to change us, and to change the world. We are thankful for the many ways in which Orthodox Christians continue to show love and compassion to their neighbors.As services take place in churches around the nation and the world, we reaffirm the right of all people to practice their faith freely and recommit to standing with those who face discrimination, persecution, and violence because of their faith. We join the Orthodox Christian community in praying for peace, justice, and joy for all God’s children in this new year.###"
