The leaders discussed efforts to advance Ukraine’s economic recovery.  In this regard, they noted the importance of secure export corridors for Ukrainian agricultural products, which contribute to global food security, as well as cooperation on Ukraine’s defense industrial base, which can contribute both to Ukraine’s security and to its economic recovery.  The Vice President welcomed Ukraine’s progress on rule of law reforms and anti-corruption efforts, which are key to attracting private investment and to Ukraine’s EU accession process, and she emphasized the importance of efforts to strengthen Ukraine’s democratic institutions.  The leaders agreed on the importance of continued international support to sustain the morale of the Ukrainian people, who must know that they are not alone as they defend their country against Russian aggression.###"
