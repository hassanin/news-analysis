In 2023, First Lady Jill Biden announced Phoenix as one of five Workforce Hubs where President Biden’s Investing in America agenda—including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act—is driving historic private and public investments while creating pathways into good jobs.  In Phoenix, these investments demonstrate how Bidenomics is growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up.Today’s announcements include: a $5 million private sector commitment to establish a new semiconductor technician Registered Apprenticeship program, a $5 million commitment from philanthropic organizations to provide 1,500 Arizonans with supportive services to enter in-demand jobs of the future, new partnerships between unions and community colleges to expand access to apprenticeship and credentialing programs, and more.Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, Arizona has seen over $77 billion in private investment in semiconductor, battery, electric vehicle, clean energy, and biomanufacturing sectors. In response, the state is rapidly expanding equitable workforce pathways into advanced manufacturing to meet demand for talent in these critical sectors.  In November, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs and the Arizona Commerce Authority announced $4 million from the President’s American Rescue Plan to fund wraparound support services such as child care, transportation tuition, and supplies for apprentices in semiconductor-related Registered Apprenticeships.Building on that investment, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, with support from Governor Katie Hobbs, established a series of critical new partnerships to build talent pipelines in partnership with the Workforce Hub’s two anchor institutions, Maricopa Community College and Arizona State University.  By launching new collaborative efforts with employers, unions, community colleges, and other institutions, Phoenix will support a diverse range of workers to enter and succeed in careers in advanced manufacturing. As a result of this work, the Phoenix region is now home to the Arizona’s first semiconductor Registered Apprenticeship programs and the city’s workforce board is the first-ever to sponsor a Registered Apprenticeship program in this industry.The Hub’s work also supports the Administration’s Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Sprint —an intensive nationwide drive to build a diverse, skilled pipeline of workers for good advanced manufacturing jobs.Major advancements expanding pathways into good jobs from Phoenix Hub collaborators are below.###"
