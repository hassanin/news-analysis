    "content": "During this global energy crisis, brought on by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, it is more important than ever for allied countries to deepen their cooperation to ensure resilient international systems which reflect our shared values.Working with our allies, the United States and United Kingdom commit to intensify our collaboration to support international energy security, affordability, and sustainability, as Europe reduces its dependence on Russian energy. Our immediate shared goal to stabilise energy markets, reduce demand, and ensure short-term security of supply is underpinned by the longer-term objective of supporting a stable energy transition to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, which in itself will strengthen our energy security.To this end, we are establishing a Joint Action Group for Energy Security and Affordability to accelerate our immediate cooperation on short-term action to support energy security and affordability in the United Kingdom and across Europe.The initiative will focus on the following priority areas:1.  Energy Efficiency and Innovative Energy Solutions2.  Gas Supply3.  Nuclear Cooperation4.  International Collaboration on Clean EnergyThe Joint Action Group will be convened by a representative from the offices of the President and the Prime Minister. It will particularly focus on intensifying further commercial and scientific ties between our two countries. It will complement the existing Strategic Energy Dialogue, which is the principal mechanism for collaboration on net zero technologies, financing of nuclear projects, and multilateral initiatives."
