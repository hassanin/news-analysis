Under President Biden’s leadership, within hours of the derailment, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) deployed a team to East Palestine to support state and local emergency and environmental response efforts. The Department of Transportation (DOT) also arrived on scene to investigate what led to the derailment, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) closely coordinated with the Governor, Ohio Emergency Management Agency and Federal and local partners, and Federal officials went door to door to check on families.President Biden pledged he would make Norfolk Southern clean up its mess in East Palestine, and he meant it. EPA ordered Norfolk Southern to clean up environmental damage caused by the derailment, including cleaning or disposing of contaminated soil and water resources, as well as reimbursing the government’s response costs. The EPA and state and local partners are continuing to test the air, soil, and water for dangerous contaminants. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to ensure Norfolk Southern complies with the Federal Unilateral Administrative Order it was issued to cover all cleanup costs, and Federal officials remain on the ground and will continue to closely monitor conditions in the affected communities for as long as it may take to ensure the contamination is fully addressed.As part of his commitment to the people of East Palestine, President Biden is today issuing an Executive Order to ensure that Norfolk Southern continues to be held accountable for this disaster, to address any of the disaster’s long-term effects, and to ensure federal assistance is available to affected communities should needs develop that are not met by Norfolk Southern.The Executive Order directs the following Federal agency actions:Federal Emergency Management AgencyEnvironmental Protection AgencyHealth and Human Services AdministrationDepartment of Transportation###"
