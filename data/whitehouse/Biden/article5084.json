During this sacred season, we remember the miracle of Jesus Christ’s birth and the transformational love He brought to our world. This year, we are keeping the many Orthodox Christian communities in war-torn regions of our globe close to our hearts. Every human being is created in the image of God and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. We mourn every innocent life lost and continue to counter persecution and discrimination against any group because of who they are, what they believe, or how they practice their faith.We are grateful for the invaluable contributions that the Orthodox Christian community makes to our own country and to nations around the world, and we join together in praying for peace in the year ahead.###"
