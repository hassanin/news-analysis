    "content": "President Biden will discuss how the Inflation Reduction Act is creating clean energy jobs in communities across the country, as extreme Congressional Republicans try to repeal the law and deny the impacts of climate changeToday, President Biden will visit CS Wind in Pueblo, Colorado — the largest wind tower manufacturer in the world — to highlight how his Bidenomics agenda is creating jobs and opportunities in Colorado’s third congressional district. CS Wind recently announced it is expanding operations and creating hundreds of jobs as a direct result of the Inflation Reduction Act — which extreme Congressional Republicans like Representative Lauren Boebert called “dangerous for America,” a “massive failure,” and “bad for Colorado’s Third District.”The President’s visit is part of his Administration’s Investing in America tour, where Administration leaders are traveling across the country to highlight how Bidenomics and the President’s Investing in America agenda are delivering for communities across the country and confronting the climate crisis, while Republicans in Congress try to undermine the President’s investments in their communities, deny climate change, and work to block their constituents from good jobs and opportunity.Since President Biden took office, companies have announced $5 billion in investments in Colorado — including hundreds of millions of dollars of investments in Representative Boebert’s district. But if extreme Congressional Republicans like Representative Boebert had their way, Colorado would lose out on billions of dollars of those investments, jobs, and opportunities:And if Representative Boebert had her way, Colorado would have lost out on over $4.6 billion in infrastructure projects already announced in Colorado, including over $1 billion in funding for high-speed internet from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law:President Biden made a commitment that he would be president for all Americans, regardless of political party, and he’s kept that promise. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to deliver for workers and families in Colorado’s Third District and across the country — even if extreme Congressional Republicans put politics ahead of jobs and opportunities created by Bidenomics.###"
