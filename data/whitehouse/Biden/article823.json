    "content": "Inventions resulting from Federal funding should benefit American producers and workers when possible.Bidenomics is mobilizing historic levels of private sector investment in the United States, supporting American innovation and research and development (R&D), strengthening domestic manufacturing after decades of offshoring, and creating new, good-paying jobs, including union jobs and jobs that don’t require a college degree. Over the last several decades, American workers, researchers and companies have created and commercialized many of the world’s most important technologies. However, many innovative technologies have ended up being manufactured elsewhere, even when the research behind those inventions has been funded with taxpayer dollars and can be manufactured domestically. On Friday, July 28,President Biden will sign an Executive Order to prioritize America’s policy of “invent it here, make it here”—to the benefit of American workers, communities, and global supply chain resilience.With the President’s Invest in America historic investments in Federal R&D through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States has a once-in-a-generation package of tools and resources to expand our innovative capacity. Through the government innovation practices in the Executive Order, the Administration will promote R&D investments than can directly support American manufacturing and American jobs in the industries of the future—a key pillar of Bidenomics.To achieve this outcome, today’s Executive Order tackles four core objectives:First, it will improve transparency, cut red tape, and streamline reporting requirements in the Federal R&D process to better track progress towards our domestic manufacturing goals.Second, it will boost the incentive to manufacture new inventions in the United States when those inventions are developed using Federal funds.Third, it encourages the expansion of domestic production for critical industries while maintaining flexibility to build strong international R&D partnershipsFourth, it will make the domestic manufacturing waiver process clearer, timelier, and more consistent, including when production is not commercially feasible.###"
