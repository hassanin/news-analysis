While “Infrastructure Week” became a punchline under his predecessor, President Biden is investing in America to deliver an “infrastructure decade.” As part of the President’s Investing in America agenda, the Biden-Harris Administration is rebuilding our roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes to provide clean water, cleaning up legacy pollution, expanding access to affordable, high-speed internet, and ushering in a new era of clean energy.To date, the Administration has announced over $220 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, including over 32,000 specific projects and awards, across over 4,500 communities in all 50 states, D.C., and territories. To implement the law, agencies have now hired over 5,000 federal employees, and states and territories have appointed infrastructure coordinators to facilitate clear communication and coordination with the federal government.  The White House has created build.gov as a one-stop shop for information about the law and driven massive technical assistance to communities- directly from the government, as well as partners and philanthropy.  The President, Vice President, Cabinet, and senior federal leaders, have taken more than 300 trips to all 50 states, as well as D.C., Puerto Rico, and the territories, to discuss this once-in-a-generation opportunity with community members. Today, the White House Infrastructure Implementation Team released a new map highlighting signature projects in all 50 states, along with a map showcasing the more than 32,000 projects and awards identified or underway.Implementation of the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a key piece of his Investing in America agenda, which is growing the economy from the bottom up and middle out – driving over $470 billion in private sector manufacturing and clean energy investments in the United States and creating good-paying jobs that don’t require a four-year degree. In particular, there have been major new private sector manufacturing announcements in electric vehicle (EV) charging, EV battery, rail, buses and fiberoptic cable manufacturing spurred by infrastructure investments and our Made in America policies.FROM BREAKING GROUND TO CUTTING RIBBONS ON MAJOR PROJECTSKey projects are moving forward across the country – many of which had been waiting decades on the sidelines – thanks to the historic investments from the Biden-Harris Administration. This includes:18 MONTHS OF DELIVERING INFRASTRUCTURE RESULTSThe Biden-Harris Administration has made notable progress implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law across key sectors.### "
