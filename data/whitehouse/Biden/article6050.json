They exchanged views on Russia’s military build-up near Ukraine’s border and affirmed the importance of Allied unity in diplomatic and deterrence efforts. Mr. Sullivan reiterated U.S. support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Article 5 and underscored the United States’ readiness to support our Eastern Flank Allies as they defend their countries. Mr. Sullivan also conveyed President Biden’s appreciation for Polish President Duda’s veto this morning of a controversial media amendment, noting that this sent a positive signal just before Poland takes over the Chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on January 1.###"
