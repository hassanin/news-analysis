Today, the Administration is implementing the first tranche of sanctions that go far beyond 2014, in coordination with allies and partners in the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia. And as President Biden promised, we worked with Germany to ensure the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will not move forward.The President has directed the following measures:These actions come in addition to steps being taken by our Allies and partners and represent our first response to Russia’s actions.
