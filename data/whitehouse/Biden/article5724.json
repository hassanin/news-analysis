The Administration officials underscored that this is the first year we have three vaccines to protect against flu, COVID-19 and RSV. During the briefing, Administration officials recommended that people get vaccinated in October ahead of the holiday season when people will be gathering with family and friends, along with a reminder to order four free tests per household on COVIDTests.gov. In addition, Administration officials took questions from stakeholders on issues including the best places to find information about where to get the new updated COVID-19 vaccine – vaccines.gov – and steps being taken to get vaccines into nursing homes and assisted living facilities.Administration officials closed the meeting by thanking stakeholders for their leadership in their communities, reminding them of their impact as trusted messengers to help get the word out to Americans to get vaccinated, get tested and get treated – actions that will truly save lives and improve the quality of life across the country.View the full briefing here.Administration Participants Included:###"
