In May, the Biden-Harris Administration named Augusta and Pittsburgh two of five Workforce Hubs where President Biden’s Investing in America agenda—including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act—are catalyzing historic private and public investments and creating good-paying jobs. In Augusta and Pittsburgh, and across the country, these investments show how Bidenomics—the President’s vision for growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up—is creating high-quality career opportunities for students and workers.Key commitments to expand pathways into good jobs from Augusta and Pittsburgh Hub collaborators are below.Augusta Launches New Registered Apprenticeship Programs and Over $1 Million in Employer Investments in Workforce Pipelines:Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, Georgia has seen over $37 billion in private investments across new battery and electric vehicle supply chain facilities, clean energy manufacturing, and semiconductors and electronics. These significant economic investments are creating over 27,000 new jobs in Georgia alone.To meet this accelerated demand, Augusta needs a diverse pipeline of skilled workers. That’s why Mayor Garnett Johnson and the Augusta Workforce Hub’s three anchor institutions—Augusta Technical College, Aiken Technical College, and the Richmond County School System—have catalyzed a series of new partnerships and deepened existing collaborations that will connect a broad range of people in the region to good-quality careers.First, five major regional employers are committing to actions that will develop the workforce:Second, major regional training providers are expanding programs for skill development in occupations related to clean energy manufacturing, nuclear energy, construction, cyber, and the development of key next-generation technologies for advanced manufacturing:Third, a wide array of regional stakeholders will collaborate to help address systemic workforce barriers:Pittsburgh Will Create Over 1,000 New Jobs and Expand Apprenticeship Programs in Industries Spurred by the Investing in America Agenda:Led by Mayor Ed Gainey and Partner4Work, the workforce development board for the Pittsburgh area, the Pittsburgh Workforce Hub is focused on creating equitable career pathways in four key sectors— infrastructure, advanced manufacturing (including robotics and biomanufacturing), high-speed internet, and clean energy—as well as occupations that support these sectors (e.g., cybersecurity).To guide the Hub’s work, the City developed the Pittsburgh Good Jobs Principles, a set of principles for job quality, equity, and worker empowerment that build on Biden-Harris Administration’s Good Jobs Principles. The Pittsburgh Principles are driving concrete actions and new partnerships to ensure local workers—particularly disadvantaged workers and residents of high-need communities—can access good jobs with family-sustaining wages, high-quality training like Registered Apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships, and critical supportive services like child care and transportation.First, employers will create more than 1,000 good jobs for residents of the Pittsburgh region. This includes:Second, education and training organizations will expand pre-apprenticeships, Registered Apprenticeships, and other earn-and-learn training opportunities to more than 500 additional workers next year alone, including:Third, local education institutions will develop pathways into robotics, cybersecurity, and advanced manufacturing. For instance:Finally, training providers, philanthropies, and other collaborators will remove barriers to employment and expand recruitment in underserved communities, including:###"
