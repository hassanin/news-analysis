    "content": "On Wednesday, senior Biden-Harris Administration officials met again with manufacturers of RSV immunizations including Sanofi and AstraZeneca and their partners. They discussed the need for manufacturers to work quickly to meet demand for dose availability through the commercial market this viral season. At the urging of the Administration, manufacturers confirmed that they will make available 230,000 additional doses of RSV immunizations for infants in January. This announcement comes on top of the 77,000 additional doses of Beyfortus that were released last month following the Administration’s continued efforts’ urging manufacturers to expedite availability. The meeting follows several in-person and virtual meetings, including last week, to ensure manufacturers are identifying every opportunity to make more RSV immunizations for infants available. Also in the meeting, senior Administration officials and manufacturers continued conversations on the importance of proactively planning to increase availability and meet projected demand for the 2024-25 viral season.###"
