They will reaffirm the deep, historic partnership and extraordinary people-to-people ties between the United States and Ireland. They will also discuss combatting COVID-19, addressing global challenges, increasing our shared prosperity, and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland.  Although the pandemic prevents the traditional White House celebration of St. Patrick’s Day this year, we look forward to marking this holiday and our close relationship with Ireland in a safe way.###"
