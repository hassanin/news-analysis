    "content": "Today, at the White House, President Biden is hosting the United We Stand Summit to counter the corrosive effects of hate-fueled violence on our democracy and public safety. The Summit will honor the resilience of communities who are healing from hateful attacks, including mass shootings, from Oak Creek to Orlando, Charleston, Pittsburgh, El Paso, Atlanta, Buffalo, and beyond. The Summit will put forward a shared vision for a more united America, demonstrating that the vast majority of Americans agree that there is no place for hate-fueled violence in our country, and that when Americans stand united to renew civic bonds and heal divides, we can help prevent acts of hate and violence. Today’s Summit is just the beginning of this work and every American has a role to play in this cause. Today at the Summit, President Biden will rally a whole-of-society response to prevent, respond to, and recover from hate-fueled violence, and to foster national unity.New Actions by the Federal GovernmentTo help meet these challenges, the Administration will take new steps, including the following:Actions to strengthen federal coordination on preventing, confronting, and recovering from hate-motivated violence and fostering unityThe White House Initiative on Hate-Motivated Violence established today will strengthen interagency coordination in preventing and responding to hate-motivated violence, leverage federal research and resources, and enhance engagement and consultation with diverse stakeholders, including communities targeted for who they are or what they believe.Actions to help prevent hate-fueled violenceActions to improve the federal response when violence occurs and to help communities recoverActions to promote civic renewal and foster national unityIn addition to the executive and agency actions outlined above, President Biden is calling on Congress to enact substantially increased investments in national service and civics education, which are vital to strengthening our social fabric and forging a deeper sense of common purpose and national unity.President Biden also calls on Congress to build on the landmark public safety legislation he signed over the last year, including the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, with new legislation to make the country safer by helping to prevent hate-motivated violence.New Actions from Non-Federal Public and Private Institutions to Foster Civic UnityPresident Biden understands that addressing hate-based violence takes an all-of-society effort. That is why it is so important to have engagement from non-federal public and private institutions to prevent, respond to, and recover from hate-fueled violence, and to build bridges and foster greater social cohesion:As part of this effort to gather inputs from Americans of all regions and backgrounds, the Citizens’ Initiative will host virtual and in-person public listening sessions this fall, with details to come in the weeks ahead. The public – especially individuals in communities that have suffered hate-motivated violence – are invited to share their experiences and recommendations for addressing this shared challenge at Dignity.us.After several months of this learning, the Citizens’ Initiative will develop a set of recommendations and drive the implementation of a plan of action “from the nation, for the nation,” with a focus on greatly scaling effective community-based efforts.  This effort is supported by a diverse group of foundations, including the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Democracy Fund, Ford Foundation, Kettering Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Omidyar Network, Open Society Foundations, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Stand Together, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and more than 40 community foundations across the country.Commitments from the Technology Sector: As the President and Vice President have underscored, technology plays a critical and necessary role in Americans’ lives, but advancements in digital technologies, including social media and other online platforms, have also led to unintended consequences—including the spread of violent extremist ideologies and mobilization to violence—for which the technology sector must bear responsibility. Americans know how the internet can fuel hate, misogyny, and abuse with spillover effects that threaten the safety of our communities offline. Today’s announcements from the tech sector take a step towards recognizing the important role companies play in designing their products and platforms to curb the spread of hate-fueled violence both online and off.###"
