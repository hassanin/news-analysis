The President thanked President Al-Sisi for Egypt’s important role in this process, and they affirmed that all efforts must now be made to conclude a deal that would result in the release of all hostages together with a prolonged humanitarian pause in the fighting. They also discussed intensifying efforts to further increase the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance into and throughout Gaza.
