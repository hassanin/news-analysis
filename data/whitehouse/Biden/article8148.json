They are also aware that such regulations may have unintended consequences and result in barriers to trade between them and that such barriers, once implemented, can be challenging to remove. Consequently, the United States and the European Union intend to work to identify and avoid potential new unnecessary barriers to trade in products or services derived from new and emerging tech, while ensuring that legitimate regulatory objectives are achieved.This work will fully respect each side’s regulatory autonomy and regulatory system, and will promote the highest level of openness and transparency and welcome input from all interested stakeholders.Cooperation on Trade and LaborThe United States and the European Union intend to promote together and in an inclusive way the protection of fundamental labor rights, including by combatting the scourge of forced and child labor, with each side using relevant trade policies and tools, including FTAs and unilateral measures, such as preference and other programs, and cooperating in the ILO, WTO, and other appropriate multilateral fora. Both sides intend to promote responsible business conduct, with the aim of enhancing the sustainability of global value chains. In pursuit of these objectives, we intend to:Cooperation on Trade-Related Environmental and Climate Policies and MeasuresThe United States and the European Union underline the positive role that trade can play in addressing environmental challenges such as climate change, achieving climate neutrality, and supporting the transition to a more circular economy. The United States and the European Union intend to consult on the inclusion of trade-related climate and environment issues in the work plan of the Global Trade Challenges Working Group.Consultation with StakeholdersThe United States and the European Union welcome input from and dialogue with business, trade unions, consumer organizations, and environmental and other non-government organizations on the work of the Global Trade Challenges Working Group, including joint input from transatlantic groupings of stakeholders.###"
