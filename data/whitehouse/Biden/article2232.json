RiceToday is National Voter Registration Day, when eligible Americans are encouraged to register to vote, as well as confirm that they are registered at the right address. The right to vote, and to have one’s vote counted, are bedrock principles of our democracy. Since their first days in office, President Biden and Vice President Harris they have mobilized the entire federal government to strengthen our democracy and protect voters from suppression and subversion. Unconscionably, state legislatures across the country have passed laws that make it harder to vote. Recent Supreme Court rulings have made it even harder to counter discrimination. To fight back against these deeply disturbing attacks on voting rights, President Biden and Vice President Harris have repeatedly urged the Senate to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act — including calling for changing Senate rules to prevent a minority of Senators from blocking action to protect this fundamental right.In the meantime, the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to using every tool at its disposal to protect the sacred right to vote. On March 7, 2021, the anniversary of “Bloody Sunday,” President Biden signed an executive order directing an all-of-government effort to promote access to voting. Agencies are working to implement this order and have recently taken the following steps:Agencies across the government will continue to implement President Biden’s Executive Order using their own authorities, rolling out new initiatives as they are ready, to promote information about the electoral process and encourage electoral participation. Today and every day, the Biden-Harris Administration is dedicated to making the voting process smoother and more accessible for every eligible American."
