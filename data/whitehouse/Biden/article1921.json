    "content": "National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Republic of Korea 1st Vice Foreign Minister Cho Hyundong and Vice Defense Minister Shin Beomchul to discuss the U.S.-ROK Alliance, regional security situation, and U.S-ROK efforts to strengthen deterrence in the face of the DPRK’s increasingly destabilizing activities. They discussed measures to follow up on the successful summit between President Biden and President Yoon, including addressing the threat posed by the DPRK’s unlawful ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs, and working to ensure stability across a free and open Indo-Pacific. Mr. Sullivan reaffirmed the U.S extended deterrence commitment to the ROK, using the full range of U.S. capabilities, and lauded the resumption of the U.S.-ROK Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group as well as the delegation’s visit to Joint Base Andrews to tour a U.S. B-52 Strategic Bomber.###"
