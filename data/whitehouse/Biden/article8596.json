    "content": "On Friday, October 6, on National Manufacturing Day, the Biden-Harris Administration will kick off another multi-week Administration-wide tour highlighting how Bidenomics and President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is benefitting communities across the country.The tour will feature President Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady Jill Biden, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, Cabinet members, and Senior Administration Officials making dozens of stops in the coming two weeks to show how Bidenomics is growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up. This comes as Republicans in Congress continue to try to block President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, try to repeal critical pieces of legislation that have created jobs and helped drive over $500 billion in private sector investments since the beginning of his Administration, and oppose investments that are creating jobs and opportunities in their own districts. Throughout the tour, the Biden-Harris Administration will highlight the split screen contrasting how President Biden is delivering for the American people, while Republicans in Congress try to push their extreme MAGAnomics agenda and failed trickle-down policies of the past.The tour will kick off on Friday, where First Lady Jill Biden will visit Dutchess Community College in Fishkill, New York and attend the launch of a new mechatronics training lab funded in part by President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. On Friday, the Administration will also hold an Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Sprint convening at the White House – officially kicking off an intensive drive to build a diverse, skilled pipeline of workers for good jobs, including union jobs, in advanced manufacturing.Over the course of the tour, President Biden and Administration leaders will make major announcements around infrastructure – made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, private sector investments driven by the Inflation Reduction Act, and highlight historic actions by the Biden Administration to combat climate change, advance environmental justice, and create good-paying jobs in industries that will drive American competitiveness. The tour will also underscore that President Biden’s investments are leaving no community behind, and helping cities and towns across America become centers of innovation, job creation, and opportunity.As part of the Investing in America tour:###"
