My local fire company in Wilmington saved my life, and thousands of Americans all across the country have stories like mine. Firefighters and emergency responders always have our backs, and we should always have theirs.Today, my Department of Labor is proposing a rule thatÂ would strengthen safety standards for emergency responder equipment, training, and vehicle operations for the first time in more than 40 years. These new standards would prevent thousands of injuries for more than one million brave emergency responders across the country.I have fought for emergency responders and firefighters my entire career, and my Administration will continue doing everything it can to make sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs safely.###"
