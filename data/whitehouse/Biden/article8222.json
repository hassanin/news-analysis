EDT THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll speak about one thing: Mrs. Casey.  Nothing else. Q    Okay. THE PRESIDENT:  Do you have a question about Casey? Q    Yes.  What was her role in — in your life? THE PRESIDENT:  She played an enormous role, not just in my life but everyone’s.  You know, there’s a quote my sister always uses about Michelangelo.  It says: He saw the angel in the marble, and he carved and he set it free.  That’s who she was.  She was an incredible woman — decent, honorable.  Her values were amazing.  And every time I would go to Scranton over the years, I would stop and see her.  She was a friend. Anyway, I’m going up or I’m going to be late for Bobby. Q    Will you come talk to us about Hawaii? Q    On the Camp David summit, are you willing to share what your goals are for the summit, sir? THE PRESIDENT:  Not until I meet with them. Q    Okay.  Thank you. 11:48 A.M. EDT "
