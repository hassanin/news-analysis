    "content": "Today, on my orders, the United States military conducted an operation to extract U.S. Government personnel from Khartoum.  I am proud of the extraordinary commitment of our Embassy staff, who performed their duties with courage and professionalism and embodied America’s friendship and connection with the people of Sudan.  I am grateful for the unmatched skill of our service members who successfully brought them to safety.  And I thank Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Saudi Arabia, which were critical to the success of our operation.      I am receiving regular reports from my team on their ongoing work to assist Americans in Sudan, to the extent possible.  We are also working closely with our allies and partners in this effort. This tragic violence in Sudan has already cost the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians.  It’s unconscionable and it must stop.  The belligerent parties must implement an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, allow unhindered humanitarian access, and respect the will of the people of Sudan.  We are temporarily suspending operations at the U.S. Embassy in Sudan, but our commitment to the Sudanese people and the future they want for themselves is unending.###"
