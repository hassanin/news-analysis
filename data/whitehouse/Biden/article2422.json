    "content": "Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened Attorneys General from seven states to discuss the fight for reproductive rights. The roundtable followed recent meetings about reproductive rights that the Vice President held with health care providers, faith leaders, and constitutional law, privacy, and technology experts, and was part of the Administration’s work to build coalitions and preparedness in response to the attack on reproductive rights. The Vice President told the Attorneys General that they play a pivotal role in defending a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body. She spoke about how Attorneys General have a role in protecting the health, safety, and wellbeing of the women in their state — and as a result, can consider the various authorities they have to defend reproductive rights and freedoms, including access to abortion. The officials shared the steps they have taken so far to protect access to reproductive health care in their states, and they discussed their powers under their authority as their state’s chief legal officers. The Vice President thanked the Attorneys General for their leadership in safeguarding our nation’s most fundamental rights and freedoms. She encouraged them to continue striving for new ways to protect reproductive rights. Participants:###"
