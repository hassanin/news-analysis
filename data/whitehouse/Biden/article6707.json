    "content": "The U.S. economy has been tested in the past two years, creating challenges unlike any since the Great Depression.  As Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Cecilia Rouse has been at the forefront navigating this unprecedented economic moment. No matter the challenge, Cecilia provided insightful analysis, assessed problems in a new way, and insisted that we examine the accumulation of evidence in drawing conclusions. And, she’s maintained steadfast calmness through it all. Today’s economy looks very different than when Cecilia joined my Administration: we’ve created over 12 million jobs, unemployment is near a 50-year low, American manufacturing is booming, and over 10 million new small businesses have been created.  Cecilia shares my economic vision, and has always understood that my north star was not just getting us back to a pre-pandemic economy, but building one that is more resilient, fair, inclusive, and honors everyday workers across the country.  I want to thank Nidal and Safa for sharing their mom with us. We will miss Cecilia greatly, but I know that she will continue this important work back at Princeton and in the years to come. ###"
