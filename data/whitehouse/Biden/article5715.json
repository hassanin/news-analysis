Thanks to my Administrationâ€™s whole-of-government approach, we now have the tools to manage COVID-19 and the virus no longer controls our daily lives.For the last year, I have relied on Dr. Ashish Jha to help me do just that as the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator. As one of the leading public health experts in America, he has effectively translated and communicated complex scientific challenges into concrete actions that helped save and improve the lives of millions of Americans.I extend my deepest thanks to Ashish and his family. We are a stronger and healthier nation because of his contributions to public service.###"
