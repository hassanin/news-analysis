    "content": "While I’m here in this union hall with you, the Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy went to Wall Street two days ago to describe the MAGA economic vision. It was the day before Tax Day. Do you think he told the wealthy and powerful that it was finally time to start paying their fair share of taxes? No.Do you think he told billion-dollar companies to stop stashing profits in tax havens and shipping jobs overseas? No.Instead he proposed huge cuts to important programs that millions of working- and middle-class Americans count on. All the while he and MAGA officials are separately pushing more tax giveaways that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.Folks, it’s the same old trickle-down dressed up in MAGA clothing. Only worse.###"
