    "content": "Launched by President Joe Biden, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Charles Michel at the U.S.-EU Summit in June 2021, the Trade and Technology Council held its inaugural meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 29, 2021. U.S. Co-Chairs, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai, were joined by EU Co-Chairs European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis to establish common principles to update the rules of the road for a 21st century economy and deliver for our people.The United States and the EU are home to 780 million people who share democratic values and the largest economic relationship in the world. We will work together to generate shared economic growth that benefits working families, farmers and ranchers, and businesses with a particular focus on opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises. At the meeting, the United States and European Union decided to closely coordinate on an expansive set of critical economic and technology issues over the coming months and achieve concrete outcomes by the next meeting:  The TTC co-chairs tasked the working groups with developing work plans to strengthen our cooperation on additional critical areas. This includes prompting small- and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs) access to digital tools, securing critical supply chains, cooperating on emerging technology standards, advancing climate and clean tech objectives, data governance and technology platforms, information and communications technology security and competitiveness, and the misuse of technology threatening security and human rights.In addition, the inaugural TTC included a meeting with a broad range of stakeholders and we intend to continue robust engagement with a diverse range of stakeholders, including but not limited to industry, labor organizations, think tanks, non-profit organizations, environmental constituencies, academics, and other civil society members.###"
