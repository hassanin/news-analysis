In addition, SBA announced that they will be creating a Small Business Lending Federal Advisory Committee in the coming months to continue hearing directly from lenders and other stakeholders about how to best meet the capital needs of small businesses, especially in underserved communities.Last year, the SBA provided $50 billion in capital to small businesses nationwide, partnering with lenders to provide a historic $34 billion in small business loans through their signature 7(a) and 504 loan programs. These loans have helped promote inclusive economic growth, with $5 billion going to women-owned businesses, a record $3 billion going to Latino-owned businesses, and a doubling of loans to Black-owned businesses since 2020. In addition, under President Biden, Americans have filed a record 14.6 million new business applications and business ownership rate among families has risen 9% since 2019, with particularly strong gains for Hispanic and Black households. Today’s roundtable provided an opportunity for administration officials and lending leaders to discuss strategies to build on these successes and bring small business growth to new heights.The summit featured two roundtable discussions as well as remarks by SBA Administrator Isabel Casillas Guzman, NEC Director Lael Brainard, and Council of Economic Advisors Member C. Kirabo Jackson. In the first roundtable, participants discussed emerging trends in small business lending, including new technology and financing structures, and how federal agencies can support continued innovation. Participants shared successes from their small business lending strategies and highlighted how recent SBA changes to modernize their lending programs have allowed for a broader and more diverse set of credit worthy businesses to access loans, and how their improved processes have accelerated access to capital for small business borrowers. For the second roundtable, participants heard from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director (CFPB) Rohit Chopra and Acting Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Michael J. Hsu about key actions these independent regulators have taken to expand access to capital for underserved communities – including the issuance of new final rules. Participants discussed strategies and shared best practices on promoting equity in small business lending, as well as how better data collection and reporting can help banks further target their lending to underserved communities.The following Administration officials participated in the summit:The following lending partners participated in the summit:###"
