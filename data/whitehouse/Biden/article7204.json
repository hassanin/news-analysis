    "content": "The Biden-Harris Investing in America Agenda is sparking a manufacturing, construction, and clean energy renaissance across the country. To help ensure America’s workers can access the good jobs created by historic new investments, the Administration is aligning on a whole-of-government effort, the Roadmap to Support Good Jobs. The purpose of this collaborative vision is to build our workforce by ensuring every American—whether they go to college or not—will have equitable access to high-quality training, education, and services that provide a path to a good career without leaving their community.To accomplish the President’s vision of growing our economy from the bottom up and middle out, we will strengthen and expand our workforce by partnering with employers to provide opportunities for good-paying, family-sustaining jobs across the country. The President’s historic investments in a future Made in America will create millions of jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, supply chains, and manufacturing here at home, through the American Rescue Plan (ARP), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. Breaking down longstanding barriers that have left many on the sidelines, including women and people of color, is not just an historic opportunity—it’s an economic necessity.To meet this moment, we must ensure students and workers at all stages of life have equitable access to education and training for good jobs in their communities. At the heart of this effort is ensuring the full range of our education and training systems, including middle and high schools, community colleges, community organizations, unions, and more, work in lockstep with employers to prepare and place millions of students and workers from all backgrounds in sustainable quality jobs across critical sectors—including clean energy, semiconductor manufacturing, construction, healthcare, information technology, education and child care, and biotechnology.The roadmap focuses on four priorities: 1) connecting people to good jobs; 2) ensuring we have the skilled, diverse workforce for our transformational investments; 3) boosting education and training efforts so every community can meet its foundational labor needs; and 4) creating good quality, family-sustaining jobs, including union jobs.In its first two years, the Biden-Harris Administration has already taken historic steps in these four areas, with provisions to strengthen our workforce built into the President’s signature legislation, which can help serve as demonstrations to build off in future initiatives. Today, the White House is announcing a series of actions to build on that progress that will connect American workers to good-paying jobs and make sure no community is left behind.  1. Connecting People to Good Jobs: To achieve the President’s goals, we must channel the full skills and talents of all our people. The Administration is committed to ensuring all people can find and keep quality jobs in their communities and that companies can find the best talent. That means expanding free and affordable job training opportunities such as Registered Apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship; ensuring that wherever possible, federal funds support services (such as child care) that help Americans enter and remain in the workforce; and encouraging employers to hire workers based not on the degrees they have, but the talent and skills they possess.Actions to achieve these goals include:Key actions to date:2. Preparing Workers for Our Transformational Investments: The Administration has made major investments through the ARP, BIL, CHIPS, and the Inflation Reduction Act that will create new jobs in sectors vital to economic and national security such as advanced manufacturing, cybersecurity, climate resilience, and electrification. The success of these historic investments, and the building of a sustainable, resilient economy for every community, depends upon the Nation’s education and training systems adapting to emerging needs in these growing sectors. In particular, we need to ensure schools and colleges, unions, non-profit organizations, and governments at every level are collaborating with employers to meet our economy’s needs and bring in workers traditionally underrepresented in these fields. To that end, the Administration is taking action to convene employers, labor unions, and workforce development organizations to develop high-quality education and training standards, portable credentials, and labor-management partnerships to ensure a diverse, skilled workforce and good jobs in critical supply chains. We are expanding career-connected learning strategies for youth, including work-based learning, college credit, and industry credentials; and maximizing use of federal workforce investments, including new Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax incentives for projects employing Registered qualified apprentices from Registered Apprenticeship programs and training funds in BIL and CHIPS.Actions to achieve these goals include:Key actions to date:3. Ensuring Every Community Can Meet Its Foundational Labor Needs: The Administration will continue work to meet both long-term and urgent labor supply needs and improve job quality in sectors foundational to our economy and communities—urban and rural—such as health care, child care, education, and transportation. This effort will require innovating and strengthening education-to-workforce connections nationwide, ensuring that education and training opportunities serve youth, students, and workers at every stage of their career. To that end, the Administration is strengthening high-quality, affordable career pathways to healthcare and teaching jobs so that we have the nurses and teachers we need; improving the quality of vital jobs such as child care, home care, and meatpacking that experience recruitment and retention challenges; and ensuring that supportive services like child care and transportation assistance are integral to our workforce investments.Actions to achieve these goals include:Key actions to date:4. Boosting Job Quality to Promote Recruitment and Retention: The President’s goal is to ensure every job is a good job—consistent with the Good Jobs Principles—meaning they are well-paying, quality jobs, with benefits, safety, stability, and worker voice. Key to this effort are expanding workers’ rights to organize and collectively bargain and enhancing employer responsibility for creating good jobs that people want to keep. To achieve this, we’re working to triple Registered Apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships to ensure high-quality jobs—including union jobs—are accessible to those previously excluded; and embedding job quality criteria in federal funding opportunities. And we’re ensuring employers: comply with worker protection laws; root out bias, discrimination, and harassment in the workplace; guarantee workers a free and fair choice to join a union; and provide high-quality benefits such as health care and child care.Actions to achieve these goals include:Key actions to date:###"
