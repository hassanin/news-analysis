Officials emphasized that supporting these organizations is central to the Administration’s ongoing work to advance health equity, increase access to affordable, quality health care, and protect the health and well-being of every American. In a context where safety-net health providers often face resource constraints and are recovering from the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, the energy efficiency and renewable energy investments made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act can decrease operating costs and free up resources for essential patient services as well as make them more resilient. The Charge Partnership, Valley Children’s Hospital, and the National Academy of Medicine all presented on their efforts to make the sector more resilient.At the event, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that its Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE) will be leading a catalytic program in early 2024 to help safety-net health care organizations take advantage of the transformative tax credits and grant programs created by the Inflation Reduction Act. The program will also involve safety-net provider member associations like America’s Essential Hospitals, National Rural Health Association, and the National Association of Community Health Centers. The three-month program will feature national webinars as well as breakout sessions for hospitals, health centers, and other provider types to help organizations assess their needs and assets, learn about Inflation Reduction Act tax credits and grant programs, and successfully utilize these opportunities. Interested individuals and organizations can receive information about the program by visiting OCCHE’s website and signing up for the OCCHE Alert email list.   Many participants in today’s convening made new announcements, including:The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to partnering with safety-net health care organizations and the broader health sector as they leverage the Inflation Reduction Act to protect the health and well-being of their communities through resilience, protect the environment through sustainability, and save on energy bills through energy efficiency."
