Delphin-Rittmon hosted a convening with U.S. drug manufacturers who currently have FDA-approved opioid overdose reversal medication products. During the meeting, senior Biden-Harris officials reiterated President Biden’s clear and urgent directive to increase access and affordability of these life-saving overdose reversal medications, and underscored the critical role manufacturers play in the all-of-society effort to help end the nation’s overdose crisis. The officials also called on manufacturers to take robust actions in support of the Biden-Harris administration’s guiding principles, which include that no one who needs overdose reversal medications should lack access because of costs or availability; that at-risk communities should be saturated with these medications to reduce fatality rates; that organizations serving high-risk individuals should not need to ration these medications; that more must be done to raise public awareness; and that public health agencies need timely, actionable data on distribution and gaps in access.Participants included:###"
