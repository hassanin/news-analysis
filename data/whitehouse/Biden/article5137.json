Biden, Jr. will host Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders at the White House on September 25, 2023 during the second U.S.-Pacific Island Forum (PIF) Summit taking place September 25-26. During this year’s summit with Pacific Islands leaders, President Biden will reaffirm the U.S. commitment to our shared regional priorities and deepening our cooperation around them – including tackling the climate crisis; advancing economic growth; promoting sustainable development; strengthening health security; countering illegal, unreported fishing; and expanding our people-to-people ties. Building upon last year’s historic U.S.-Pacific Island Country Summit, President Biden will highlight the ways the U.S. continues to deliver on our promise to further strengthen our partnership with the Pacific Islands and hear from Pacific Islands Forum leaders how we can increase cooperation to address the mounting challenges of our time.###"
