Our hearts are also with the dozens of civilians who were killed or injured, including precious children, and their families.  We grieve with all those who are mourning this heartbreaking tragedy.  Mr. Monastyrskyy and his team were deeply involved in the preservation of Ukraine’s democracy—both its defense against Russian aggression, and the vital work of reforms to strengthen Ukraine’s institutions through this war and into the future.  A reformer and patriot, Mr. Monastyrskyy championed the will of the Ukrainian people. We will continue to honor that legacy through efforts to strengthen Ukraine’s institutions, and in our unfailing partnership with the people of Ukraine to keep the flame of freedom bright.  Today, we are praying for healing for the wounded and comfort for those who have lost loved ones.  The United States stands with the people of Ukraine in the face of this tragedy, and for as long as it takes.###"
