And we wanted to share this moment with you – our military children. You answer the call of duty for your country, and the President and I are so grateful. So, we wanted to say thank you, and share some of the magic, wonder, and joy of this season with you. Now, how many of you have seen the Disney movie, “Frozen?” Do you know Elsa? Do you know Anna? Do you know Olaf? Well, we have a very special performance to get all of you ready for the magic of the holidays! Please help me welcome to the White House, the cast of Disney’s stage musical, “Frozen!”###"
