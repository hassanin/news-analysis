    "content": "President Biden has made clear that every veteran deserves a roof over their head, and since Day One, his Administration has made lowering housing costs and addressing homelessness — particularly among veterans — a top priority.Today, the Biden-Harris administration is announcing new actions to prevent and reduce homelessness among veterans through actions that include launching supportive services to quickly rehouse veterans experiencing homelessness; providing new legal services for veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness; and funding programs to help veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness find jobs and connect to work. The Administration will also invest an unprecedented $3.1 billion to help communities across the country quickly rehouse people experiencing homelessness, including veterans.These actions build upon historic investments by the Biden-Harris administration to address veteran homelessness that have driven historic reductions in homelessness amongst veterans.   Today the number of veterans experiencing homelessness has fallen by 11% since early 2020 and by more than 55% since 2010. They will also advance the Administration’s goal to permanently house at least 38,000 veterans in 2023. Specifically, the Administration is:President Biden’s American Rescue Plan represented the largest single-year investment in ending homelessness in U.S. history and helped prevent a surge of homelessness across the country. Earlier this year, HUD released a series of grants totaling $486 million, as well as approximately 3,300 housing stability vouchers to help 62 communities address unsheltered and rural homelessness and homeless encampments. And, in May, the Biden-Harris Administration launched ALL INside, a new initiative to address unsheltered homelessness in selected communities.The President’s Fiscal Year 2024 Budget also proposes unprecedented investments—not only to urgently address homelessness, but also to prevent homelessness, including through additional housing vouchers; emergency rental assistance; increasing the supply of affordable housing; and establishing a guarantee of rental assistance for extremely low-income veterans and youth aging out of foster care—two groups disproportionately at risk of and experiencing homelessness.###"
