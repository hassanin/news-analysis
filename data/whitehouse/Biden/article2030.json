    "content": "We invite all Global COVID-19 Summit participants to join us in aligning around the global targets and taking the associated required actions to end the COVID-19 pandemic and build back better. These global targets and associated actions by governments, international institutions, and the private sector are drawn from those targets set out by the Multilateral Leaders Task Force on COVID-19, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT)-Accelerator, the G20, the G7, and members of multiple expert commissions. These targets and associated actions are ambitious – but they are what we need to get on course for ending this pandemic and with it, the risk it imposes on our countries, communities, health and livelihoods. We must act now to vaccinate the world, save lives, and build back better. Only by working together in pursuit of a shared vision can we defeat the COVID-19 pandemic and help prepare the world for future pandemics. We also invite all participants to join us in monitoring our collective progress. By aggregating information on what each of us is doing we can measure our progress and take the steps that will be needed so that we don’t fall behind. TARGETS: VACCINATE THE WORLDAsks for Governments & International Institutions with Relevant Capabilities: Fall 2021Proposed Private Sector Commitments: Fall 2021TARGETS: SAVE LIVES NOWAsks for Governments & International Institutions with Relevant Capabilities: Fall 2021Proposed Private Sector Commitments: Fall 2021for next generation COVID-19 (ideally oral) therapeutics for low-resource settings.TARGETS: BUILD BACK BETTERAsks for Governments & International Institutions with Relevant Capabilities: Fall 2021Proposed Private Sector Commitments: Fall 2021###"
