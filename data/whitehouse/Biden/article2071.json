Today, we received further proof that our efforts are delivering record-breaking results.More Americans than ever before have signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. From November 1st to January 15th, over 16.3 million Americans signed up for insurance on HealthCare.gov and the state-based Marketplaces.  This is more than double the number of Americans who signed up for coverage during the first ever Affordable Care Act Open Enrollment in 2014.  And for the more than 30 states that use HealthCare.gov, there has been a combined 50 percent increase in enrollment since I took office in January 2021.Over the last few months, four out of five consumers looking for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act were able to find health care coverage for as little as $10 a month or less. These lower rates — which were originally delivered as part of my American Rescue Plan — were set to expire at the end of 2022, but thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, we extended them and millions of families are continuing to save $800 per person per year on their premiums. We’ve made record-breaking progress in expanding coverage and lowering health care costs for American families, saving them money and giving more Americans the peace of mind that comes with affordable health insurance.###"
