Biden, Jr. held a bilateral meeting ahead of a St. Patrick’s Day celebration with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar of Ireland at the White House.  The leaders reaffirmed the historic ties and shared values that link the United States and Ireland, as well as the extraordinary bonds between our people.  They discussed their countries’ shared commitment to continue supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia’s brutal aggression, with President Biden praising the generosity of the Irish people in hosting 80,000 people who have fled the conflict. They also talked about their cooperation on a range of other global issues.
