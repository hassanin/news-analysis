But junk fees are chipping away at their savings, going to financial advisers with conflicts of interests instead of to American families, and making retirements less secure.Right now, when a financial adviser provides retirement advice, they may be paid by the saver or by the firm who makes the investment product they recommend. Responsible retirement advisers deserve to be paid for their important work. But when a firm pays a retirement adviser more to recommend a specific investment product, that creates a conflict of interest that often leads to Americans selecting an investment product recommended to them that generates lower returns. And these conflicts of interest are meaningful: an adviser may receive a commission as high as 6.5 percent to recommend some insurance products. When the saver pays for advice that is not in their best interest, and it comes at a hidden cost to their lifetime savings, that’s a junk fee.These costs add up. Requiring advisers to make recommendations in the savers’ best interest can increase retirement savers’ returns by between 0.2% and 1.20% per year. Over a lifetime, that can add up to 20% more retirement savings—potentially tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars per impacted middle-class saver that could otherwise have been lost to junk fees. For example, advice rooted in conflicts of interest regarding the sale of just one investment product—fixed index annuities—may cost savers as much as $5 billion per year. This hurts workers, families, and the American economy.That’s why today, as part of his broader Bidenomics agenda to grow the economy from the middle out and bottom up, President Biden is announcing that the Department of Labor will propose a new rule to close loopholes and require that financial advisers provide retirement advice in the best interest of the saver, rather than chasing the highest payday. This step would minimize junk fees in retirement products, promote competition, and protect American workers’ retirements. Specifically, the rule would:The proposed rule builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to eliminate junk fees, putting cash back in the pockets of Americans. The Federal Trade Commission proposed a rule that would ban businesses from charging hidden and misleading fees and require them to show the full price up front and a “click-to-cancel” rule making it as easy to sign up for a service as to cancel it. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took action to require large banks and credit unions to provide basic information to consumers without charging fees. The Department of Transportation has proposed several new rules that would lead to more transparent pricing by airlines and reimburse customers when there are significant changes to their flight.Today’s announcement also builds on important actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to protect the retirement of hardworking Americans. In December 2022, President Biden signed SECURE 2.0 into law, which encourages more employers to offer retirement plan benefits to their workers and makes it easier for Americans to save. Additionally, as part of the American Rescue Plan, President Biden signed the Butch-Lewis Emergency Pension Plan Relief Act, which protects the pensions of 2 to 3 million workers.###"
