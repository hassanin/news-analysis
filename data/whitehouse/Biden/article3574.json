He affirmed that the United States, together with its allies and partners, will continue to hold the Lukashenka regime accountable for its actions. They discussed the recent measures taken by the United States in response to the regime’s ongoing crackdown against the pro-democracy movement, flagrant human rights abuses, including the continued imprisonment of more than 1,400 political prisoners, and facilitation of Russia’s war against Ukraine. ###"
