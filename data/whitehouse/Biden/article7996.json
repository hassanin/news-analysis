    "content": "This afternoon, the President had a constructive virtual meeting with 12 progressive members of Congress about how critical the Build Back Better Act and the bipartisan infrastructure bill are to his vision for ensuring our economy delivers for middle-class families, and not just those at the very top. The group discussed their shared commitment to seizing this moment to make investing in families the heart of our economic growth and competitiveness strategy, paid for by repealing failed tax giveaways for the rich and big corporations that have been holding us back from reaching our full potential in the global economy. They also covered the immense benefits that the infrastructure bill will mean for communities all across this nation in terms of public transit, climate and clean energy leadership, ensuring safe drinking water for kids, and cleaning up pollution that disproportionately harms communities of color. There was agreement that what mattered most with respect to Build Back Better was following through on key priorities in a final legislative package to make a difference in real lives. Tomorrow, the President will host another virtual meeting with moderate House Democrats.Members of Congress attending the meeting:###"
