The Vice President reiterated the importance of protecting civilian lives and respecting international humanitarian law, as Israel defends its citizens from Hamas terrorism.  They discussed the urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza and discussed ongoing efforts, including through recent initiatives announced by the UAE, to increase the flow of food, water, and medicine to civilians in need.  The Vice President made clear it is critical to ensure that Palestinians are not forcibly displaced outside of Gaza and underscored the Palestinian right to self-determination, and that Israelis and Palestinians must have equal measures of security, prosperity, and freedom.  The Vice President reaffirmed the United States’ enduring commitment to the safety and security of the Emirati people and ongoing efforts to strengthen the defense partnership between the United States and the UAE.  They also discussed the importance of deterring threats from any state or non-state actor, especially those seeking to expand the conflict, and the Vice President condemned recent attacks by Iranian-backed militias across the region. "
