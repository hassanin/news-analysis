The United States is an Arctic nation, which instills responsibility for the stewardship and protection of this region, especially during this period of change.The United States seeks an Arctic region that is peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative. The new National Strategy for the Arctic Region articulates an affirmative U.S. agenda over the next ten years to realize this vision. This strategy, an update of its 2013 predecessor, addresses the climate crisis with greater urgency and directs new investments in sustainable development to improve livelihoods for Arctic residents, while conserving the environment. It also accounts for increasing strategic competition in the Arctic, exacerbated by Russia’s unprovoked war in Ukraine and the People’s Republic of China’s increased efforts to garner influence in the region, and seeks to position the United States to both effectively compete and manage tensions.This strategy recognizes that there is no bright line between foreign and domestic policy. Realizing our vision during this dynamic period will require U.S. leadership at home and abroad. We will advance U.S. interests in the Arctic across four mutually reinforcing pillars spanning both domestic and international issues.This strategy is intended to serve as a framework to guide the U.S. government’s approach to tackling emerging challenges and opportunities in the Arctic. Our work will be guided by five principles that will be applied across all four pillars.###"
