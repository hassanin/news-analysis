We send our deepest sympathies to their families and to all those who have been impacted by this senseless violence.While the facts of this tragedy are still being investigated, we know that far too many people live with the fear that they could be targeted and attacked based on their beliefs or who they are. We are grateful for the work of law enforcement and will continue to do all that we can to keep our communities safe from both hate and gun violence.###"
