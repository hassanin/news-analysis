Still, too many are left without high-speed internet because they lack the infrastructure, or are inhibited by high costs or lack of technological skills. In particular, these inequities impact communities of color, rural communities and older Americans where the lack of affordable, reliable high-speed internet contributes to significant economic, health and other disparities.That’s why President Biden and Vice President Harris worked with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to make sweeping changes to lower the cost of internet for families across the country as part of the Biden Administration’s Investing in America Agenda, including a record $65 billion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make sure all Americans finally have access to affordable, high-speed internet.Already, 16.75 million households are saving over $500 million per month on high-speed internet through the Affordable Connectivity Program. Now, the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing an additional $73 million in Affordable Connectivity Outreach Grants to help more Americans sign up for the program and save on internet costs. These investments include:  Driving Down Costs through the Affordable Connectivity ProgramThe Affordable Connectivity Program, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is the largest internet affordability program in our nation’s history. The effort to bring high-speed, affordable internet to every American household is part of the Biden Administration’s Investing in America agenda, and the resources secured through the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are helping make critical progress toward that goal.The Affordable Connectivity Program, administered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), provides eligible households up to $30/month (or up to $75/month on qualifying Tribal lands) off internet bills, as well as a one-time discount of up to $100 off a laptop, desktop computer or tablet. To further lower costs, in May 2022, President Biden and Vice President Harris announced commitments from internet service providers across the country to offer high-speed plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program—meaning millions of working families can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. They simultaneously launched GetInternet.gov—a one-stop shop to check eligibility and sign up.In July 2022, the Vice President made a call to action to states and federal agencies to help spread the word about the Affordable Connectivity Program.  This call to action led to tens of millions of text messages, emails, letters and flyers sent directly to consumers to inform them about this opportunity. Last month, Vice President Harris announced that the Affordable Connectivity Program is now reaching over 16 million households, saving Americans over half-a-billion dollars per month. This is a more than 40% increase since the announcement of GetInternet.gov.The Biden-Harris Administration’s Internet for All Initiative will ensure that everyone in America has access to reliable and affordable high-speed internet.
