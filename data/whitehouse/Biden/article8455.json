Biden, Jr. spoke today with His Majesty Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, the Sultan of Oman.  The two leaders reaffirmed the longstanding historical ties between our countries and peoples, and discussed mutual efforts to forge a more prosperous, peaceful, and integrated Middle East region.  President Biden thanked Sultan Haitham for his personal leadership and support for the UN-mediated truce in Yemen, which over the past year has witnessed its longest period of calm since the war began over a decade ago.  He also welcomed Oman’s recent decision to open its airspace to all civilian aircraft, including those flying to and from Israel.  Both leaders committed to strengthening the U.S.-Oman strategic partnership, trade and investment opportunities, and cooperation on clean, diversified, secure energy sources.  President Biden finally welcomed Oman’s historic role in securing the freedom of American citizens wrongfully held in Iran. ###"
