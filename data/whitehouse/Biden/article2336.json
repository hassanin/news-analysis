He also expressed gratitude for the commitment of UNRWA’s staff to deliver humanitarian aid and provide essential services in Gaza.  The two discussed the critical importance of protecting civilians, including UN staff and other aid workers, and continuing to mitigate any potential aid diversion to Hamas. The United States remains committed to supporting the Agency’s critical work as a lifeline for millions.  Finer underscored the importance of the agency’s work to enable life-saving humanitarian aid to reach those in need in Gaza.###"
