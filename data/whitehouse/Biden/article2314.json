    "content": "Yesterday, the White House hosted local leaders who represent significant African American populations to discuss the opportunities and challenges with training a skilled workforce for the President’s Investing in America agenda. White House staff from the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and Inflation Reduction Act implementation teams provided an overview of the resources and workforce funding opportunities available from the investments. The group then had an open dialogue with the leaders from these communities on their workforce needs. The elected officials from these counties emphasized how these historic investments will help rebuild and strengthen their respective communities. The elected officials praised the flexibility of the American Rescue Plan and its ability to provide funding for supportive services like transportation and career readiness efforts. The officials also discussed challenges on sustainability of funding for supportive services and the need to create pathways and opportunities for students in high school. The Administration committed to supporting these counties through our workforce resources and continued dialogue. This was the second in a series of virtual sessions. The White House previously met with African American mayors on their workforce challenges, and has heard from local elected leaders and staff from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. The White House will continue this effort by bringing together more stakeholders to support equitable training pathways.Workforce Resources for Local Governments:  ###"
