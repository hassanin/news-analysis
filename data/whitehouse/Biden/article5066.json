    "content": "On Tuesday, the White House convened a roundtable with civil society leaders, researchers, and policymakers on how the data broker industry monetizes personal information and actions the Administration is taking to address potential  harms to American consumers. The session was hosted by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Economic Council, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of Justice.Earlier that day, the CFPB announced that it plans to propose rules to ensure all data companies comply with the law and prevent brokers from selling certain data, limit the disclosure of sensitive “credit header” contact information, and give consumers the right to obtain data about themselves from brokers and dispute inaccuracies. Administration officials pledged in Tuesday’s session to continue using their authorities to subject data brokers to greater regulation and oversight, and to curb the harms they cause.Participants shared stories, insights, and concerns about the harms and risks that data brokers’ practices create for everyday Americans. Issues raised include the surreptitious collection, use and sale of detailed sensitive data; data-driven scoring that limits access to housing and economic opportunities for Black and brown communities; predatory scams targeting individuals with cognitive vulnerabilities; increased risks to personal safety, including gender-based violence; and insufficient oversight of brokers under existing law.Participants explained how data brokers purchase or acquire large volumes of exceedingly detailed data about people including geolocation and health information—often without their knowledge or consent. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, attendees cautioned, have rapidly expanded data brokers’ abilities to draw inferences about individuals’ lifestyles, desires, and weaknesses, and are incentivizing rampant data collection to fuel their development. Participants also discussed the many different parties to whom brokers sell data—including advertisers, financial institutions, employers, landlords, and fraudsters—and the harms those sales have caused individuals and communities. Many shared stories of people who saw applications for credit and housing denied after reviewers purchased sensitive information about them—including data that was inaccurate, outdated, or not fit for purpose. Participants underscored how the data broker economy enables discriminatory practices in credit underwriting, insurance, housing, employment, and advertising, continuing patterns of exclusion that disproportionately harm underserved and vulnerable groups. Participants also described how data brokers have sold geolocation data to people who have used it to stalk and harass women, and interfere with women’s access to healthcare.Civil Society ParticipantsOpening SpeakersParticipantsGovernment ParticipantsOpening SpeakersParticipants###"
