    "content": "Today, the President and Vice President met with 12 Latino leaders to discuss the Build Back Better Agenda and this Administration’s commitment to equity. During the meeting, the President and Vice President reiterated their promise to invest in Latino families and businesses across the country as we work to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downfall that resulted from it. The President and Vice President discussed their belief in the American Dream and the promise of America for all, and they vowed to continue working to strengthen our democracy and protect voting rights. Two years after the El Paso massacre, they vowed to keep fighting against the most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland – domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy, hate-fueled violence in all forms, and the scourge of gun violence in America. President Biden and Vice President Harris also restated their support for immigration reform in reconciliation that provides a path to citizenship for Dreamers, farm workers, TPS holders, and essential workers.Latino Community Leaders in Attendance:###"
