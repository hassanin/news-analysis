    "content": "The Supreme Court temporarily paused a lower court decision that attempted to override FDA’s decades-old approval of mifepristone. For now, mifepristone remains available and approved for safe and effective use. The President and his Administration continue to stand by FDA’s evidence-based approval of mifepristone, and we will continue to support the FDA’s independent, expert authority to review, approve, and regulate a wide range of prescription drugs. The stakes of this fight could not be higher in the face of ongoing attacks on women’s health, and we will continue to fight to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade.###"
