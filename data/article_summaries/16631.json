On April 23, 2009, the White House released a readout of President Obama's meeting with Ambassador Chris Hill. Ambassador Hill had been confirmed by the Senate to serve as the Ambassador to Iraq, and the President wanted to speak with him before he left for his new post. They discussed the current situation in Iraq and the importance of making political progress. The readout also included photos of the President and Vice President's meetings with Ambassador Hill.
