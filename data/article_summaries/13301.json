President Obama has nominated Judge Jon S. Tigar and William H. Orrick, III to serve on the United States District Court. Judge Tigar has been a judge on the Alameda County Superior Court since 2002 and has prior experience in complex commercial litigation. William H. Orrick, III currently serves as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice and has previously worked at a San Francisco law firm. Both nominees have impressive legal backgrounds and, if confirmed, will be valuable additions to the United States District Court.
