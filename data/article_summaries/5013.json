The White House has announced over $500 million in additional investment for climate resilience across the United States. This comes as Americans are experiencing the devastating impacts of climate change, with a record number of billion-dollar weather and climate disasters this year. President Biden is leading an ambitious climate, conservation, and environmental justice agenda, and he is hosting the first-ever White House Summit on Building Climate Resilient Communities. The summit aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and better manage climate threats through locally tailored, community-driven strategies. The Administration has also released the National Climate Resilience Framework, which guides and aligns climate resilience investments and activities by the federal government and its partners. Additionally, the Administration is taking more than a dozen new actions and announcing funding to help build a climate resilient nation. These actions include boosting climate resilience in buildings, strengthening local engagement and partnerships, bolstering workforce and community benefits, and ensuring resilient lands and waters. These announcements follow previous investments in climate resilience through President Biden's Investing in America agenda, including the launch of the American Climate Corps and investments in combating extreme heat and storm-induced flooding.
