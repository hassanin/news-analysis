Second Lady Karen Pence visited the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland to view an art exhibit titled "Battle Signs: Using Art Therapy to Process TBI and PTS Injuries and Trauma." The exhibit showcased artwork created by Wounded Warriors as part of an art therapy program at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital. The program aims to help active-duty service members in rehabilitative treatment for traumatic brain injury and psychological health conditions. Mrs. Pence had the opportunity to speak with the military service members who created the artwork and an art therapist who worked with them. The exhibit provides insight into the struggles that military service members face, such as the loss of friends and identity, guilt, and grief. Mrs. Pence commended the art therapy program for its role in the healing process. The National Museum of Health and Medicine sees this exhibition as an opportunity to shed light on military medical care and research. Mrs. Pence is an advocate for art therapy and has chosen it as her initiative to champion. Art therapy is an integrative mental health profession that uses art-making and creative processes to enrich the lives of individuals, families, and communities.
