President Biden has made addressing the overdose epidemic a priority in his agenda. He aims to crack down on global illicit drug trafficking, particularly the flow of illicit fentanyl and its precursors. As part of this effort, President Biden and President Xi Jinping of China announced the resumption of bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics. China has taken law enforcement action against illicit precursor suppliers and issued a notice to industry warning against illicit trade in precursor chemicals. The country has also committed to restarting key law enforcement cooperation. The Biden-Harris Administration is taking various measures to disrupt the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and its precursors into the United States, as well as dismantle firearms trafficking networks that aid drug traffickers. They are also expanding access to public health services and removing barriers to treatment for substance use disorder. President Biden has requested significant funding for prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services. The United States and China have launched a counter-narcotics working group to facilitate discussions and information exchange on law enforcement efforts. These actions are part of the Administration's comprehensive approach to combating global illicit drug trafficking.
