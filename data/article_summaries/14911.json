National Poison Prevention Week, 2009 was proclaimed by President Barack Obama to raise awareness about the dangers of poisonous substances and educate Americans on how to prevent and respond to poisonings. The American Association of Poison Control Centers reports that over two million potential poison exposures are reported annually, with more than half involving children aged five and under. The most common sources of poisonings are medicines and household chemicals. Simple steps such as keeping poisonous materials in their original containers, out of reach of children, and following handling instructions can help prevent poisonings. The proclamation encourages Americans to familiarize themselves with the issue and take steps to protect their families. The third week of March is designated as National Poison Prevention Week.
