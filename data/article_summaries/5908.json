In this article, President Biden discusses his administration's efforts to crack down on hidden fees, also known as "junk fees," that companies sneak into bills and burden American families. He highlights the impact of these fees on middle-class families and emphasizes the need for transparency in pricing. President Biden mentions various sectors, such as banking, hotel costs, rental housing, cable, internet, concerts, airlines, and healthcare, where his administration has taken steps to eliminate these fees. He specifically focuses on the retirement savings industry and the sale of annuities, expressing concern about financial advisors and insurance brokers selling bad annuities to retirees for personal gain. To address this, the Department of Labor is proposing a new rule that would require all financial advisors giving retirement advice or selling retirement products to act in the best interests of their clients. President Biden believes this action is necessary to protect workers, save for retirement, and promote fairness in the economy. He concludes by emphasizing his vision of building an economy that benefits everyone, not just the wealthy, and expressing optimism about America's future.
