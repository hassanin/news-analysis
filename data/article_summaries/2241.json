The press briefing covered a range of topics including President Biden's forceful speech on the January 6th insurrection, the situation in Kazakhstan, COVID-19, voting rights, and other issues. Here are the key points:

1. President Biden's Speech on January 6th: Press Secretary Psaki explained that President Biden has consistently spoken out about the threat former President Trump posed to democracy. The speech delivered on January 6th was a passionate call to protect democracy and ensure that the events of that day are not forgotten. The President will continue to speak about the importance of voting rights in an upcoming speech.

2. Situation in Kazakhstan: Secretary Blinken had a productive call with the Kazakhstan foreign minister and expressed support for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. The U.S. is closely monitoring reports of peacekeeping forces being dispatched to Kazakhstan and is calling for the protection of human rights.

3. COVID-19: The President's goal is to defeat the virus. The administration is focused on expanding testing, vaccination, and treatment options to reduce hospitalization and deaths. The President believes in following the guidance of health experts, including getting vaccinated, boosted, and wearing masks when recommended.

4. Voting Rights: The President will give a speech next Tuesday on the importance of voting rights. He supports the passage of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The administration is calling on Republicans in Congress to protect democracy and not perpetuate the "Big Lie."

5. Former President Trump's Response: The former president called President Biden's speech "political theater." Press Secretary Psaki suggested that he may have learned something from the speech, but it remains to be seen.

6. Unifying the Country: The President believes in the importance of unifying the country, but some Republicans in Congress need to decide whether they want to perpetuate the "Big Lie" or be part of saving democracy. The focus should be on protecting fundamental rights and not allowing attempts to distract from that.

7. Omicron Variant and Vaccination: The President's goal is to defeat the virus, but the administration is also focused on expanding treatment options. The CDC advises people to be up to date on their shots, including boosters. The definition of "fully vaccinated" may evolve based on the latest guidance from health experts.

8. Vaccine Mandates: The decision on vaccine mandates for schools is up to local school districts. The administration has not discussed mandating vaccines for domestic air travel, as masking is considered effective in protecting people on flights.

9. Consequences for January 6th: The President believes the Justice Department should act independently and make decisions regarding consequences for the events of January 6th. He supports the work of the January 6th committee but does not want to prejudge its outcome.

10. Ambassador Swearing-In Ceremonies: The swearing-in ceremonies for ambassadors can vary, and there is no set requirement for how they should take place. Some ambassadors have been sworn in at the White House, while others have been sworn in by leaders in their own communities.

11. Open Schools: The President wants schools to be open and has provided funding for schools to implement mitigation measures. The administration will continue to make the case for schools to open and address the mental health and learning gaps caused by closures.

12. Religious Freedom: The President believes in a woman's right to choose and has a consistent position on this issue.

13. Foreign Policy: The administration is assessing the recent attacks on U.S. forces and is working to determine attribution and intent. There is no specific information on the groups responsible at this time.
