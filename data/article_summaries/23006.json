The United States and United Kingdom have announced a partnership to advance girls' education around the world. They will launch a nearly $200 million initiative, with a focus on supporting adolescent girls' education in countries affected by conflict and crisis. The partnership includes investments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where funds will be used to provide access to education for girls in conflict-affected areas. The initiative aims to enroll out-of-school girls in accelerated learning programs, reduce barriers to education, mobilize parents and communities to support girls' education, improve teaching and learning materials, and enhance students' reading skills. The partnership also includes efforts to build an evidence base around adolescent girls' education programming, with a focus on improving the quality of education, increasing access to education in conflict and crisis situations, and strengthening opportunities for adolescent girls to acquire necessary skills. Other organizations, such as the U.S. Peace Corps and Camfed, will be invited to collaborate and share community-based solutions to impact adolescent girls worldwide.
