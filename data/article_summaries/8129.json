The latest report indicates that Bidenomics is successfully growing the economy from the middle and bottom, rather than the top. Since President Biden took office, the economy has generated 14 million jobs, including 150,000 in October. The unemployment rate has remained below 4% for 21 consecutive months, the longest period in over 50 years, while the number of working-age Americans with jobs is higher than pre-pandemic levels. These improvements have been achieved alongside a 60% decrease in inflation and the lowest core inflation in two years, contrary to predictions that higher unemployment would be necessary to bring down inflation. President Biden encourages Republicans in Congress to collaborate in boosting the economy and reducing inflation, rather than jeopardizing the economy or prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations over programs benefiting hardworking families, seniors, and national security.
