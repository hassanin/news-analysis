The article is a notice from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the actions of the government of Syria. The notice states that the national emergency was initially declared in 2004 and has been modified and extended several times since then. The actions of the Syrian government, including supporting terrorism, pursuing weapons of mass destruction, and obstructing the Lebanese government, continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The notice also condemns the use of violence and human rights abuses by the Assad regime and calls for a political transition in Syria. The United States will continue to monitor the situation and consider changes in the Syrian government's actions in determining whether to continue or terminate the national emergency in the future.
