The Vice President of the United States held a conversation with elected officials and community leaders about the importance of supporting small businesses. Small businesses are not only business leaders but also community and civic leaders who encourage innovation and ambition. Half of America's workforce works for or runs a small business, making them vital to the economy. The administration has invested in community banks, known as CDFIs, because they understand the needs of small businesses better than big banks. The focus is not just on providing loans but also on helping small-business owners with payroll, taxes, and business growth. The administration's efforts have led to the largest growth of small businesses in America in the last two years. The government is also investing in clean energy and American manufacturing, which are often driven by small businesses. This conversation aimed to discuss ways to further support small businesses.
