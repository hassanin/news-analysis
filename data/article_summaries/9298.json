Jennifer Klein, Neera Tanden, and Mitch Landrieu from the Biden-Harris Administration met with leaders and advocates to discuss advancing Black women's economic security and equal pay. Currently, Black women typically earn 69 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. This wage gap undermines their financial security and costs them nearly one million dollars over a 40-year career. The meeting addressed various factors contributing to gender and racial wage gaps, such as pay discrimination, barriers to good-paying jobs, and caregiving responsibilities. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken actions to close wage gaps, including being a model employer and prohibiting the use of salary history for federal workers and contractors. Efforts to strengthen child care infrastructure and ensure women's access to good-paying jobs in sectors where they have been underrepresented, such as transportation, construction, and clean energy, were also highlighted. Strategies for further closing wage gaps and opportunities for partnership were discussed.
