The Biden-Harris Administration has awarded $225 million in American Rescue Plan funds to train over 13,000 Community Health Workers (CHWs). This is part of a larger investment of over $1.1 billion for community health, outreach, and health education workers. These investments aim to expand the health care workforce and address pandemic-related burnout. CHWs are cost-effective public health workers who improve population health and strengthen health systems, particularly in underserved communities. They serve as trusted messengers and advocates, facilitating communication between individuals and health care providers. The American Rescue Plan has made historic investments in the community health workforce, including recruiting, training, and supporting health care professionals, surging resources to state and local public health departments, and addressing America's mental health and substance use crisis.
