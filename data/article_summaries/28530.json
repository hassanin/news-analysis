The President's Infrastructure Initiative aims to improve broadband access in rural America by providing critical funding. The plan dedicates $50 billion to rural infrastructure, accounting for 25 percent of all Federal spending in the plan. States will have the flexibility to spend up to 100 percent of the Federal funding on improving rural broadband access. This initiative aims to address the issue of inadequate broadband access in rural areas, which hampers economic growth and educational opportunities for rural Americans. Expanding broadband access will offer a better quality of life and more economic opportunities for rural communities.
