The United States has been a leader in the fight against malaria, saving millions of lives and preventing billions of infections worldwide. However, despite the progress, a child still dies every two minutes from malaria. The disease is developing resistance to drugs and mosquitoes are developing resistance to insecticides. Climate change is also making it easier for malaria-carrying mosquitoes to breed and spread the disease. To address these challenges, the United States will host the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria's Replenishment Conference to accelerate the fight against malaria. The goal is to create a malaria-free future and build a safer and more equitable world.
