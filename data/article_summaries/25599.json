Second Lady Karen Pence hosted a business summit at the White House to address military spouse unemployment. Fifty-seven businesses and organizations attended the summit to discuss their progress in developing plans to tackle this issue. Companies like Amazon, BMS, Deloitte, and Lockheed Martin presented their action steps and shared ideas for other businesses to create similar plans. Mrs. Pence launched a campaign in 2018 to recognize the service of military spouses and advocate for better career opportunities. She partnered with American Corporate Partners to organize these business summits.
