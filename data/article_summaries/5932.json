Vice President Kamala Harris addressed a group of leaders at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She thanked Dr. Bernice King for the invitation and acknowledged the presence of other notable figures such as Presiding Bishop Michael Curry and Pastor Sam Collier. Harris spoke about the importance of fighting for justice and equality, drawing inspiration from the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. She highlighted the current threats to voting rights, particularly in Georgia and across the nation, where anti-voter laws are being passed. Harris stressed the need to protect democracy and ensure that every American has the freedom to vote. She called on the United States Senate to pass "The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act," which aims to secure voting rights. Harris concluded by urging everyone to continue the fight for freedom and honor Dr. King's legacy.
