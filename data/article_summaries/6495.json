President Joe Biden has declared a state of emergency in Mississippi and authorized federal assistance to help with the water crisis that began on August 30, 2022. The declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate relief efforts and provide aid to the affected population. FEMA is authorized to mobilize resources and equipment as needed to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. The federal assistance, including direct aid, will be funded at 75% by the federal government for a period of 90 days. Allan Jarvis has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas.
