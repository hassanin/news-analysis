President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued a determination under the Defense Production Act of 1950, stating that radiation-hardened and strategic radiation-hardened microelectronics, along with their components and manufacturing systems, are critical resources for national defense. The President has determined that without his action, the United States industry would not be able to provide these resources in a timely manner. Therefore, he has authorized purchases, purchase commitments, or other actions to expand domestic production capabilities for these supply chains. This determination has been directed to be published in the Federal Register.
