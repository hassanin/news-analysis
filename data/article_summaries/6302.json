The President met with the White House Competition Council to discuss the progress made in delivering cost savings to American families and to plan for future actions. The Council, established through an executive order in July, aims to promote competition in the economy and coordinate initiatives to restore competition. The President commended the Council for meeting deadlines and highlighted examples of how their actions will benefit American families, such as lower prices and fairer wages. During the meeting, each member agency discussed their top competition priorities, which include reducing prices for everyday items like internet plans, groceries, shipping costs, and vacation travel.
