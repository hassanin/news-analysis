First Lady Michelle Obama is celebrating the fourth anniversary of her Let's Move! initiative, which aims to promote healthy living for children. She will be highlighting examples of people, communities, and organizations that are participating in this movement. The First Lady is encouraging people of all ages to show how they move towards a healthier future on social media using the hashtag #LetsMove. Since the launch of Let's Move! in 2010, there have been improvements in access to healthy food, changes in school health environments, and a decline in obesity among low-income preschoolers. Michelle Obama will be participating in various events and interviews to commemorate the anniversary, including a visit to the Taking Back the Streets exhibit in New York City, an appearance on "The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon," an announcement on school wellness in Washington, D.C., and an announcement about healthy out-of-school time in Miami, Florida. She will also be making an announcement regarding proposals to help parents and consumers make healthier choices and will be visiting a local child care facility in Bowie, Maryland.
