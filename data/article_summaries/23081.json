The U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership is a commitment between Presidents Obama and Yudhoyono to strengthen relations between the two countries. It recognizes the importance of cooperation between the world's second and third largest democracies, the potential for economic and development cooperation, and the need for cultural exchanges and mutual understanding. Progress has already been made, including the launch of a Peace Corps program, agreements for science and technology cooperation, and a defense cooperation arrangement. There have also been high-level consultations and engagement on various issues, such as security cooperation and trade. The United States will invest $165 million over five years in programs to facilitate the exchange of expertise and understanding in higher education. Additionally, the U.S. will provide $136 million over three years for environmental and climate change cooperation, including support for programs in science, oceans, land use, and clean energy development. The United States will also support the establishment of a Climate Change Center in Indonesia.
