Long Beach Mayor Bob Foster supports the Middle Class Tax Cut Framework, stating that the constant political debate negatively affects private sector hiring decisions. Although the framework is not perfect, it cuts taxes for workers and provides investment incentives for businesses. Foster believes that this agreement will give money back to taxpayers and provide certainty for businesses, leading to increased hiring and growth in 2011. Foster is the Western Chair of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors and the former President of Southern California Edison. The City of Long Beach is home to the Port of Long Beach, part of the nation's largest port complex.
