During a press briefing, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest announced that President Obama will be going on a bus tour through New York and Pennsylvania to talk about his vision for ensuring a better bargain for the middle class. The President will discuss topics such as job creation, improving the housing market, and college affordability. Earnest mentioned that the average tuition at a public, four-year college has tripled over the last three decades, while family incomes have barely increased. He highlighted the importance of a college education in providing economic opportunity and mentioned that the federal government is doing more than ever to open up the door to a college education for middle-class families. However, government assistance is struggling to keep up with the skyrocketing costs of college education. The President believes that there is a need to fundamentally rethink and reshape the higher education system and will lay out some fundamental reforms during the bus tour. The specific reforms were not disclosed during the briefing. Earnest also addressed questions about the US aid to Egypt, stating that the aid relationship is under review but has not been cut off. He mentioned that assistance is provided episodically and evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The briefing also touched on other topics such as Syria, the situation in Egypt, and the NFL's Miami Dolphins.
