President Obama has outlined a plan to make college more affordable and accessible for all Americans. The plan includes several key proposals:

1. Reforming student aid: The President is proposing reforms to federal campus-based aid programs to shift aid away from colleges that fail to keep tuition down and towards those that provide good value and serve low-income students well. This will leverage $10 billion annually to keep tuition down.

2. Creating a Race to the Top for college affordability and completion: The President will invest $1 billion in a new challenge to states to spur higher education reform focused on affordability and improved outcomes. States will be incentivized to revamp state financing, align standards with K-12 education, and maintain adequate funding for higher education.

3. A first in the World competition to model innovation and quality: The President will invest $55 million in a competition to support colleges and organizations in developing breakthrough strategies to boost higher education attainment and student outcomes.

4. Better data for families to choose the right college: The President will create a College Scorecard for all degree-granting institutions, providing information on college costs, graduation rates, and potential earnings to help students and families make informed decisions.

5. Federal support to tackle college costs: The President has already made significant investments in student aid, and he is calling on Congress to keep interest rates low, double the number of work-study jobs, and make the American Opportunity Tax Credit permanent.

Overall, President Obama's plan emphasizes shared responsibility among the federal government, states, colleges, and universities to promote access and affordability in higher education.
