Three years ago, a mass shooting occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 14 students and three educators lost their lives. The families of the victims have experienced immense pain and loss, missing out on important milestones and wondering if things will ever be okay. This tragedy is not isolated, as gun violence affects communities across the United States, in various settings such as schools, churches, and shopping malls. The increase in homicides, particularly impacting Black and Brown individuals, has added to the number of empty seats at kitchen tables. The Parkland families have shown resilience by turning their grief into purpose, advocating for change through marches and organizing. The youth affected by gun violence, including the Parkland students, represent a long history of young people challenging the status quo to demand a safer future. The current administration is committed to taking action to end gun violence, calling on Congress to enact gun law reforms such as universal background checks, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and holding gun manufacturers accountable. The time to act is now, in honor of those lost and those left behind to grieve.
