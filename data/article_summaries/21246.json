The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a stat sheet from the Council of Economic Advisers highlighting the recent performance of the farm sector and rural economy. The sheet emphasizes progress made over the last five years and how the Agricultural Act of 2014, also known as the Farm Bill, will further build on that progress. The President will be visiting East Lansing, Michigan to deliver remarks on the importance of the Farm Bill to America's economy and will sign the bill at Michigan State University.
