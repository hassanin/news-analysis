President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for the La Jolla Band of Luise√±o Indians to assist with disaster recovery efforts. The funding will be allocated for Public Assistance projects related to severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred in February 2019. Previously, federal funding was available at 75% of eligible costs, but this has now been increased to 90% under the President's order. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
