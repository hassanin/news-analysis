The White House is urging Congress to provide emergency funding to combat the Zika virus. The President has requested $1.9 billion in funding, but Congress has not yet acted on this request. The White House is concerned that Congress has not taken the threat of Zika seriously enough, and that the funding is needed urgently to protect pregnant women and their babies. The White House has also expressed concern about the timing of Congress' response, as they expect transmission of Zika from mosquitoes to begin in June or July. The White House is calling on Congress to act quickly and provide necessary funding to address the Zika virus.
