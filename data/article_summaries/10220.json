On February 27, 2009, the White House released a memorandum announcing the transfer of detainee Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri from the control of the Secretary of Defense to the control of the Attorney General. This decision was made based on information provided by the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General, as well as their joint recommendation. The purpose of the transfer was to facilitate criminal proceedings against al-Marri. The memorandum supersedes a previous directive from June 23, 2003, that ordered al-Marri's detention as an enemy combatant. Upon the transfer to the Attorney General's control, the authority to detain al-Marri previously granted to the Secretary of Defense shall cease.
