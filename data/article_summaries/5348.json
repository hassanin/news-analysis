President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed March 6-12, 2022, as National Consumer Protection Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of consumer rights and raising awareness about deceptive practices in the marketplace. The administration is committed to protecting consumers from fraud and unlawful business practices, particularly during times of crisis like the ongoing pandemic. Consumer protection agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, work with law enforcement agencies to fight fraud and data exploitation. The harmful impact of abusive practices on communities of color is highlighted, and efforts are being made to address racial disparities in access to loans and credit. The administration aims to create an environment that protects and educates American consumers and communities.
