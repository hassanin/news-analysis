On March 26, 2018, senior administration officials held a press briefing to discuss the expulsion of Russian intelligence officers from the United States and the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle. The officials stated that these actions were in response to Russia's use of a military-grade chemical weapon in the United Kingdom and its ongoing pattern of destabilizing activities around the world. The United States and its allies are taking these steps to reduce Russia's ability to spy on Americans and conduct covert operations. The officials emphasized that the United States is open to improving relations with Russia, but only if there is a change in the Russian government's behavior. The briefing also addressed questions about the number of individuals being expelled, the closure of the consulate in Seattle, and the potential response from Russia.
