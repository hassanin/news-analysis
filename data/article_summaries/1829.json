President Biden will sign a proclamation establishing the Castner Range National Monument in El Paso, Texas. This action aims to protect the cultural, scientific, and historic objects within the monument, honor veterans and Tribal Nations, and expand access to outdoor recreation. Castner Range served as a training and testing site for the U.S. Army during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The area will be remediated for public access, offering unique opportunities for the El Paso community. President Biden is committed to expanding access to nature for underserved communities. The designation of Castner Range National Monument connects it with the Franklin Mountains State Park, creating continuous habitat for wildlife and improving public access for outdoor recreation. The area also contains significant cultural sites related to Tribal Nations. Additionally, President Biden will announce the establishment of the Avi Kwa Ame National Monument in Nevada and direct the Secretary of Commerce to consider protecting all U.S. waters around the Pacific Remote Islands. These actions are part of President Biden's commitment to conservation and restoration efforts across the nation.
