The Vice President, Joe Biden, expresses his sadness over the passing of Samuel Pisar, the step-father of Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken. Pisar overcame a difficult childhood in the Holocaust and postwar Europe to become an advisor to President John F. Kennedy and a friend to French Presidents Francois Mitterrand and Valery Giscard dâ€™Estaing. He was known for his courage in speaking about his Holocaust experience and his memoir, "Of Blood and Hope," is recommended reading. Pisar's dedication to public service and his influence on his children, including Tony Blinken, is acknowledged and appreciated.
