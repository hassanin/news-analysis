The White House has launched the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge, in which 25 higher education institutions have committed to reducing barriers for individuals with criminal records to access higher education. The pledge includes adopting fair chance admissions practices, providing support for professors and students teaching in correctional facilities, and offering internships and job training for individuals with criminal records. This initiative is part of the Obama Administration's efforts to reform the criminal justice system and expand college opportunities. The Department of Education has also released a resource guide to help colleges and universities remove barriers for citizens with criminal records. Additionally, the White House launched the Fair Chance Business Pledge earlier this year, which calls on private sector organizations to eliminate barriers in employment for individuals with criminal records. Over 100 organizations, including American Airlines, Google, and Starbucks, have joined the pledge.
