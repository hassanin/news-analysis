President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism, which was declared in Executive Order 13224 in 2001, will continue beyond September 23, 2023. The President cites the ongoing crisis posed by acts of terrorism, including the September 11, 2001 attacks, as well as the immediate threat of further attacks, as reasons for the continuation of the national emergency. President Biden believes that this crisis still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
