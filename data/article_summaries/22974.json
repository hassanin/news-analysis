The article is a message from President Barack Obama to the Senate regarding the ratification of the Protocol Amending the Convention between the United States of America and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion With Respect to Taxes on Income. The proposed Protocol aims to eliminate withholding taxes on certain cross-border direct dividend payments and cross-border interest payments to certain financial enterprises. It also reduces the existing Convention's limit on withholding taxes on cross-border payments of royalties. Additionally, the proposed Protocol includes provisions to prevent "treaty shopping" and facilitate the exchange of information between tax authorities of the two countries. President Obama recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the proposed Protocol and consent to its ratification.
