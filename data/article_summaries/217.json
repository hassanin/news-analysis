Today, on World Suicide Prevention Day, President Joe Biden proclaims September 10, 2021, as a day to remember those lost to suicide and to commit to preventing suicide across America. Suicide is a significant issue in the United States, with millions of Americans considering suicide, especially among young people, LGBTQ+ individuals, and Native American youth. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated feelings of isolation and mental health struggles, leading to increased rates of depression and concerns about rising suicide rates. The President emphasizes the need to provide mental health services and support to prevent suicide, particularly for veterans and active military service members. The administration has allocated funding for suicide prevention programs, including those targeting youth. Efforts are also being made to expand access to mental health and substance use treatment, address risk factors such as job loss and financial problems, and address suicide by firearm through the implementation of red flag laws. The President urges those struggling with thoughts of suicide to seek help through hotlines and crisis lines, and emphasizes the importance of creating hope through action in preventing suicide.
