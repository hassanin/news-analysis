Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton held a gaggle aboard Air Force One en route to Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. He provided some details about the event, including the number of attendees and how tickets were distributed. He also mentioned that the President will be introduced by a woman named Leslie Banks, who wrote to the President about her issues with health care. 

When asked about the purpose of the President's trips to Pennsylvania and Missouri, Burton explained that the President wants to make the urgency of the health care issue clear to the American people. He emphasized that rising health care costs are hurting businesses, families, and local governments, and highlighted the profit-driven decisions of health insurance companies.

Burton also mentioned that the President will have a meeting with Senator Schumer and Senator Graham later that day to discuss bipartisan immigration legislation. When asked about the President's upcoming meeting with the Greek Prime Minister, Burton said there will be more information later but noted that economic issues will be an important part of the discussion.

Regarding the Federal Reserve appointees, Burton said that there is no new update but the goal is to have an appointment before June. He also mentioned that the President receives regular updates on detainments and the fight against extremists worldwide.

When asked about future stops on the health care tour, Burton replied, "Stay tuned." He also addressed the use of images of the President as a Joker by the RNC, saying that it is up to the Republican leadership to decide if they think it is appropriate.
