The administration wants to hold families together, but the current system makes it difficult to do so. The article suggests that Congress should act quickly to address this issue and find a solution that allows families to be held together while their asylum claims are adjudicated. It also mentions that if families are released together, it creates an incentive for more migrants to make the dangerous journey to the border. The article concludes by stating that Congress has the power to address this problem and should do so promptly.
