President Biden will issue an Executive Order on Strengthening Access to Affordable, High-Quality Contraception and Family Planning Services. This is the third Executive Order on reproductive health care access that the President has signed since the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. The order focuses specifically on protecting and expanding access to contraception. The President will announce actions to further enhance access to contraception. The Biden-Harris Administration has already taken steps to protect access to contraception in response to two prior Executive Orders.
