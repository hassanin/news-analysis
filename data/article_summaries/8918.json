President Biden addressed the nation from the Roosevelt Room, sharing positive news about the economy. He stated that the latest report showed a decrease in inflation, which is a reason for optimism. Although prices are still high, progress is being made. Gas prices have fallen, providing relief for consumers. Food inflation has also slowed down, offering much-needed relief for families. President Biden emphasized that his economic plan is working, with the addition of 10.5 million new jobs during his presidency, including 750,000 manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate has decreased to 3.7 percent, near a 50-year low. The federal deficit has been lowered by $1.7 trillion, and prices of various goods, including televisions, toys, and used cars, have gone down. Wages have increased more than prices, and historic investments are being made in advanced manufacturing, creating good-paying jobs. President Biden's plan includes actions to lower prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums, and energy bills. Starting in January, seniors with diabetes on Medicare will only have to pay $35 a month for insulin, down from an average of $400. President Biden expressed his optimism about America's future and the progress being made, and he believes that prices will continue to decrease, although he cannot predict when they will return to normal.
