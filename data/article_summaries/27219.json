In this op-ed, Eric D. Hargan, Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, discusses the burden of drug addiction on smaller cities and towns. He shares his personal experience growing up in Mounds, Illinois, a small farming community where opioid addiction and substance abuse have been prevalent for decades. Hargan emphasizes that the opioid crisis is a nationwide issue and that under President Donald Trump, HHS has made it a top priority. They have been working to address overdoses and opioid-use disorder in rural areas, as well as across the country. Hargan states that approximately 116 American lives were claimed by the opioid crisis every day in 2016. The full op-ed can be read in the Duluth News Tribune.
