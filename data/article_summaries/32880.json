The article discusses the perspective of civil rights icon Barbara Jordan on immigration policy. Jordan believed that managing immigration in a way that serves the national interest is both a right and responsibility of a democratic society. She emphasized the importance of putting American citizens first and advocated for common-sense reforms to protect their rights and needs. Jordan called for an end to chain migration and the implementation of an electronic employment verification system. The article also mentions that the current administration has adopted an America First approach to immigration, resulting in decreased illegal immigration and increased opportunities for American workers. The administration is hopeful that both Republicans and Democrats in Congress will work together to pass legislation that secures the southern border, stops chain migration, and ends the visa lottery program. This, according to the article, would serve American interests, strengthen the economy, and preserve the American Dream for future generations.
