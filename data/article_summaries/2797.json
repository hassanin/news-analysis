The article highlights two contrasting aspects of the current economic situation. On one hand, the jobs recovery in the US remains strong, with low unemployment claims, record job creation, and private sector job growth. On the other hand, inflation is becoming a concern, with Americans feeling the impact of price increases, particularly in gas and energy prices due to Putin's aggressive actions. The article emphasizes that while there may be costs at home due to sanctions imposed on Putin, the costs inflicted on him and his associates are more devastating. The administration is taking steps to address rising prices by releasing oil reserves, promoting domestic manufacturing, strengthening supply chains, and advocating for fair prices and lower costs of essentials like prescription drugs and energy. Additionally, the article mentions that the federal budget deficit inherited from the previous administration is being reduced, with projections indicating a reduction of over $1 trillion this year, the largest one-year reduction in US history.
