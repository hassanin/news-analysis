Today, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki held a press briefing in which she introduced Chair Cecilia Rouse and member Heather Boushey from the Council of Economic Advisers. The briefing focused on Equal Pay Day and the gender wage gap in the United States. Chair Rouse and member Boushey spoke about the disparities in pay between men and women, particularly for women of color, and highlighted the importance of passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, providing paid family and medical leave, making childcare more affordable, and increasing wages for workers in the care economy. They also mentioned the American Rescue Plan and its provisions to support women and families, such as the increased Child Tax Credit and expanded childcare assistance. Psaki also addressed questions about the Federal Reserve's role in closing racial economic gaps and the administration's plans to address educational attainment and the wage gap. Other topics discussed during the briefing included gun control, the border situation, and infrastructure plans.
