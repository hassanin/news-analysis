President Obama has congratulated the Libyan people on their recent elections for a new Council of Representatives, which marks a significant step towards transitioning from dictatorship to democracy. However, he acknowledges that elections are just one part of the broader democratic process in Libya. The new government must now focus on establishing security, providing public services, and ensuring an inclusive political process. The United States calls on all parties to renounce violence and resolve differences through political dialogue and participation in the democratic process. The US remains committed to supporting the Libyan people during this challenging yet historic time.
