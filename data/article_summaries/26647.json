The U.S. manufacturing sector has seen improvement over the past year due to global economic growth, increased business confidence, and rising energy and commodity prices. Since Donald Trump was elected president in November 2016, the sector has added 156,000 workers. Business investment has also risen, indicating companies are spending to increase productivity. Global energy and commodity prices have rebounded, benefiting manufacturers like Caterpillar Inc. who produce heavy machinery used in resource extraction. The optimism in the sector is partly attributed to Trump's election and his promises of reduced taxes and regulations. Many business leaders remain hopeful that Trump will deliver on infrastructure spending and trade measures that benefit domestic manufacturers. The Trump administration's efforts to roll back federal regulations have been seen as positive for the manufacturing sector in the long term. Overall, there is a sense that it is a favorable time for the manufacturing industry.
