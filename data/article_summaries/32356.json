President Trump announced more results from his Administration's deregulatory efforts, with the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimating that 20 deregulatory actions will save U.S. consumers and businesses over $220 billion per year. The deregulation program is projected to boost household incomes by upwards of $3,100 annually in the future. These benefits include access to cheaper cars, savings on prescription drugs, and a greater impact on blue-collar and middle-class Americans. Lower-income families are disproportionately affected by overregulation, as they spend a larger share of their incomes on heavily regulated goods and services. President Trump has kept his promise of rolling back regulations, with nearly eight regulations being rolled back for each new one implemented under his administration. The CEA estimates that cutting red tape will lead to a rise in real incomes for Americans by $53 billion per year between 2021 and 2029. The focus is on creating an efficient and effective government that protects its citizens while creating jobs for workers across the country.
