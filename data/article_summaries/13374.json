President Obama met with Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Sloan D. Gibson and Rob Nabors to discuss the progress in improving care for veterans through the VA health care system. They reported on the reforms being implemented and the site visits they made to VA medical facilities across the country. While acknowledging the dedication of VA employees, they emphasized the need for further action to address systemic problems. Rob Nabors presented his findings from a review of the Veterans Health Administration's approach to access to care. The President asked him to stay at the VA temporarily to continue assisting during the transition. Since the review began, VA has completed a nationwide Access Audit and taken steps to improve access to care and address systemic issues. These include outreach to veterans, scheduling additional appointments, training schedulers, and allocating funds. VA has also made specific improvements at challenged facilities and increased transparency by posting access data updates online. Acting Secretary Gibson has expressed support for whistleblowers and ordered a comprehensive review of the Office of Medical Inspector's operation.
