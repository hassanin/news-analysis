In a recent speech, President Trump addressed the ongoing government shutdown and the immigration crisis at the southern border. He emphasized the need for urgent action to address the humanitarian and security issues at the border, including the exploitation of children, drug trafficking, and illegal immigration. The President proposed a compromise plan that includes $5.7 billion for a steel barrier in high-priority locations, additional border agents, immigration judge teams, and measures to protect migrant children. He also offered three years of legislative relief for DACA recipients and a three-year extension of Temporary Protected Status. The President called for bipartisan cooperation and expressed his commitment to finding a long-term solution to the immigration problem.
