President Biden has announced a new rule aimed at improving mental health care access and strengthening mental and physical health parity requirements for over 150 million Americans. Despite bipartisan efforts over the years, many Americans still struggle to find and afford the mental health care they need. Research shows that people with private health coverage have difficulty finding mental health providers in their network, often resulting in seeking out-of-network care at higher costs. The proposed rule aims to address these issues by improving access to in-network mental health care and eliminating barriers to treatment. It also seeks to increase utilization of mental health and substance use care and ensure comparable payment for mental health professionals. The administration also intends to work with states to ensure compliance with mental health parity requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries. These actions are part of President Biden's broader strategy to transform mental health care in the country.
