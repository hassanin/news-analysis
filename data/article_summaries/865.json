During a teleconference, Vice President Kamala Harris discussed the maternal mortality crisis in the United States. She highlighted the fact that women in the country are dying from pregnancy-related causes at a higher rate than any other developed nation, with black women being three times more likely to be affected and Native women twice as likely. The administration has taken action to address this issue, including hosting the first-ever White House Maternal Health Day of Action and calling on states to extend Medicaid coverage for postpartum women from 2 months to 12 months. The Vice President announced that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will expand coverage in Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Washington, D.C., providing 235,000 women with 12 months of critical postpartum coverage. The administration will continue to fight until every state has expanded Medicaid coverage and prioritize the right for all women to have access to full reproductive healthcare. Harris emphasized the importance of working with partners at the state, local, community-based, and nonprofit levels to ensure that every woman has the healthcare she needs to thrive.
