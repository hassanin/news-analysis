The article is a statement from the President regarding the passage of statutory pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) into law by the House of Representatives. The President expresses satisfaction with this development, stating that statutory PAYGO will ensure that Congress can only spend a dollar if it saves a dollar elsewhere. The President emphasizes that mandatory spending increases and tax cuts must be paid for, as they are not free, and borrowing to finance them is not a sustainable long-term policy. The President also highlights the positive impact of statutory PAYGO in the 1990s, when deficits were turned into surpluses. The passage of statutory PAYGO is seen as a step towards ending irresponsibility and returning the country to a fiscally sustainable path.
