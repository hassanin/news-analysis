The article is a memorandum written by Barack Obama on January 22, 2009, titled "Review of the Detention of Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri." In the memorandum, Obama discusses the signing of an Executive Order that mandates a review of the status of individuals currently detained at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base. However, the memorandum focuses specifically on Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, who has been held as an enemy combatant within the United States for over five years. While al-Marri is not covered by the review at Guantánamo Bay, Obama emphasizes the need for a prompt and thorough review of al-Marri's detention, including evaluating alternative dispositions. The memorandum directs the Attorney General to coordinate the review, involving various government officials and employees with relevant expertise. Obama concludes by stating that the memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
