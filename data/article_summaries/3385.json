Chief of Staff Jeff Zients hosted an Investing in America Cabinet meeting, where President Biden thanked members of his Cabinet and Administration for implementing his economic agenda. The meeting discussed the impact of legislative successes, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the American Rescue Plan. The Administration highlighted achievements like new private sector investments in manufacturing and clean energy, funding for infrastructure projects, and expanding high-speed internet access. The discussion also addressed the potential consequences of repealing the Inflation Reduction Act and cutting funding for manufacturing and research. The Investing in America tour involves visits to 25 states, including Puerto Rico, to promote the administration's economic agenda.
