The UN has successfully unloaded over one million barrels of crude oil from the FSO Safer, a deteriorating supertanker off the coast of Yemen. This operation, funded by an international coalition spearheaded by the US, has prevented a potential oil spill that would have had severe environmental, economic, and humanitarian consequences. The Safer was previously used as an offshore terminal for Yemeni oil exports but has been neglected since 2014 due to the Yemen conflict. The UN Resident Coordinator for Yemen and the UN Development Programme played vital roles in the mission's success. However, additional funds are needed to address any remaining environmental threats.
