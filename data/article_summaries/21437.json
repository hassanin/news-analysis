Vice President Joe Biden wrote an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times discussing the administration's Nuclear Posture Review, which outlines a comprehensive strategy for achieving greater security from nuclear dangers. He highlights the shift in focus from the threat of deliberate nuclear war between nations to the dangers posed by nuclear terrorism and the spread of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear states. The strategy takes nonproliferation and counter-terrorism into account when making decisions about the number and deployment of nuclear weapons. The review calls for a 30% reduction in the nuclear arsenal, as advances in conventional capabilities and technologies like missile defense have made fewer weapons necessary for deterrence. The plan also states that the United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states that are party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and in compliance with their obligations. The op-ed emphasizes the importance of ensuring the safety, security, and effectiveness of the nuclear arsenal, with the President requesting increased funding for the nuclear complex to upgrade facilities and retain skilled scientists and engineers. The strategy also upholds the moratorium on nuclear tests and supports efforts to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The op-ed concludes by stating that the strategy delivers on the promise to protect the American people from nuclear risks and addresses the most immediate threats faced by the world.
