Second Lady Karen Pence recently delivered remarks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Hiring our Heroes event in Tampa, Florida. The event showcased the release of a report called "A Collective Effort: Workforce Development Solutions for the 21st Century Military Spouse," which focuses on identifying best practices, challenges, and solutions in workforce development for military spouses. The report comes after extensive research conducted over the course of a year. Currently, military spouses face a 24% unemployment rate and typically move every 2 to 3 years. Second Lady Karen Pence recognizes these unique challenges and has collaborated with Hiring Our Heroes to find ways for states, businesses, and the federal government to work together in employing and retaining military spouses. She emphasized that employers who hire military spouses benefit from their talent and experience. Hiring Our Heroes is an initiative launched by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation in 2011, aiming to connect veterans, service members, and military spouses with meaningful employment opportunities. Through partnerships with various sectors, the initiative seeks to create a movement across America to support veterans and military families in their communities.
