President Obama celebrated the implementation of the Post 9/11 GI Bill, which provides educational benefits to service members. The bill includes the Yellow Ribbon Program, which funds tuition expenses exceeding the highest public in-state undergraduate tuition rate. Over 3,400 agreements were received from the 1,100 participating schools. The maximum benefit allows veterans and service members to receive an in-state, undergraduate education at a public institution at no cost. Unused benefits can also be transferred to eligible career service members' families. The VA has processed over 112,000 claims since the signing of the bill.
