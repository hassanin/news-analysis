In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims October 3, 2011, as Child Health Day. He emphasizes the importance of providing children with quality healthcare, healthy food, clean environments, and safe schools and communities. The Affordable Care Act has allowed young adults to stay on their parents' insurance plan until they turn 26, resulting in approximately one million more individuals having insurance coverage. The Act also prohibits health insurance companies from denying coverage to children based on pre-existing conditions. The First Lady's Let's Move! Initiative encourages healthy habits at home and school, with over 1,250 schools meeting the HealthierUS School Challenge and thousands of child care providers adopting healthier practices. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act improves school lunches, and a redesigned food pyramid called MyPlate promotes better eating. The White House Conference on Bullying Prevention was held to address the issue of children feeling unsafe or afraid at school or in their community. Efforts have also been made to provide cleaner air and drinking water and reduce children's exposure to lead dust. The American Jobs Act proposes investments in school repairs and updates to ensure safer school buildings. Overall, Child Health Day serves as a reminder to prioritize the health and well-being of future generations.
