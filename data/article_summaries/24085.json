President Barack Obama has issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency in response to the situation in Burundi. The order aims to address the threat to US national security and foreign policy posed by the ongoing violence, political repression, and human rights abuses in the country. It imposes sanctions by blocking the property and interests in property of individuals and entities involved in actions or policies that threaten peace, security, or stability in Burundi, undermine democratic processes, commit human rights abuses, target civilians, obstruct humanitarian assistance, or attack international security presences. The order also suspends entry into the United States for individuals meeting the criteria outlined. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, has been delegated the authority to implement the order. All executive agencies are directed to take appropriate measures to carry out its provisions.
