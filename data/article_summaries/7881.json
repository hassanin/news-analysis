Ten years ago, the author recalls being present in the Situation Room with President Obama and the national security team as they watched the military bring justice to Osama bin Laden. This moment left a lasting impression on the author, highlighting the dedication of the intelligence professionals who tracked him down, the conviction of President Obama in making the call, and the courage and skill of the team on the ground. The author emphasizes that this operation was a fulfillment of the promise to never forget the lives lost on 9/11 and to ensure the safety of the American people. As the United States draws down its troops from Afghanistan, al Qaeda has been greatly degraded in the region. However, the threat from terrorist groups worldwide remains, and the United States will continue to monitor and disrupt any emerging threats from Afghanistan. The author expresses gratitude to the service members who carried out the raid and the government officials who contributed to its success. They also acknowledge the ongoing work of military personnel, intelligence and counterterrorism professionals, and others in keeping the American people safe today.
