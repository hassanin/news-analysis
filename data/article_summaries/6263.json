The article is about Presidential Determination No. 2023-06, which focuses on the importance of ensuring a robust and sustainable domestic industrial base for national defense. The determination states that printed circuit boards and advanced packaging, along with their components and manufacturing systems, are essential to national defense. Without presidential action, the United States industry cannot be expected to provide these capabilities in a timely manner. The article also mentions that purchases or commitments made under the Defense Production Act are the most practical and cost-effective way to meet this need. Additionally, the determination waives certain requirements of the Act to expand domestic production capability for printed circuit boards and advanced packaging, as it is necessary to prevent a shortfall that could severely impair national defense capability. The determination is authorized to be published in the Federal Register.
