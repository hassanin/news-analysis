The United States has expressed concern over the recent clashes along the border of Sudan and South Sudan. Both sides have been urged to show restraint and proceed with planned meetings to address security and border management issues. The statement emphasizes the importance of direct contact and negotiations to avoid further fighting and achieve economic cooperation and peace. The US also calls on armed movements in Darfur and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North to cooperate in restoring peace. The priority should be achieving humanitarian access and protecting the civilian population in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile.
