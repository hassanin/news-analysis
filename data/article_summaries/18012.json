President Barack Obama has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to Cuba, which was declared in 1996, will continue beyond March 1, 2014. This emergency was declared in response to the Government of Cuba's destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace in 1996.
