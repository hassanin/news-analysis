The White House is displaying a DÃ­a de los Muertos ofrenda for the third year in a row to honor and celebrate loved ones who have passed away. First Lady Jill Biden welcomed members of the Latino community for a special White House tour and invited guests to add a photo of a loved one to the display. This is the first time the ofrenda is available for public viewing on the White House tour. In previous years, Dr. Biden collaborated with the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago to display an ofrenda in the West Garden Room. Photos of the display can be found on the @FLOTUS and @LaCasaBlanca accounts.
