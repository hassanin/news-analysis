On January 23, 2017, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum revoking the previous Presidential Memorandum of January 23, 2009, regarding the Mexico City Policy. This policy, also known as the "Global Gag Rule," restricts funding for international organizations that provide or promote abortion services. President Trump reinstated the previous memorandum from January 22, 2001, which restores the Mexico City Policy. The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, is directed to implement a plan to extend the requirements of the reinstated memorandum to global health assistance provided by all departments or agencies. The Secretary of State is also instructed to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. It should be noted that this memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. The Secretary of State is authorized to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
