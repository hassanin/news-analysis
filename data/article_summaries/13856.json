President Obama released a statement on the passing of John Glenn, stating that when Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962, he lifted the hopes of the nation. Glenn's life was filled with breaking barriers, from his service in the military to setting records and becoming the oldest person to touch the stars at the age of 77. He was an inspiration to scientists, engineers, and astronauts, and his legacy will continue to inspire future generations. Glenn also represented Ohio in the U.S. Senate and fought to keep America a leader in science and technology. The President's thoughts are with Glenn's family, and he concludes by saying that Glenn's example compels us to keep reaching for the heavens.
