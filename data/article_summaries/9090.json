The Biden-Harris Administration has announced record contract spending on small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) and new steps to create contracting opportunities for disadvantaged businesses through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The administration aims to increase the share of federal contracts going to SDBs to 15% by 2025, which would be a 50% increase from current levels. The U.S. Small Business Administration's annual Small Business Procurement Scorecard for Fiscal Year 2021 shows a record level of federal contracting dollars awarded to SDBs. The administration is also taking steps to expand contracting opportunities for historically disadvantaged businesses, including those owned by women and people of color, under federal grants created through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Increasing contracting opportunities with underserved businesses helps narrow wealth disparities and promotes economic inclusion. The administration will continue to take actions to expand access to capital, support underserved businesses in the procurement process, and promote business diversity.
