Fifty-six years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law, surrounded by activists and leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, John Lewis, and Rosa Parks. This act is considered one of the most significant pieces of legislation in American history. It led to a significant increase in Black voter registration in the years following its passage, particularly in southern states. However, in recent years, voting rights have come under attack once again. Supreme Court decisions have weakened the Voting Rights Act, allowing states to pass laws that make it harder for Americans to vote, such as limiting vote-by-mail and early voting. In response, there are currently two important federal bills in Congress: the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The current administration fully supports these bills, recognizing the critical moment we are in. While the fight for voting rights has never been easy, each generation has fought to expand them, and it is our responsibility to continue that fight for every American's right to vote and have their vote counted.
