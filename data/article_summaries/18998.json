The Press Secretary criticizes Senator DeMint for wanting to waste 12 hours reading the text of the New START Treaty, which has already been available to the Senate and the public for over eight months. The Treaty has been extensively reviewed and supported by various Republican officials, NATO allies, and the US military. The Press Secretary argues that every minute spent reading the treaty delays the verification of Russia's nuclear arsenal and accuses those complaining about the lack of time to consider the Treaty of hypocrisy.
