Senior administration officials traveled to the Southwest border to visit a Department of Homeland Security Border Patrol facility and a Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement facility. They received operational briefings, updates, and tours of the facilities, and discussed capacity needs, challenges with rebuilding border infrastructure and immigration systems, and improvements needed to process and shelter unaccompanied children and families. The officials also discussed fair and humane treatment of immigrants, the safety of the workforce, and the wellbeing of nearby communities during the pandemic. They will brief the President on their trip.
