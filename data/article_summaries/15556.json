President Obama hosted a roundtable discussion in April 2009 about the impact of historically low interest rates on homeowners. The discussion included households who had refinanced their homes and benefited from lower mortgage payments, as well as members of President Obama's economic team. The Financial Stability Plan, specifically the Making Home Affordable program, aimed to stabilize the housing market and help 7 to 9 million Americans reduce their monthly mortgage payments through modifications or refinancing. Falling home prices and disruptions in credit markets had limited borrowers' ability to refinance, so the new program targeted borrowers with mortgages through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, even if their home had lost value. The article also provided biographies of participating homeowners who had successfully refinanced and reduced their monthly expenses.
