The article is a message from the President of the United States to the Senate regarding the New START Treaty with Russia. The President certifies that the United States has the necessary means to monitor Russian compliance with the treaty and to provide timely warning of any violations. The treaty does not require the US to provide telemetric information to Russia for missile defense purposes. The President intends to modernize the country's nuclear delivery systems and maintain the rocket motor industrial base. The US also plans to negotiate with Russia on reducing tactical nuclear weapons, excluding defensive missile systems. The President also intends to accelerate the design and engineering phase of certain facilities and request funding for their completion. The US will continue developing and deploying missile defense systems to defend against threats from countries like North Korea and Iran, while assuring that these systems do not threaten the strategic balance with Russia. A report on the sixth condition of the Resolution will be provided to the Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations separately.
