President Donald Trump has sent a letter to Congress stating his intention to enter into a trade agreement with Mexico and potentially Canada. The negotiations for this agreement began on August 16, 2017, and in just one year, significant progress has been made. Trump believes that this agreement sets high standards for free, fair, and reciprocal trade and is a great deal for the American people. He intends to enter into the agreement by the end of November 2018 and looks forward to collaborating with Congress to develop legislation to approve and implement the agreement.
