President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed January 2023 as National Human Trafficking Prevention Month. In his statement, he emphasizes the importance of ending human trafficking, which has affected nearly 25 million people worldwide, particularly marginalized communities. The administration has released a National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking, focusing on prevention, prosecution of perpetrators, and support for survivors. Efforts include research on root causes, improving survivors' access to services, and expanding the recognition of Tribal courts' jurisdiction over non-Native sex traffickers. The Department of State and United States Agency for International Development are collaborating with global allies to detect human trafficking, provide support to victims, and increase accountability. President Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act to prevent goods made with forced labor in Xinjiang, China, from being imported to the United States. The voices of survivors, particularly those from marginalized groups, are being prioritized, and their dignity and respect are being ensured. The President calls on all Americans to learn about the signs of human trafficking and share the National Human Trafficking Hotline (1-888-373-7888) to report tips or seek help. The proclamation emphasizes the role of businesses, civil society organizations, communities of faith, families, and all Americans in preventing human trafficking and encourages appropriate programs and activities to observe the month.
