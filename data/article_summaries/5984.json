Senior Biden-Harris Administration officials recently held a listening session with labor leaders to discuss the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) for workers, unions, job quality, and the future of work. Union leaders expressed concerns about the risks AI poses to workers' jobs, health, privacy, and civil rights. They also discussed potential opportunities for AI to improve workers' lives when unions and workers collaborate with employers to develop solutions. White House principals emphasized the need for collaboration with unions to understand and mitigate the risks associated with AI. The session explored how AI tools are being deployed in the workplace, including tracking workers' pace of work and monitoring work quality, which can increase workplace stress. However, AI has also been used to support workers by monitoring and easing physical tasks. The discussion also touched on the implications of AI for workers' privacy, civil rights, autonomy, and the changing skills required by employers. Participants called for access to high-quality jobs that prioritize workers' health and well-being and for workers to be involved in decisions regarding AI deployment. This listening session is part of the Administration's ongoing effort to engage with various stakeholders on AI issues and promote responsible innovation while mitigating risks.
