President Biden has outlined a target of 50% electric vehicle (EV) sales share in 2030 as part of his Build Back Better Agenda. The President signed an Executive Order to make half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles. The order also initiates the development of long-term fuel efficiency and emissions standards. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) will address the previous administration's rollbacks of fuel efficiency and emissions standards. The coordinated notices of proposed rulemaking aim to deliver around $140 billion in net benefits over the life of the program and reduce carbon pollution. The President's plan includes investments in the domestic electric vehicle industry, strengthening American leadership in EV manufacturing, infrastructure, and innovation. The goal is to create good-paying union jobs, expand American manufacturing, and make EVs more affordable. The President also aims to lead in clean cars and trucks, outcompete China, and tackle the climate crisis.
