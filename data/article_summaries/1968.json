The United States, along with the G7 and the European Union, is imposing severe economic measures on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine. These measures include banning new investments in Russia, imposing financial sanctions on Russian banks and state-owned enterprises, and targeting Russian government officials and their family members. These actions are part of a larger effort to hold Russia accountable and generate increasing impact over time. The United States and its allies have already imposed the most impactful economic restrictions in history, causing Russia's GDP to contract and inflation to spike. As long as Russia continues its assault on Ukraine, the United States will stand with its allies in imposing additional costs. The specific actions announced include full blocking sanctions on Russia's largest financial institution, Sberbank, and largest private bank, Alfa Bank, prohibiting new investment in Russia, imposing full blocking sanctions on critical major state-owned enterprises, and imposing sanctions on Russian elites and their family members. The U.S. Treasury has also prohibited Russia from making debt payments with funds subject to U.S. jurisdiction. However, exemptions will be made to support essential humanitarian activities and sectors such as food, medicine, and telecommunications.
