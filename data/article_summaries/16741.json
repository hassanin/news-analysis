The President has announced new initiatives to boost American leadership in wireless broadband and technological innovation. These initiatives aim to accelerate job creation and ensure that American businesses and workers have the necessary infrastructure to compete in the 21st century economy. The White House has also released a report showing the progress made in expanding broadband access in recent years. Some of the initiatives include directing federal agencies to enhance the efficiency of their use of spectrum and increase collaboration with the private sector, investing $100 million in spectrum sharing and advanced communications, and hosting a Spectrum Technology Day to showcase advances in spectrum sharing. The goal is to provide more spectrum for wireless broadband providers and accommodate the increasing demand for wireless services and applications. These actions build on previous initiatives and commitments made by the Administration to promote American leadership in wireless innovation.
