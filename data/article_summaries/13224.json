Vice President Joe Biden met with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to discuss the implementation of the Minsk agreements and the need for Russia to stop supporting separatists in the Donbas region. They also talked about the recently agreed demilitarization along the line of contact, but expressed concern over the separatists' lack of access for OSCE monitors and Russia's continued deployment of troops and weapons in Ukraine. Additionally, they discussed the importance of strengthening regional energy security and domestic political developments in preparation for local Ukrainian elections in October.
