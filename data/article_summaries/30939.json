The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced the largest-ever annual funding for its High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program. Over $264 million will be distributed to 29 regional HIDTA Programs across the United States and its territories. The HIDTA Program aims to coordinate the efforts of federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners in disrupting and dismantling drug trafficking organizations. ONDCP Director James Carroll believes that this investment will help keep deadly drugs out of communities and save lives. In 2018, President Trump established a new HIDTA program in Alaska to combat emerging threats, completing the Administration's goal of providing funding to all 50 states through the program.
