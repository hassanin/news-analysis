President Trump signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, which aims to reduce the time it takes for veterans to receive a decision on their appeals for benefits claims. The legislation modernizes the appeals process and creates three lanes for appeals claims, thereby speeding up the process and providing veterans with the certainty they deserve. Various veterans service organizations, lawmakers, and government officials have praised the new law for addressing the unacceptable delays in the appeals process and ensuring justice for veterans and their families.
