The article discusses two bills that have been passed by the United States Congress. The first bill, H.R. 724, is called the "Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act." It makes it a federal crime to engage in animal crushing. The second bill, H.R. 2423, is called the "Women's Suffrage Centennial Commemorative Coin Act." This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to mint and issue coins to commemorate the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which granted women the right to vote.
