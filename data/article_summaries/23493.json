President Obama released a statement expressing his gratitude for Heather Zichal's service as his trusted advisor on energy and climate change. Zichal played a key role in crafting Obama's energy and climate change agenda during the 2008 campaign and throughout his presidency. She advocated for policies that reduce America's dependence on foreign oil, protect public health and the environment, and address the threat of global climate change. Zichal oversaw significant achievements in energy and climate change, such as implementing fuel economy standards, reducing mercury pollution, and supporting the growth of clean energy. Obama commended Zichal for showing that strengthening America's energy security can be achieved without sacrificing economic growth or environmental stewardship. He thanked her for her service and wished her the best in her future endeavors.
