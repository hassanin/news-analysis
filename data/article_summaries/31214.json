President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation on November 11, 2020, in honor of Veterans Day. The proclamation acknowledges the contributions and sacrifices made by America's veterans in defending the country and its values. It highlights the courage, fortitude, and selflessness of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen who have placed the lives and security of others before their own. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of caring for veterans and their families, particularly in terms of healthcare and economic prosperity. President Trump mentions the efforts made during his administration to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), including removing employees who were not providing proper care and signing the VA MISSION Act to give veterans the choice to receive timely care from providers in their own communities. The mental health and welfare of veterans are also addressed, with initiatives aimed at preventing veteran suicides and improving mental health care. The proclamation calls on all Americans, as well as federal, state, and local officials, to recognize and honor veterans through public ceremonies and private thoughts and prayers. It encourages the display of the U.S. flag and participation in patriotic activities. The proclamation concludes by emphasizing the immeasurable contribution and debt owed to every single one of the nation's veterans.
