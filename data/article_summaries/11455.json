On November 4, 2010, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13557, which outlined the order of succession within the Department of Justice. According to the order, in the event that the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, and any other designated officers are unable to perform their duties, the following officers will act as Attorney General: United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, United States Attorney for the District of Minnesota, and United States Attorney for the District of Arizona. The order also states that no individual serving in an acting capacity can act as Attorney General, and the President has the discretion to deviate from this order when designating an acting Attorney General. Additionally, the order revokes Executive Order 13481 issued on December 9, 2008. It is important to note that this order does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
