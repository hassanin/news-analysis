President Barack Obama has issued a veto message for S.J. Res. 22, a resolution that aims to nullify a rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army regarding the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act. The President argues that the rule is essential for protecting the nation's waters and keeping them clean. He claims that the rule is a result of extensive public involvement, years of work, and is consistent with decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Obama emphasizes the need to protect water resources for the health of communities and the success of businesses, agriculture, and energy development. He states that too many of the nation's waters have been left vulnerable to pollution from upstream sources, which affects the drinking water, recreation, and economic development of Americans. The President believes that clarifying the scope of the Clean Water Act is necessary to protect these resources and ensure public health. He opposes the resolution because it would hinder progress and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty and clarity needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water. Therefore, he is vetoing the resolution.
