In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. emphasizes the importance of how we treat and value our children, parents, and loved ones as a nation. He acknowledges that the cost of care in the country is too high and the pay for care workers is too low. Many Americans struggle to find affordable and high-quality care for themselves and their loved ones. Care workers, despite having demanding jobs, remain among the lowest-paid workers in the country. As a result, many Americans are forced to leave their own jobs to care for their loved ones. President Biden discusses the actions his administration has taken to address these issues, including signing the American Rescue Plan to help families afford child care and providing support to stabilize the child care sector during the pandemic. He also mentions the first-ever national Strategy to Support Family Caregivers, which outlines actions the federal government can take to support caregivers' health, well-being, and financial security. President Biden signed a historic Executive Order that calls for comprehensive actions to increase access to high-quality child care and long-term care, protect workers from exploitation, and more. The article concludes by recognizing and honoring the love and sacrifice of American caregivers and encouraging all Americans to reach out and thank them. President Biden proclaims November 2023 as National Family Caregivers Month.
