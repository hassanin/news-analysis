President Donald J. Trump has commuted the prison sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, a 57-year-old father of 10 children who was convicted of bank fraud in 2009. Rubashkin has served more than 8 years of his 27-year sentence, which many believe to be excessive compared to similar crimes. The commutation does not vacate his conviction, but it does leave in place a term of supervised release and a substantial restitution obligation. The decision to commute Rubashkin's sentence was based on support from Members of Congress and a broad cross-section of the legal community, including more than 100 former high-ranking Department of Justice officials and over 30 current Members of Congress.
