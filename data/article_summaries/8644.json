The Biden-Harris Administration has announced the White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities. This nationwide initiative calls on stakeholders from all sectors to make commitments to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases by 2030, while also addressing disparities. The Challenge builds on previous commitments made during the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in September 2022. The Administration will issue draft guidance to food manufacturers on using Dietary Guidance Statements on food labels and propose a rule to reduce sodium in the food supply. The Challenge encourages organizations and communities to make commitments in areas outlined in the National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. The President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition will collaborate with the Administration to cultivate commitments, and participants will be announced in the fall of 2023.
