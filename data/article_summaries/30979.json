President Donald J. Trump will award the Medal of Honor to then-First Lieutenant Garlin M. Conner for his actions during World War II. Conner, who will receive the award posthumously, demonstrated conspicuous gallantry and selfless service while serving as an intelligence officer. He placed himself in an exposed position to direct artillery fire onto the enemy and remained there for three hours, despite the enemy coming within five yards of his position. Conner's example of bravery and sacrifice will be commemorated at a ceremony at the White House, with his spouse and family in attendance. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who show extraordinary bravery and self-sacrifice above and beyond the call of duty.
