The Supreme Court decision on religious schools has been celebrated as it removes obstacles to better educational opportunities for all children. States can no longer use biased rules, known as Blaine Amendments, to exclude religious schools from public benefits. Laws that link public benefits to religious status are seen as hostile to religion, forcing people and institutions to censor their religious views and stigmatizing certain religions. The Trump Administration sees school choice as a civil rights issue and believes that no parent should be obligated to send their child to a failing school. President Donald J. Trump will continue to support school choice and defend the free exercise of religion.
