The President emphasized that this is one of the largest and most difficult airlifts in history, and the United States is the only country capable of projecting such power with precision. Over 18,000 people have been evacuated since July, including American citizens, permanent residents, SIV applicants, and their families. The U.S. government has also facilitated private charter flights for evacuation.

He acknowledged the heartbreaking scenes in Afghanistan and emphasized the need to complete the mission and end 20 years of American military action in the country.

He stated that efforts will be made to evacuate all American citizens and Afghan allies and acknowledged the danger and difficulty of the situation. The President expressed confidence in the ability to address terrorism threats and emphasized the need to focus on counterterrorism missions globally.

He also stated that rescue operations are being considered for Americans and Afghan allies stranded behind Taliban checkpoints.
