President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12947 with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process will continue beyond January 23, 2018. The crisis involving acts of violence committed by foreign terrorists who threaten the peace process has not been resolved, and terrorist groups continue to engage in activities that threaten the United States' interests in the region. President Trump has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency and the sanctions against these terrorists in order to respond to this ongoing threat.
