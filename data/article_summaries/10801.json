President Obama is set to designate the largest marine reserve in the world, which will be completely off-limits to commercial resource extraction, including commercial fishing. The Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument will be expanded six times its current size, resulting in 370,000 square nautical miles of protected area. This expansion aims to protect deep coral reefs, seamounts, and marine ecosystems that are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification. The expansion will also protect the habitat of various marine species, including sea turtles, marine mammals, and seabirds. Recreational and traditional fishing that aligns with conservation goals will still be permitted in the expanded monument. This proclamation is part of the President's commitment to protecting marine landscapes, similar to how he has protected mountains, rivers, and forests. The monument will be managed by the Departments of the Interior and Commerce, ensuring proper care and management.
