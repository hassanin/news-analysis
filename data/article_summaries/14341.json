President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring September 19-25, 2010, as National Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of education for the future of our children and the growth of the nation. Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the United States, and HSIs are crucial in providing access to higher education and job training for this community. HSIs play a significant role in attracting underrepresented Americans to fields such as science, technology, engineering, and math. The Obama administration has set a goal to have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020, and enhancing educational opportunities for Hispanics is vital to achieving this objective. The proclamation celebrates the contributions of over 200 HSIs across the country and calls upon public officials, educators, and the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the contributions of these institutions and their graduates.
