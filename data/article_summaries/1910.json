Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina, emphasizing the importance of high-speed internet access as a basic necessity in the 21st century. She highlighted the fact that millions of American households still do not have internet access, either due to affordability or lack of availability, particularly in rural communities. Harris discussed the administration's investment of $65 billion through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to connect every household in America with affordable and accessible high-speed internet. She also mentioned the Affordable Connectivity Program, which provides a $30 discount on internet bills for over 16 million working families each month. Additionally, the program offers a one-time discount of up to $100 for families to purchase devices such as laptops or tablets. Harris announced an investment of over $175 million to expand high-speed internet access and affordability at 61 HBCUs and minority-serving institutions. She emphasized the importance of these investments in providing opportunities for education, healthcare, and economic growth.
