President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in American Samoa and has ordered Federal assistance to supplement response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from Tropical Storm Gita. The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will coordinate all disaster relief efforts. The action aims to alleviate the hardships faced by the local population and provide assistance for emergency measures to save lives, protect property, and ensure public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide necessary equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. The Federal funding for emergency protective measures will be provided at 75 percent. Benigno Bern Ruiz has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
