The White House Press Secretary discussed the ongoing negotiations surrounding the debt ceiling and government shutdown. He mentioned that the President is happy that cooler heads seem to be prevailing in the House and that there is a recognition that default is not an option. However, the President believes it would be better for the Congress to raise the debt ceiling for an extended period of time to avoid episodic brinksmanship. The President is willing to sign a short-term debt ceiling bill, but he prefers a longer-term resolution. The Press Secretary also mentioned that the President is not willing to negotiate over the debt ceiling or the government shutdown and will not pay ransom in exchange for doing Congress's job. The President believes that Congress should turn on the lights and open the government, raise the debt ceiling, and then have a discussion about budget priorities. The Press Secretary also addressed concerns about the impact of the government shutdown on certain programs, such as the death gratuity for military families and funding for the NIH. He emphasized that the government should be reopened to avoid these negative consequences.
