President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in Florida and ordered federal assistance to supplement state and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions caused by Hurricane Michael. This action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts to alleviate the hardship and suffering of the local population. FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide necessary equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Debris removal and emergency protective measures will be provided at 75 percent federal funding in certain counties. Thomas J. McCool has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
