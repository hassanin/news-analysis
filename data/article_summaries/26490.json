President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Nebraska due to severe winter storms, straight-line winds, and flooding. This declaration allows federal funding to be provided to affected individuals and local governments for recovery efforts. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and businesses recover. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. Damage assessments are still ongoing, and additional areas may be designated for assistance in the future. For further information, contact the FEMA news desk.
