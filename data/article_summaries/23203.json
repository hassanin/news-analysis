On the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), the President issued a statement condemning the practice and highlighting efforts to combat it. The President emphasized that FGM/C harms entire communities and undermines efforts to empower women and girls. He rejected the notion that FGM/C is a rite of passage and stated that it is harmful and wrong wherever it occurs. The United States has taken action to combat FGM/C, including criminalizing the transport of girls for the procedure, raising awareness in immigrant communities, and providing grants for prevention strategies. The President called on individuals and communities to work together to end FGM/C and enable women and girls to reach their full potential.
