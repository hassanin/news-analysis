The American Jobs Plan is a proposal put forth by President Biden to invest in America's infrastructure, create jobs, and address long-standing racial and economic disparities. The plan aims to rebuild the country's crumbling infrastructure, deliver clean drinking water and high-speed broadband to all Americans, retrofit buildings for energy efficiency, upgrade schools and hospitals, and solidify the care economy by creating jobs and raising wages for essential home care workers. It also seeks to revitalize manufacturing, invest in research and development, and train Americans for future jobs. To fund these investments, President Biden is proposing a Made in America Tax Plan that will ensure corporations pay their fair share in taxes. The plan is estimated to cost about $2 trillion and will be paid for over the next 15 years.
