This article is a press gaggle from July 10, 2009, featuring Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Denis McDonough, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications. They discuss President Obama's meeting with the Holy Father and the topics they covered, including the encyclical released by the Holy Father, the situation in the Middle East, Cuba, Honduras, and the food security initiative. They also discuss the President's appreciation for Archbishop Rodriguez's role in the crisis in Honduras, as well as their shared goals of interfaith dialogue, countering militarism and extremism, immigration reform, and bioethics and abortion. The President delivered a letter from Senator Kennedy to the Holy Father and asked him to pray for Senator Kennedy. The duration of the meeting was around 30 minutes, and the President's family also had a chance to meet the Holy Father. The article concludes with some additional questions from reporters, including whether the Holy Father and the President prayed together and if the President received an invitation to the soccer World Cup in South Africa.
