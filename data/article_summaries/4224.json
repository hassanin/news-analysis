The Biden-Harris Administration has announced an extension of the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Cybersecurity Initiative to the water sector. This initiative aims to improve the cybersecurity of the water sector through surge actions outlined in the Water Sector Action Plan, which will be implemented over the next 100 days. The plan was developed in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Water Sector Coordinating Council (WSCC). The recent cyberattacks on critical infrastructure providers like Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods have highlighted the need for collaboration between the federal government, private sector, and municipal owners and operators to manage cybersecurity risks. The administration has already established ICS initiatives for the electric and natural gas pipeline subsectors, with over 150 electricity utilities and multiple critical natural gas pipelines deploying additional cybersecurity technologies. The Water Sector Action Plan aims to facilitate the deployment of technologies and systems that enhance cyber threat visibility and detection. This initiative underscores the importance of cybersecurity as a top economic and national security priority for the Biden-Harris Administration.
