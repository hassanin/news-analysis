The United States has welcomed the exchange of almost 900 prisoners in Yemen, which is being overseen by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). This prisoner exchange is the result of months of engagement and mediation by the UN's Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg. The US is proud to support this UN-led effort and will continue to help consolidate the truce that has been in effect for over a year. The past year in Yemen has been the quietest since the war began, allowing for increased humanitarian assistance, fuel imports, and civilian flights. The US encourages all parties to build on this positive development and work towards a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.
