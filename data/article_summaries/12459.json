President Obama has declared a major disaster in Missouri due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between December 23, 2015, and January 9, 2016. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. Assistance will include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid individuals and business owners in recovering from the disaster. Federal funding will also be available for hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Residents and business owners in the affected counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone.
