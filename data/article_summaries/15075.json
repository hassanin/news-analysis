The Government of Israel has proposed an independent public commission to investigate the events surrounding the flotilla incident. The United States supports this investigation and believes that Israel, like any other nation, should be allowed to investigate events involving its national security. Israel's military justice system is capable of conducting a serious and credible investigation. The structure and terms of reference of Israel's proposed commission meet the standard of a prompt, impartial, credible, and transparent investigation. The United States will not prejudge the process or its outcome and will await the conduct and findings of the investigation before drawing further conclusions. It is expected that Israel's commission and military investigation will be carried out promptly, and its findings will be presented publicly and to the international community.
