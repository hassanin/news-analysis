President Biden has signed an Executive Order that prohibits the operational use of commercial spyware by the United States Government. This is the first time such a prohibition has been put in place. Commercial spyware refers to cyber surveillance tools sold by vendors that allow remote access to electronic devices, extraction of their content, and manipulation of their components without the knowledge or consent of the users. The proliferation of commercial spyware poses significant counterintelligence and security risks to the United States, including threats to the safety of government personnel and their families. Many foreign governments have utilized this technology to facilitate repression and human rights abuses. The Executive Order aims to establish strong protections against the misuse of commercial spyware and will be a cornerstone initiative during the second Summit for Democracy. It demonstrates the United States' commitment to advancing technology for democracy and countering the misuse of surveillance technology. The Executive Order also seeks to promote responsible use of surveillance technology, counter its proliferation and misuse, and encourage industry reform. The order ensures that any use of commercial spyware by the U.S. Government aligns with national security, foreign policy interests, democratic processes, institutions, and human rights. The Biden-Harris Administration and Congress have taken concrete actions to confront the threat posed by the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware, aiming to reduce repression and human rights abuses, mitigate counterintelligence threats, prevent U.S. companies and former government personnel from facilitating authoritarian practices abroad, and provide tools for protection to Americans and civil society.
