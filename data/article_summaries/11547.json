President Obama has signed an Executive Order to protect veterans, service members, and their families from deceptive practices by educational institutions. The order aims to ensure that these individuals have the necessary information to make informed decisions about their education and are not targeted by aggressive recruiting tactics. It will require colleges to provide transparent information about outcomes and financial aid options, as well as establish rules for institutions' access to military installations. The order also addresses improper online recruiting practices and establishes a centralized complaint system for students receiving military and veterans' educational benefits. Additionally, colleges participating in military and veterans education benefit programs will be required to provide support services and better data on educational institutions will be developed. The order also strengthens enforcement and compliance functions to address complaints of improper activity.
