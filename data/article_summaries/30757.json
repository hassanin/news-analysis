In his weekly address, President Trump emphasizes the need for the government to make tough choices and spend on the safety, security, and well-being of the American people. He criticizes Washington for its failure to do so and states that his administration is working towards economic prosperity and achieving "American Greatness." The proposed budget aims to create millions of new jobs, balance the budget without cutting Social Security and Medicare, and prioritize economic growth, safety, and security. The budget also reverses previous cuts to the military and emphasizes the importance of keeping citizens safe and free. The President also mentions the need to provide resources for ICE officers and Border Patrol agents to end lawlessness and combat gangs like MS-13. He concludes by expressing his confidence in the budget's ability to provide a strong foundation for the future of America.
