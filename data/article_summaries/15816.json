President Barack Obama has proclaimed April 2, 2012, as World Autism Awareness Day. He recognizes autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) as a growing public health issue and commits to supporting individuals with ASDs and their families. The administration has made efforts to improve understanding and support for those with ASDs, including signing the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act to provide funding for research, education, and support services. The Affordable Care Act requires insurance plans to cover autism screenings and assessments for children, and young people can stay on their parents' health insurance plan until age 26. The Department of Education is investing in enhancing education for children on the autism spectrum, and federally funded research is exploring ways to improve independent living and vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with autism. President Obama encourages all Americans to learn more about autism and support individuals on the autism spectrum and their families.
