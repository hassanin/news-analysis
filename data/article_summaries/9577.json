Former Congressman Lane Evans, a proud veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, has passed away. He dedicated much of his public life to helping fellow veterans, especially those who served in Vietnam and were exposed to Agent Orange. President Obama expressed his deep sadness and recalled that Lane was one of his earliest supporters when he ran for the Senate. The President considered Lane an American hero, a dear friend, and a beloved public servant of Illinois. He extended his condolences to Lane's family, friends, and constituents.
