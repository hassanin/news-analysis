The White House has issued a Presidential Memorandum and accompanying report on the transparency of the United States' use of military force and related national security operations. The memorandum directs national security departments and agencies to prepare a report describing the legal and policy frameworks guiding these operations, with the aim of providing clear and public articulation of these frameworks. The report reflects the work of the Obama Administration over the past eight years to ensure that all national security operations are conducted within a legal and policy framework that is lawful, effective, and consistent with national interests and values. The report covers topics such as the legal basis for the use of military force, working with others in armed conflicts, and the conduct of hostilities. In addition, the Administration is making public two related documents: a 2012 Department of Justice Detention Policy Report and the 2009 Final Report by the Special Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies.
