The Vice President of the United States hosted a lunch meeting with leaders and officials from 11 countries in anticipation of the Nuclear Security Summit.

The Vice President emphasized the common interest among countries in ensuring the security of nuclear materials and strengthening international non-proliferation norms. Participants highlighted the close relationship between nuclear security and the development of nuclear energy. The Vice President stated that peaceful uses of nuclear energy can thrive in a world where nuclear dangers are constantly reduced and non-proliferation norms are respected and enforced.
