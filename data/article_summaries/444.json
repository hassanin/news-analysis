The United States is deeply concerned about the violent actions of the Burmese security forces against peaceful protestors. These killings signify an escalation in the ongoing crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators following the coup on February 1. The United States extends its sincere condolences to the families of the brave protestors who have lost their lives while peacefully advocating for democracy in Burma. The United States stands in solidarity with the people of Burma, who continue to courageously express their desires for democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. The U.S. will continue to work closely with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region and globally to hold those responsible for the violence accountable and demonstrate support for the people of Burma. Additionally, the U.S. is preparing further actions to impose consequences on those involved in the recent outbreak of violence and the coup. More details will be provided in the coming days.
