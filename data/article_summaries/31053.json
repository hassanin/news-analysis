They believe that expanding access to treatment and recovery efforts, as well as increasing law enforcement efforts, will help address the problem. They also appreciate the president's leadership and passion on this issue and are committed to working together to raise awareness and find ways to defeat the epidemic. Cabinet members and administration offices, such as the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services, are also committed to aggressively prosecuting drug traffickers and implementing bold actions to stop the crisis. Advocacy organizations, including the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials and the National Council for Behavioral Health, welcome the plan and believe it will strengthen the capacity of state health agencies to address the problem and increase access to effective treatment.
