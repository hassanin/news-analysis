President Trump has signed legislation to support Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and simplify the federal financial aid application process. This legislation provides permanent funding of over $2.5 billion over the next 10 years, including $850 million specifically for HBCUs. The bill also reforms the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by allowing the IRS to transfer applicants' records to the Department of Education, making the application process simpler and shorter. President Trump has expressed his commitment to HBCUs and their importance in serving minority students and communities.
