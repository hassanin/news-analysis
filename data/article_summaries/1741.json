President Biden has declared a major disaster in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands due to the impact of Typhoon Mawar. This declaration allows federal funding to supplement the recovery efforts of the commonwealth and local governments, as well as eligible nonprofit organizations. The funding will be used for emergency protective measures and direct federal assistance for the island of Rota. Mr. Benigno B. Ruiz of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are still ongoing, and further assistance may be designated once the assessments are completed. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
