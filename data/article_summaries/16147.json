President Barack Obama issued a presidential memorandum waiving the restriction on providing funds to the Palestinian Authority. The waiver was granted based on the importance to the national security interests of the United States. The memorandum directs the Secretary of State to transmit the determination to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register, along with a report as required by the relevant legislation.
