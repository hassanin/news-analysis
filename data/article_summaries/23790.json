President Obama will sign a Proclamation designating Fort Ord as a National Monument. Fort Ord, located on California's Central Coast, is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. The National Monument will protect the area's scenic landscapes and honor the veterans who served there. Over 100,000 people visit Fort Ord each year, benefiting tourism, recreation, and local businesses. The Antiquities Act, which allows for the designation of National Monuments, has been used by 16 presidents to protect unique natural and historic features in America. Fort Ord offers exceptional recreational opportunities, with 86 miles of trails for hiking, biking, and horseback riding. The area is also an economic engine for the community and hosts the annual Sea Otter Classic, a large bicycling event. Fort Ord has a rich history, including being traversed by Spanish settlers and serving as a military training ground for American soldiers. The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management will manage the National Monument, which will become part of the Bureau's National Landscape Conservation System. The Department of the Interior lands in California alone contribute $980 million to local economies and support 7,600 recreation-related jobs.
