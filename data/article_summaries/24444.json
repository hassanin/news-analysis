Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano discussed their efforts to cut costs and make government more efficient. They have implemented several measures at their agencies to save money and better serve the American people. 

At the Department of Agriculture, Secretary Vilsack has asked each acting member of his sub-cabinet and staff person to seek out and report on savings each week. Some examples of financial savings include redirecting staff assignments to save on unnecessary travel, combining costly training conferences, partnering with US Bank to modernize payment processes, utilizing web-based training instead of in-person training, and canceling or reducing the scope of agreements for services that are no longer required. These measures have resulted in significant cost savings for the department.

At the Department of Homeland Security, Secretary Napolitano ordered an Efficiency Review to promote efficiency, reduce duplication, and improve customer service. Some examples of efficiency improvements include implementing a radio frequency identification system at a port of entry to expedite the crossing of pre-screened individuals, standardizing building designs for ports of entry to save costs and improve operations, and digitizing ink samples to improve investigation of criminal and terrorist activities. The department is also working on reducing reliance on contractors, improving the procurement process, addressing operational problems before implementing systems, and conducting independent cost estimations for major acquisitions.

Overall, both departments are focused on making government more efficient and effective while being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.
