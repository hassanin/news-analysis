The White House announced the launch of the Open Government Website and Initiative in May 2009. The initiative aims to engage the public in the policymaking process and create a more open and accessible federal decision-making process. The Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President, Valerie Jarrett, described it as an unprecedented process for public engagement in policymaking. The President believes that effective policy benefits from the best available information in society and that involving a diverse segment of Americans will strengthen government policies. The initiative is based on the principles of transparency, participation, and collaboration. The Chief Technology Officer, in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Service Administration (GSA), was tasked with developing recommendations for an OMB Directive on Open Government. The public engagement process consists of three phases: brainstorming, discussion, and drafting, which will inform the development of recommendations on open government. The goal is to experiment with mechanisms for effective citizen participation and complement the expertise of government employees with the knowledge and expertise of the American people. In addition to the public engagement process, the White House is committed to practical projects that embed the values and practices of open government. Examples include the launch of "data.gov" and "Regulations.gov Exchange" to improve access to government information and citizen participation in federal agency rulemaking. The President has encouraged each Cabinet department to adopt more open government innovations.
