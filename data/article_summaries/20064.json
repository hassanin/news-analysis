The White House has released a fact sheet outlining new executive actions to improve the arrivals experience for international travelers to the United States. The goal is to attract and welcome 100 million international visitors annually by the end of 2021. The Department of Commerce and Department of Homeland Security have jointly released a report that includes airport-specific action plans for 17 of the highest-traffic airports in the country, which account for 73.7% of all international travelers to the US. The plans include measures such as installing automated passport control kiosks and implementing mobile passport control technology. The aim is to provide a best-in-class arrivals experience while maintaining safety and security. The report also highlights the progress made in supporting travel and tourism to the US, such as reducing waiting periods for visas and increasing the length of business and tourist visas issued to Chinese citizens.
