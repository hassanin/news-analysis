The White House has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in 1995, regarding foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process, is to continue beyond January 23, 2010. The crisis caused by these terrorists has not been resolved and they continue to engage in activities that threaten the peace process and are hostile to US interests in the region. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to maintain economic sanctions against these terrorists to respond to the threat they pose.
