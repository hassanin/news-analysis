Aetna, one of the largest health insurers in the US, has announced that it will withdraw its individual market plans in Nebraska and Delaware. This means that the company will not participate in any exchanges in 2018. Aetna has already withdrawn from Iowa and Virginia, leaving only four states in its original Obamacare expansion. Despite performing well in other areas, Aetna expects to lose around $200 million on Obamacare this year, on top of previous losses totaling nearly $700 million. Humana has also left the exchanges completely, while Anthem is showing signs of unease. The problem lies in the restrictive regulations of Obamacare, preventing insurers from selling profitable products that can attract enough customers. The GOPâ€™s American Health Care Act includes tools that can help mitigate some of the damage caused by Obamacare and create a more stable insurance market. However, the failure to pass the reform this spring has contributed to business uncertainty. Time is running out to provide stability to the healthcare market.
