President Obama signed the America Invents Act, a patent reform legislation aimed at helping American entrepreneurs and businesses bring their inventions to market sooner, creating new businesses and new jobs. The act includes provisions such as a fast track option for patent processing within 12 months, reducing the current patent backlog, reducing litigation regarding patent validity, increasing patent quality, and increasing the ability of American inventors to protect their intellectual property abroad. Additionally, the President announced new initiatives to help convert ideas from universities and research labs into new products, including the launch of a new National Institutes of Health (NIH) center to assist biotech entrepreneurs, the development of a National Bioeconomy Blueprint, university presidents committing to a commercialization initiative, the launch of a university commercialization prize, the development of university endowments focused on lab-to-market innovations, and new tools and license agreements for start-ups and small businesses.
