In a phone call with Speaker John Boehner, President Obama reiterated his willingness to negotiate with Republicans on policies that they believe would benefit the country, but only after the threat of government shutdown and default is removed. The President emphasized his priorities, including expanding economic opportunity, supporting job creation, enhancing American businesses' competitiveness, strengthening the Affordable Care Act, and reducing the nation's deficit. He urged Speaker Boehner to hold a vote in the House of Representatives on the Senate-passed measure to reopen the government immediately. The President also pressed the Speaker to allow a timely up-or-down vote in the House to raise the debt limit without any ideological conditions, stating that failure to do so would have serious consequences for middle-class families and the American economy.
