The White House is disappointed that Senate Republicans have voted to protect a loophole that allows millionaires to avoid paying taxes, at the expense of students. If Congress does not act, over 7.4 million students will see their interest rates double on July 1. The White House is urging Republicans to propose a solution that keeps rates low for students without burdening middle-class families or undermining women's healthcare. They are committed to working with Congress to prevent rates from doubling and ensure that students have access to affordable education.
