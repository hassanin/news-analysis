On July 24, 2011, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations. This was done to address the threat posed by these organizations to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. These criminal organizations have grown in scope and gravity, posing a danger to international political and economic systems. They are increasingly involved in foreign governments and the international financial system, which weakens democratic institutions, undermines the rule of law, and disrupts economic markets. These organizations also contribute to violent conflicts and aid other dangerous individuals. On March 15, 2019, additional steps were taken to address this national emergency due to the evolving nature of these organizations and the direct threat they pose to the safety and welfare of the United States. Given their ability to generate revenue through illegal activities, including violence and abuse, it is necessary to continue the national emergency beyond July 24, 2020. President Trump has therefore extended the national emergency for another year in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
