The White House is calling on Iran to provide assistance in the case of retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, who disappeared in Iran nine years ago. The United States is committed to finding Levinson and bringing him home, and this remains a top priority. The statement expresses sympathy for the Levinson family, who have endured the pain of his disappearance for too long.
