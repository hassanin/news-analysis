The press briefing discussed the impacts of the government shutdown and the White House's position. The White House is ready to sign the bill passed by the House to reopen the government, but will not negotiate on the status of unlawful immigrants while the government is shut down. The briefing also addressed the different ways this shutdown is different from the one in 2013, including the use of unobligated funds to keep agencies open. The briefing ended with questions about the public perception of the shutdown, the meeting between President Trump and Senator Schumer, and the length of the shutdown.
