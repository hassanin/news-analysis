On December 7, 2012, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 915, establishes the Department of Homeland Security's Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) in statute. BEST is comprised of multi-agency units that aim to address and reduce security threats and violence on the nation's southern and northern borders and at selected seaports. 

The second bill, H.R. 6063, is known as the "Child Protection Act of 2012." It makes changes to the Criminal Code related to child pornography and the protection of child witnesses. It also addresses Department of Justice programs focused on preventing and interdicting child exploitation and child pornography on the internet. 

The third bill, H.R. 6634, delays the requirement in the STOCK Act that financial disclosure forms of certain employees of the Executive and Legislative Branches be made available on official websites. This delay extends the deadline for making these forms available until April 15, 2013.
