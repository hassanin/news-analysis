On January 24, 2020, the President signed two bills into law. The first is H.R. 583, also known as the "PIRATE Act." This act increases penalties for pirate radio broadcasters and mandates the Federal Communications Commission to step up enforcement efforts. The second bill is H.R. 2476, the "Securing American Nonprofit Organizations Against Terrorism Act of 2019." This act establishes a Nonprofit Security Grant Program within the Department of Homeland Security, which provides grants to eligible nonprofit organizations for security enhancements to protect against terrorist attacks.
