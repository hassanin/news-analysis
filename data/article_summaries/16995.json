The article is about Executive Order 13577, which establishes the SelectUSA Initiative. The purpose of this initiative is to attract and retain business investment in the United States in order to create jobs, spur economic growth, and promote American competitiveness. The SelectUSA Initiative will be housed in the Department of Commerce and will coordinate outreach and engagement by the federal government to promote the United States as the premier location to operate a business. It will also serve as an ombudsman to resolve issues involving federal programs or activities related to pending investments. The initiative will provide information to domestic and foreign firms on the investment climate in the United States, federal programs and incentives available to investors, and state and local economic development organizations. The Department of Commerce will provide funding and administrative support for the initiative, and a Federal Interagency Investment Working Group will be established to coordinate activities and respond to specific issues that affect business investment decisions. The order is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
