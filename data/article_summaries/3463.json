The Biden-Harris Administration has released the 2023 Women, Peace, and Security Strategy (WPS) and National Action Plan, reaffirming the commitment to promoting women's participation, leadership, and engagement in decision-making processes. The strategy focuses on five core lines of effort: participation, protection, relief, response, and recovery, integration and institutionalization, and partnerships. It aims to integrate WPS principles across U.S. policies and programs and strengthen partnerships to advance the WPS agenda. The administration has also taken various actions to advance women's meaningful participation, protect their human rights, prioritize them in relief efforts, integrate WPS principles, and promote partnerships. The WPS agenda is a cornerstone of the Biden-Harris Administration's work to prevent conflict and promote the safety and security of women and girls.
