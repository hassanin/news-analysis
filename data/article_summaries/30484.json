If confirmed, Benton will bring extensive experience, having served as a Senator in the Washington State legislature for 20 years, as well as holding positions in the Santa Clarita Community College District Board of Trustees and the Washington State House of Representatives. Benton has also been an entrepreneur, starting his first company at the age of 17 and subsequently building and selling several others. Additionally, he has served as the Director of the Clark County Environmental Services Department, where he successfully reduced the cost of removing hazardous waste, increased citizen participation, and tripled the tonnage of hazardous waste removed.
