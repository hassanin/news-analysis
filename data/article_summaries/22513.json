The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a background briefing to discuss the First Step Agreement on Iran's Nuclear Program. The agreement is a first step towards a comprehensive agreement and aims to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. The agreement includes several key elements such as halting enrichment above 5 percent, neutralizing the stockpile of near 20 percent uranium, and limiting centrifuge production and installation. Iran has also committed to halt progress on its 3.5 percent stockpile and its plutonium track. The agreement also includes extensive monitoring and verification measures by the IAEA. In terms of sanctions relief, the limited relief is worth at most $6-7 billion and includes measures such as pausing efforts to further reduce Iran's crude oil sales, suspending U.S. sanctions on Iran's petrochemical exports, and allowing the transfer of $4.2 billion in revenue from oil sales to Iran. The relief is temporary, targeted, and reversible. The briefing also addressed concerns about the impact of the agreement on the sanctions regime, the right to enrich uranium, and the involvement of Israel. The officials emphasized that the agreement does not recognize a right to enrich for Iran and that the relief is limited and reversible. They also mentioned that the President will speak with Prime Minister Netanyahu and that the U.S. will continue to work with Congress on the issue. The briefing concluded with a note of appreciation for the negotiators' efforts.
