Forty years ago, the first cases of AIDS were reported in Los Angeles, marking the beginning of a devastating epidemic. Since then, over 700,000 Americans and 32.7 million people worldwide have died from AIDS-related illnesses, disproportionately affecting LGBTQ+ communities, communities of color, and marginalized populations. On the 40th anniversary of HIV/AIDS, we remember those lost and celebrate the resilience of the 38 million people living with HIV globally. Progress has been made in research, prevention, treatment, and care, thanks to activists, researchers, and medical professionals. The US has become a leader in the fight against HIV through initiatives like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and contributions to the Global Fund. Efforts are estimated to have saved over 20 million lives. To further combat the epidemic, the President has requested $670 million from Congress to increase access to treatment, expand preventive measures, and ensure equitable access to services without stigma or discrimination. Despite progress, there is still work to be done, including empowering researchers, healthcare providers, and addressing the stigma faced by those living with HIV.
