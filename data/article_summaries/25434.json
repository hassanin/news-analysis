In this article, President Donald Trump issues a proclamation declaring November as National Family Caregivers Month. He acknowledges the selflessness and dedication of family caregivers who provide support and care to disabled, elderly, chronically ill, or injured family members. These caregivers enable their loved ones to maintain independence and a sense of security. The proclamation highlights the various services and sacrifices that family caregivers make, including meal preparation, finance management, transportation, and companionship. The Administration for Community Living and the Department of Veterans Affairs provide support programs and resources for caregivers. The proclamation encourages all Americans to express gratitude and acknowledge the important work of family caregivers.
