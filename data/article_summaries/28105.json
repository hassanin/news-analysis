In this article, President Trump addresses the issue of MS-13, a dangerous gang that operates in the United States. He criticizes the loopholes in the country's laws that allow criminals and gang members to enter and stay in the country. He specifically mentions the release of unaccompanied alien minors into American communities, which is easily exploited by MS-13. The President calls on Congress to close these loopholes and prioritize securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery. He argues that these measures are necessary to create a safe and lawful immigration system.
