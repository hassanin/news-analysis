Russia's actions in cutting off electricity and natural gas to Finland, halting natural gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria, and threatening other European nations have demonstrated its unreliability as an energy supplier to Europe. The United States and the European Commission condemn Russia's use of energy blackmail and are committed to strengthening Europe's energy security. Efforts are underway across Europe to diversify supplies and reduce dependence on Russian gas. Projects such as the Balticonnector, which connects Finland to Estonia, and the Poland-Lithuania Gas Interconnector aim to increase security of supply and reinforce optionality and resilience in the Baltic gas market. The European Commission and the United States are partnering to address these challenges through their joint Task Force on Energy Security. They aim to diversify Europe's supply of natural gas, accelerate the deployment of energy efficiency and smart technologies, electrify heating, and increase clean energy output to reduce demand for fossil fuels. As part of these efforts, Finland has signed a contract to lease a floating LNG import terminal from a U.S. provider, which will be operational by the end of this year.
