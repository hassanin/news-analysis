The Presidential Memoranda issued on July 17, 2020, discusses the continuation of U.S. drug interdiction assistance to the government of Colombia. The memorandum certifies that the interdiction of aircraft suspected of engaging in illicit drug trafficking in Colombia's airspace is necessary due to the significant threat it poses to the country's national security. It also acknowledges that Colombia has appropriate procedures in place to prevent innocent loss of life during such interdictions, including the ability to identify and warn aircraft before using force. The Secretary of State is tasked with publishing this determination in the Federal Register and notifying Congress.
