President Barack Obama has proclaimed February 2016 as American Heart Month, urging all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 5th. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and it affects people of all races and ethnicities. The President emphasizes the importance of addressing heart disease urgently and encourages individuals to take steps to reduce risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. Regular check-ups and preventive measures, such as testing cholesterol levels and checking blood pressure, are crucial for early detection of heart disease. The Affordable Care Act provides access to recommended preventive services for free. First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative aims to reduce obesity, a contributing factor to heart disease, among children. The President also mentions the Million Hearts initiative, launched five years ago, which aims to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. The government will continue to invest in research for targeted medical treatments and personalized health information. The President calls for renewed efforts to raise awareness of heart disease and its consequences, and to work towards a healthier future for all.
