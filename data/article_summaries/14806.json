The White House Office of the Press Secretary commended Republicans and Democrats in the United States Senate for taking an important step towards ensuring that the United States can negotiate and enforce strong trade agreements. The President wants to provide job training and community college education to an estimated 100,000 workers per year and urges Congress to send trade adjustment assistance to his desk so he can sign it. The President also wants to reaffirm and bolster trade relations between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa by passing the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The President asks Congress to complete action on trade enforcement legislation that has passed both the House and the Senate. The vote and further action on trade in Congress this week will send an important message to the world about Americaâ€™s engagement and continued global leadership.
