President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 14-20, 2015, as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week. The proclamation recognizes the important role that Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) play in providing education opportunities for Hispanic students and addressing the disparity in college graduation rates among Hispanics. HSIs serve over half of the undergraduate Hispanic population in the United States and work to provide access to higher education for low- and middle-income students. The proclamation also highlights the projected growth of the Hispanic population in the country and the need to ensure they have access to quality education. The Obama Administration has pledged $1 billion in funding to support HSIs and has also announced plans to make community college free for responsible students. The proclamation calls on public officials, educators, and the people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate programs and activities that recognize the contributions of HSIs and their graduates to the country.
