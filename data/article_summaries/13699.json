In this article, President Barack Obama announces the rescinding of the Mexico City Policy, which was a policy that restricted funding to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that provided advice, counseling, or information regarding abortion. Obama argues that the policy was unnecessarily broad and undermined efforts to promote safe and effective voluntary family planning in developing countries. He expresses his desire to end the politicization of international family planning assistance and initiate a fresh conversation on the topic. Obama also mentions his intention to work with Congress to restore U.S. financial support for the U.N. Population Fund. The article includes a memorandum in which Obama revokes previous presidential memoranda related to the Mexico City Policy and directs the Secretary of State and the Administrator of USAID to waive conditions on current grants and cease imposing these conditions on future grants.
