In this article, President Obama calls on Congress to ratify the new START treaty for the security of the United States. He emphasizes that the ratification of the treaty is not about political popularity but about the safety of the country. The treaty has the support of past presidents, Republican secretaries of state, NATO allies, and military leaders. President Obama also discusses the recently approved economic measures that will help the economy grow and create jobs. He urges Congress to prioritize the ratification of the START treaty, which will reduce the global nuclear arsenal and make the US safer. Without a new treaty, the US will not be able to verify Russia's nuclear arsenal, which would undermine Reagan's principle of "trust but verify." The President emphasizes that ratifying the treaty is not a victory for a particular party but a means to ensure the security of the United States. He concludes by urging Congress to act swiftly and demonstrate the same unity they showed in addressing economic issues.
