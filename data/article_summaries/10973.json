The White House and the Department of Education have announced that the public will have the opportunity to vote for the top three finalists of the Race to the Top High School Commencement Challenge. Starting on April 26, the public can review and rate a three-minute video and short essay from each of the six high school finalists. President Obama will then select the national winner from the three high schools with the highest average ratings. The winner will be announced on May 4 and the President will visit the winning high school to deliver the commencement address. The challenge aims to recognize high schools that provide students with the skills and education they need to succeed in college and their careers.
