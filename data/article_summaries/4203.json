The White House has released its annual report to Congress on the staff employed in the White House Office. Since 1995, it has been a requirement for the White House to provide this report, which includes the titles and salaries of all staff members. In line with President Biden's promise of transparency, the report is being publicly disclosed on the White House website as it is submitted to Congress.
