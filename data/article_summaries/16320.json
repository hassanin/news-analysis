The United States House of Representatives has voted to authorize the Title X Train and Equip Program for the Moderate Syrian Opposition, which is an important step in confronting the threat posed by the terrorist group ISIL. This program will allow the US to train and equip vetted elements of the moderate Syrian opposition to defend themselves against ISIL forces in Syria. The training will be conducted outside of Syria, in partnership with regional countries, and there will be no US military personnel in Syria as part of this program. The goal is to create the conditions for a political solution to Syria's crisis. The President urges the Senate to pass this bill without delay.
