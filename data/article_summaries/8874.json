The Biden-Harris Administration, along with Australia, Denmark, and Norway, has launched the Export Controls and Human Rights Initiative to combat the misuse of technology by authoritarian governments and promote democratic values. This initiative aims to address the misuse of cyber intrusion, surveillance, and dual-use technologies to suppress dissent, harass human rights defenders, target minority communities, and interfere with privacy. The United States is also collaborating with allies to reinforce democratic values in emerging technology areas. These efforts are a continuation of previous actions taken by the United States to prevent the abuse of technology for human rights violations.
