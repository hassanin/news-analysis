First Lady Melania Trump embarked on a week-long trip to Africa as part of her Be Best initiative. She visited four countries - Ghana, Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt - in just five days. During her visits, she focused on promoting children's well-being and education, while also learning about the unique culture and traditions of each country. In Ghana, she toured hospitals and donated baby items. In Malawi, she emphasized the importance of education and donated school supplies. In Kenya, she visited a children's home and a burn site important for conservation. Finally, in Egypt, she met with the President and First Lady, and visited cultural sites.
