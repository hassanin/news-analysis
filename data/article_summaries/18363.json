The article discusses two key steps taken by the Obama Administration to implement the Export Control Reform Initiative. The first step is an executive order signed by President Obama to update delegated presidential authorities over the administration of certain export and import controls under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976. The second step is the notification of Congress regarding changes to the U.S. Munitions List, which is part of the reform initiative. The article explains that the reform initiative aims to overhaul the nation's export control system in a common sense approach. The changes include consolidating brokering responsibilities with the Department of State, eliminating possible "double licensing" requirements, establishing a congressional notification process, and making other administrative updates. The rebuilding of the U.S. Munitions List is also highlighted, with the goal of providing more flexibility and efficiency in equipping and maintaining partner capabilities while preventing potential adversaries from acquiring military items. The changes to the U.S. Munitions List will be implemented in stages throughout 2013.
