President Donald J. Trump has declassified a memorandum from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which raises concerns about the integrity of decisions made by the Department of Justice and the FBI to use surveillance tools against American citizens. The President's national security team, including law enforcement officials and intelligence community members, were involved in this decision. The President is grateful for the hardworking public servants who protect America and uphold its laws while safeguarding the constitutional rights of its citizens. Minority members of the Committee are said to have drafted a separate memorandum. The Administration is willing to work with Congress to accommodate oversight requests while ensuring the protection of intelligence sources and methods.
