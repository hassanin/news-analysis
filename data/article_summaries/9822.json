President Obama signed an Executive Order imposing sanctions against Syrian officials and others involved in human rights abuses in Syria. The Order allows the United States to target individuals and entities engaged in repression, senior officials of blocked entities, and those who have provided support to or are owned or controlled by blocked persons. The United States strongly condemns the Syrian government's use of violence and intimidation against its people and calls for an end to further acts of violence and human rights abuses. The Order imposes sanctions on specific individuals and entities, including Mahir al-Asad, Atif Najib, Ali Mamluk, the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate, and the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - Qods Force, for their roles in the Syrian regime's actions in Dar'a and their support to the Syrian government. As a result, any property in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons that is linked to these individuals and entities is blocked, and transactions with them are generally prohibited for U.S. persons.
