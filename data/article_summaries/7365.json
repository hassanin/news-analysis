The article discusses two pieces of economic news that highlight the ongoing progress of the recovery in the United States. The first piece of news is that last year, there were 21 million unemployment insurance claims before Thanksgiving, whereas this year, there were only 2.4 million claims. This indicates a significant improvement in job creation and a decrease in unemployment. The second piece of news is that the U.S. economy has experienced faster growth in the first three quarters of this year than in any year in the past four decades.

The article also mentions that there is still work to be done, particularly in addressing price increases that impact Americans' finances and wage gains. The Biden administration is taking steps to reduce the cost of gas, implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and pass the Build Back Better Act, which aims to cut costs for American families and provide tax relief. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of continuing to build on the progress made in the economy.
