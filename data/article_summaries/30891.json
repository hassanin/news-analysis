On November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall was torn down by courageous men and women from both East and West Germany, marking the end of a symbol of oppression and failed socialism. The dilapidated state of East Germany contradicted the propaganda of a thriving workers' paradise. The citizens of East Germany yearned for more opportunities, decent wages, and the freedom to worship according to their beliefs. United in a common cause, they risked their lives for freedom and played a significant role in lifting the Iron Curtain that had separated Europe. While the Cold War has ended, tyrannical regimes continue to employ oppressive tactics. The United States and its allies remain committed to advancing the principles of individual liberty and freedom. The fall of the Berlin Wall serves as a lesson to oppressive regimes that the iron will of a determined people cannot be contained by any Iron Curtain. On the 30th anniversary of the wall's fall, the United States congratulates Germany on its progress in reunification and pledges to continue working with them to ensure freedom remains a beacon of hope for the world.
