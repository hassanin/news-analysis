President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. has declared a major disaster for the Bear River Band of the Rohnerville Rancheria, following an earthquake that occurred between December 20, 2022, and January 1, 2023. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement the tribe's efforts in the affected areas. The Bear River Band and certain nonprofit organizations can receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Additionally, federal funding is available for hazard mitigation measures. Benigno Bern Ruiz has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
