The article states that President Donald Trump has done nothing wrong and that the Democrats are conducting a partisan impeachment inquiry for political reasons. The Democrats are accused of violating the Constitution and denying the President basic rights, such as calling witnesses and cross-examining them. The letter sent by Counsel to the President, Pat Cipollone, argues that the Democrats' inquiry lacks constitutional foundation, fairness, and due process protections. It is suggested that the Democrats are pursuing partisan goals and influencing the upcoming 2020 election. The Executive Branch, therefore, refuses to participate in this "partisan political theater." The article concludes by stating that President Trump and his Administration will continue to fight for the American people, the economy, prosperity, and America's interests.
