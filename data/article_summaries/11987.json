On August 3, 2012, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 2527, is called the "National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act." This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to create and distribute coins to honor the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The second bill, S. 1335, is known as the "Pilot's Bill of Rights." This bill allows individuals who are being investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding pilot certification to access data from the FAA that would help them participate in the investigation. It also gives individuals affected by a decision from the National Transportation Safety Board upholding an FAA decision the ability to appeal in a Federal court.
