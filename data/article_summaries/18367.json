President Barack Obama has announced new lending initiatives to support small businesses in the United States. Small businesses have been heavily impacted by the financial crisis, facing reduced lending by banks, decreased real estate values, and weakened sales. The Obama Administration is committed to helping small businesses access capital and create jobs for a strong economic recovery. The administration has already taken steps to encourage job growth and increase credit flow to small businesses, with SBA loan volume up over 70% compared to the depths of the recession. However, more needs to be done. The President's new measures include supporting lending by small banks and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) through the Financial Stability Plan, seeking legislation to increase the maximum loan size for Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, and convening a conference to explore further steps to help small businesses access credit. The aim is to help small businesses recover, as they are the engines of job growth and lead the way to the industries of the future.
