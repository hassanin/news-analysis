Economic growth is seen as a key factor in lifting countries out of poverty, and the private sector is seen as crucial in stimulating sustainable economic growth. Efforts will be made to create the right environment for business, investment in education and innovation, and building capable institutions. The two countries also aim to tackle corruption and bribery that hinder the distribution of resources to those in need. Trade and regional integration, especially in Africa, will be promoted.

In fragile states, where development has been challenging, the focus will be on strengthening local economies, job creation, and involving women in decision-making processes. Efforts will also be made to promote openness, strengthen civilian policing, and improve disaster preparedness and response.

The article emphasizes the importance of aid effectiveness, accountability, transparency, and results. The quantity and quality of aid are seen as equally important, and mechanisms have been put in place to provide clear information about aid programs. The aim is to achieve better results and encourage other donors to follow suit. The two countries also aim to transform the way bilateral aid is delivered and strengthen multilateral organizations.

Global health is another area of focus, with a goal to increase vaccination rates and improve care for pregnant women and newborns.

Lastly, the article discusses the importance of addressing climate change. Urgent global action is needed to prevent the reversal of progress and increase the risk of insecurity. The two countries aim to hold the increase in temperature below two degrees Celsius and work towards implementing agreements reached in Cancun. They will invest in clean technologies, protect forests, and support the REDD+ partnership to benefit the world's poorest people who depend on forests for their livelihoods.
