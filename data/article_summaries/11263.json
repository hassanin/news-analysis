First Lady Michelle Obama has joined The Walt Disney Company to announce new standards for food advertising to kids. Disney will become the first major media company to introduce these standards, requiring all food and beverage products advertised on their programming targeting kids and families to meet Disney's nutrition guidelines by 2015. The guidelines promote fruit and vegetable consumption and call for limiting calories, saturated fat, sodium, and sugar. American children see an estimated $1.6 billion worth of food and beverage marketing each year, much of which is for unhealthy foods. The First Lady has been focusing on this issue since launching her Let's Move! initiative in 2010. Disney's new initiative is seen as a game changer for the health of children, and they are asking themselves if the ads they show and the food they sell are good for kids. Disney will also introduce the "Mickey Check" tool, which calls out nutritious food and menu items sold in stores, online, and at their parks and resorts. They will also continue to promote healthy eating through their Disney Magic of Healthy Living initiative, which includes online resources, live events, and informative programming. Disney has already made efforts to provide well-balanced kids' meals at their parks and resorts and has sold over two billion servings of Disney licensed fruits and vegetables in North America. They will continue to reduce sodium, sugar, and promote healthier options in their food offerings.
