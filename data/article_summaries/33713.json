In this article, Ivanka Trump, Advisor to the President, discusses the current state of the US economy and job market. She highlights the positive impact of tax cuts and deregulation on job creation, with 5.4 million jobs created since President Trump's inauguration. The unemployment rate has dropped to 3.6%, the lowest since 1969, and there has been a high number of people entering the labor force. However, there are 7.4 million open jobs and a need to empower the workforce with in-demand skills. Ivanka Trump promotes the apprenticeship model as an effective way to provide skills education without student loans. Since 2017, over 500,000 people have entered apprenticeship programs, with an average starting salary of over $70,000. The Trump administration is proposing a new apprenticeship model called the Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship, which would allow industries to offer skills education through associations, consortia, nonprofits, and other mechanisms.
