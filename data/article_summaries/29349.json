President Trump's infrastructure plan aims to use $200 billion in federal investment to leverage $1.5 trillion in total infrastructure spending. The plan involves a federal incentive program where states, localities, and private entities can approach the government with infrastructure projects that have an outside revenue stream to fund and maintain them. The federal government would then provide grants to cover the difference, with a limit of 20% of new revenue for each project and a cap of 10% for each state. The plan also includes widening access to capital through federal lending programs. The Trump Administration believes that states and localities are better equipped to understand their infrastructure needs and the federal government will provide support and incentives to make these projects a reality.
