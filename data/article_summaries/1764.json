The President believes that U.S. Steel played a crucial role in World War II and continues to be important for national security. While the President welcomes foreign manufacturers investing in America, he thinks the purchase of an American-owned company by a foreign entity, even from a close ally, should be scrutinized for its potential impact on national security and supply chain reliability. The administration is prepared to investigate such transactions and take appropriate action based on the findings. The President sees steel as essential for American manufacturing, including infrastructure, cars, and clean energy. Under President Biden, 800,000 manufacturing jobs have been created, and policies like the Bipartisan Infrastructure law, Inflation Reduction Act, and Chips and Science Act are driving a resurgence of American manufacturing. The President has also taken steps to protect U.S. steel companies from unfair trade practices. The United Steelworkers union has been instrumental in these efforts, and the President recognizes the importance of union workers in building the economy and ensuring a strong domestic steel industry for both the economy and national security.
