The National Space Council, revived by President Trump, will hold its first meeting in nearly 25 years. Vice President Mike Pence, as the chairman of the council, will deliver a message that America will lead in space again. The intelligence community has reported that Russia and China are developing antisatellite technology that could threaten the effectiveness of the US military. The focus of America's space program will be shifted towards human exploration and discovery, including establishing a renewed American presence on the moon and eventually bringing mankind to Mars. The administration also aims to create the necessary space technology to protect national security and to promote reforms that expand opportunities for American citizens and maintain economic development in outer space. A Users' Advisory Group, including leaders from the commercial space industry, will be assembled in the coming weeks.
