President Obama has announced a new Veterans Job Corps initiative to help veterans find civilian employment. The initiative includes incentives to hire veterans as first responders, such as police officers and firefighters, and to protect and restore America's land and resources. The President also plans to support veteran entrepreneurship by expanding entrepreneurship training opportunities and providing tax credits for hiring veterans. Since taking office, President Obama has already taken steps to support veterans in finding work, including creating tax credits for hiring veterans and challenging the private sector to hire or train 100,000 veterans and their spouses by 2013. The administration has also increased access to reemployment services and developed online tools to boost veteran employment. Additionally, the President has encouraged the hiring of veterans in healthcare-related fields.
