President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring April 2016 as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. In the proclamation, Obama emphasizes the importance of standing up against sexual assault and changing the culture that questions victims rather than their attackers. He highlights the need to support victims and survivors, bring perpetrators to justice, and hold institutions accountable. Obama also mentions Vice President Joe Biden's work in fighting against sexual assault, including the "It's On Us" campaign and the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. The administration is taking action to eliminate sexual assault, including grants for the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative to end the backlog of untested rape kits and offering guidance to law enforcement on preventing gender bias in response to sexual assault. Obama urges all Americans to support survivors and work together to prevent sexual assault.
