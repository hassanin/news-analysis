President Obama is calling on all Americans to get tested for HIV and know their status in order to reduce the risk of infection. He emphasizes that one in five Americans with HIV do not know they have it, and most infections are spread by those who are unaware of their status. Knowing one's status allows individuals to take better care of themselves and reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. The President highlights the importance of a comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy, which focuses on reducing new infections, increasing access to care, and reducing health disparities. He also stresses that addressing this issue requires the commitment of various sectors, including businesses, faith groups, philanthropic organizations, the medical community, and educational institutions. Ultimately, he urges everyone to take responsibility in reducing their risk, supporting those affected by HIV/AIDS, and fighting stigma and discrimination.
