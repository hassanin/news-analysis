In this statement, the President expresses his disappointment with the impending enactment of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda. He believes that all people should be treated equally, regardless of their sexual orientation, and that this bill will not only be harmful to the gay community in Uganda, but also reflect poorly on the country's commitment to human rights. The President also mentions that this legislation will complicate the relationship between the United States and Uganda. He acknowledges the increase in violence and harassment against the LGBT community globally and commends those who continue to fight for human rights and dignity.
