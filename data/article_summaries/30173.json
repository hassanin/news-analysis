During National Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month, the U.S. government expresses its support for those affected by sickle cell disease (SCD) and its commitment to finding a cure for this genetic blood disorder. SCD affects over 100,000 Americans, causing pain, organ damage, and reduced life expectancy. Although it disproportionately affects African Americans, other racial and ethnic groups can also be affected. Currently, bone marrow and stem cell transplants are the only treatments with the potential to cure SCD, but finding a matching donor can be challenging. The U.S. government aims to support research for a cure that is accessible to all individuals, and plans to conduct clinical trials for new gene and cell-based therapies within the next 5 to 10 years as part of the National Institutes of Health's Cure Sickle Cell Initiative. Efforts are also being made to improve healthcare provider training and the quality of care for SCD patients from infancy to adulthood. With advances in genetic therapies and research, progress is being made towards finding a cure for all SCD patients.
