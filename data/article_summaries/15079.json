Coach John Gagliardi, the winningest coach in college football history, has announced his retirement. He had a career spanning 64 seasons, with 60 of them at Saint John's University. Gagliardi's unconventional coaching methods included instructing players to call him by his first name and not allowing tackling in practice. Despite these unusual techniques, he led St. John's to four national championships. Gagliardi's genuine concern for his players as scholar athletes and individuals will leave a lasting impact even as he steps away from the game.
