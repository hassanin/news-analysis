The article discusses the need to invest in restoring and preserving America's national parks. The heavy traffic and aging infrastructure are causing damage to the parks, leading to erosion of trails, diminished visitor amenities, and closed campgrounds. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, for example, has a $215 million deferred maintenance backlog. However, there is a proposal in Congress, backed by President Donald Trump, that aims to tackle the $11.6 billion backlog over the next 10 years. The bipartisan legislation would create the National Park Restoration Fund, which would receive revenue from energy development on federal lands to maintain the parks. The authors emphasize the importance of preserving these national treasures for future generations to enjoy.
