President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have announced the new SAVE Plan, which aims to provide relief to student loan borrowers. The plan offers a new repayment option that will save the average borrower around $1,000 per year. Eligible individuals can enroll at www.studentaid.gov/save to lower their monthly payments before payments resume in the fall. The SAVE Plan ensures that monthly payments are based on income rather than the total loan balance. Additionally, as long as borrowers make the required monthly payments, their loan balance will no longer grow due to unpaid interest, allowing them to make progress in paying down their debt. The Biden administration has already approved over $116 billion in debt cancellation for 3.4 million Americans, and they will continue to fight for accessible postsecondary education without the burden of unmanageable student loan debt.
