President Donald J. Trump has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance to American Samoa. This decision comes as a result of Tropical Storm Gita, which occurred from February 7 to 12, 2018. Previously, under the President's major disaster declaration on March 2, 2018, federal funding was made available for Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance at 75% of total eligible costs. With the President's order today, the federal share for these programs has been increased to 90% of total eligible costs.
