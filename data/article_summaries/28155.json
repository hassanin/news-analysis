President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster in the Commonwealth of Kentucky due to severe storms, straight-line winds, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred between February 6 and March 10, 2019. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available to the Commonwealth and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures for the entire Commonwealth will also receive federal funding. Allan Jarvis has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
