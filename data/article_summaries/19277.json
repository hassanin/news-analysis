President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Oklahoma and has ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The declaration was made in response to the severe winter storm that occurred on December 5-6, 2013. The federal funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Choctaw, Le Flore, McCurtain, and Pushmataha. Federal funding will also be available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Sandy Coachman has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
