Yesterday, several senior advisors to President Biden, including Tom Perez, Stefanie Feldman, Gene Sperling, Mitch Landrieu, and Dr. Paul Friedrichs, met with legislative leaders of the NewDEAL. The NewDEAL is a network of progressive state and local elected officials. The meeting involved discussions on how the Biden-Harris Administration is investing in communities through various acts and initiatives such as the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act. The group emphasized the importance of federal-state and local partnerships to utilize these investments and create opportunities for working families.
