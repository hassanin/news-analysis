President Obama has announced that federal agencies are expected to save $19 billion through improvements to their contracting and acquisition practices. This is part of the administration's efforts to cut waste and improve government performance. The President also announced that private sector leaders will be invited to a forum to discuss how technology can be better utilized to deliver more efficient services to taxpayers. The President met with the winner of the SAVE (Securing Americans Value and Efficiency) Award, Nancy Fichtner, who proposed that veterans leaving VA hospitals should be allowed to take their medication home instead of it being discarded. The VA has already begun implementing this idea. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will issue guidance to federal agencies on implementing government-wide reforms suggested by SAVE Award winners.
