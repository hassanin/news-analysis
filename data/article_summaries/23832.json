The article is a statement by Vice President Biden on the House passage of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The Vice President expresses his satisfaction with the progress made in reducing domestic violence since VAWA was first passed in 1994. He highlights the importance of the bill in holding abusers and rapists accountable and providing support for all victims of these crimes. The Vice President also emphasizes the urgent need for the bill, citing the alarming statistic that 40% of all mass shootings start with the perpetrator targeting their girlfriend, wife, or ex-wife. The new VAWA includes provisions to increase the use of proven models for reducing domestic violence homicides. The Vice President concludes by thanking the leaders from both parties and the bipartisan majorities in both the House and the Senate for their support.
