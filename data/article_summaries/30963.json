President Donald J. Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 with respect to Yemen is to continue beyond May 16, 2017. This decision is based on the ongoing threats to Yemen's peace, security, and stability, including the obstruction of the political process and the implementation of the 2011 agreement for a peaceful transition of power. The President believes it is necessary to maintain the national emergency in order to address these challenges.
