The Texas Department of Transportation has been awarded approximately $4 million in funding for the final design and construction of signal timing improvements at grade crossings between Fort Worth and the Texas/Oklahoma border. These improvements will increase the operating speed of Amtrak's Heartland Flyer and improve the train's on-time performance. The funding is part of the High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program.
