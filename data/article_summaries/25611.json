President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order titled "Modernizing Influenza Vaccines in the United States to Promote National Security and Public Health." The order aims to strengthen the country's public health and security by prioritizing efforts to modernize and improve the production and effectiveness of influenza vaccines. It also aims to promote increased influenza vaccine immunization across the entire population. The order acknowledges that seasonal influenza vaccines prevent millions of cases of disease and deaths in the U.S., but highlights the potential dangers of an influenza pandemic. The order seeks to promote new vaccine manufacturing technologies to enable faster and greater production of vaccine doses. This will allow experts to better match vaccines to actively circulating influenza viruses, making them more effective in treating seasonal influenza. The order also aims to develop vaccines that last longer and protect against a broader array of influenza viruses. Overall, the order reaffirms the Trump Administration's commitment to supporting American innovation and production while protecting the American people.
