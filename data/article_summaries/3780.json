President Biden expressed his disappointment in the outcome of not including the $15 minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan, as he had proposed. However, he respects the decision of the parliamentarian and the Senate's process. He plans to collaborate with congressional leaders to determine the next steps, emphasizing that no one should work full time and live in poverty. He urges Congress to swiftly pass the American Rescue Plan, which includes $1400 rescue checks for most Americans, funding to combat the virus, assistance in reopening schools, and support for those most affected by the crisis.
