President Obama has announced the formation of the White House Office of Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Sport. The purpose of this office is to promote the values of the Olympic Movement and encourage increased youth participation in athletics. The office will recommend federal policies and programs to enhance opportunities for youth participation in sports, particularly in urban areas. It will also coordinate with other government agencies and organizations to increase access and opportunities for youth to participate in sports. The goal is to give all children a chance to thrive and instill values, judgment, and teamwork through sports.
