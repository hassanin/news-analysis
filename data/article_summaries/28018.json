On February 25, 2011, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his government in Libya. The emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat posed to national security and foreign policy by Qadhafi's use of weapons, mercenaries, and violence against unarmed civilians. There was also concern that Libyan state assets would be misappropriated if not protected. The situation in Libya remains a threat to the United States, and measures are needed to prevent asset diversion and hinder the reconciliation process in Libya. As a result, President Trump has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This decision will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
