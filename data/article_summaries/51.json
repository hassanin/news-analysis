In a recent event at the South Court Auditorium, President Biden announced a major investment in domestic production of key minerals and materials. The aim is to create a fully domestic supply chain for critical materials like lithium, graphite, and rare earth materials, which are essential for various American products, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, and solar panels. Currently, the United States imports a significant portion of these minerals, primarily from China, Australia, and Chile. The President emphasized the need for a future that is "Made in America" and highlighted the importance of a reliable supply chain for critical minerals. The Department of Defense will invest $35 million in MP Materials, the only rare earth mining and processing operation in the country, to support the creation of a domestic supply chain for magnets used in electric vehicle motors and wind turbines. The investment is expected to create 350 jobs. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway Energy Renewables is starting a new facility to test the extraction of lithium from underground sources in California, and Redwood Materials announced a partnership with Ford and Volvo to recycle lithium-ion batteries. The President and other speakers at the event emphasized the need to prioritize American workers, labor unions, and environmental protections in the development of the clean energy supply chain. They also discussed the importance of community engagement, local hiring, and equitable benefits for the communities involved in these projects.
