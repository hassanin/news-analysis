On June 24, 2009, President Obama signed the "Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009" into law. The Act provides resources for the military, as well as supports diplomatic and development efforts worldwide. The President emphasized the urgent security situation abroad, with the Taliban resurging and al Qaeda increasing attacks from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The funding from the Act aims to defeat al Qaeda and eliminate their safe haven, while also promoting political and economic stability in post-conflict areas. It also supports diplomatic and development activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Act includes funding for domestic and international issues, such as enhancing the response to the H1N1 flu outbreak and providing resources to the International Monetary Fund to address the global financial crisis. The President expressed concerns about certain provisions of the bill that interfere with his constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations, but stated that he would not let these provisions limit his ability to engage in diplomacy or negotiations.
