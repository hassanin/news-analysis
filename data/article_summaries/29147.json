In this article, President Donald Trump issues a proclamation to re-impose a 10 percent tariff on imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada. The proclamation states that the previous measures agreed upon with Canada to address the national security threat posed by these imports have not been effective. The increase in imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada is seen as a threat to domestic aluminum production and capacity utilization. The tariff will be effective from August 16, 2020, and will apply to imports from all countries except Argentina, Australia, and Mexico. The Secretary of Commerce will revise the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States accordingly. Any previous exclusions granted by the Secretary of Commerce will remain valid, and expired exclusions may be renewed. Imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada admitted into foreign trade zones will also be subject to the tariff. Drawback will not be available for duties imposed under this proclamation.
