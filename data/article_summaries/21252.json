President Obama signed an Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against LGBT employees and prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity in federal employment. Currently, only 18 states and the District of Columbia have laws protecting LGBT workers from being fired based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, and there is no federal law protecting them. Studies have shown that supportive workplace policies improve job commitment, workplace relationships, job satisfaction, and health outcomes for LGBT employees. Many Fortune 500 companies already have nondiscrimination policies in place, as do 61% of federal contractors. The American public also supports LGBT workplace equality, with 63% favoring a federal law protecting LGBT people from employment discrimination. Various states, cities, and religious communities also support workplace protections for LGBT individuals. President Obama's Executive Order adds sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of protected categories under Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contractors from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Order does not allow for exemptions beyond those specified in a previous Executive Order, which permits religiously affiliated contractors to favor individuals of a particular religion when making employment decisions. The Order is administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Additionally, President Obama's Executive Order adds gender identity to the list of protected categories under Executive Order 11478, which bars discrimination against federal employees. The President believes it is important to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity in both Executive Action and legislation.
