The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for testing a long-range ballistic missile. The President and his national security team are in close consultations with allies and partners, following a trilateral meeting with Japan and South Korea. The Vice President is coordinating with allies at the APEC Conference. This launch violates UN Security Council resolutions and raises tensions in the region. The DPRK prioritizes its weapons programs over its people's well-being. All countries are urged to condemn these violations and call for negotiations. The United States will take necessary measures to ensure the security of its homeland and allies.
