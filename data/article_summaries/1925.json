President Biden is set to unveil his American Jobs Plan in Pittsburgh. The plan aims to create millions of good-paying jobs, rebuild infrastructure, and position the United States to outcompete China. It will be a once-in-a-century capital investment that will transform infrastructure, create jobs, and address the climate crisis. The plan has four parts: transportation infrastructure, housing and buildings, home and community-based care, and manufacturing and workforce development. To fund the plan, the President proposes to reform the corporate tax code, incentivizing job creation and investment in the US. The President is open to bipartisan support but is prepared to push the plan through Congress without Republican votes if necessary. The plan will be discussed in the first full Cabinet meeting tomorrow. The President is also watching the Derek Chauvin trial and has expressed his commitment to advancing racial justice. The administration is working to alleviate overcrowding in detention facilities at the border and continues to expel individuals and families. The President's policy review on North Korea is in its final stages, and the administration is consulting with Japan and South Korea on regional issues and foreign policy priorities. The President believes that the plan should be paid for, and he included corporate tax reform as a way to fund it.
