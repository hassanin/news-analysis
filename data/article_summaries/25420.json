The White House Press Briefing on March 11, 2019 discussed President Trump's 2020 budget proposal. The budget aims to continue the President's pro-job creation policies, keep taxes low, combat the opioid epidemic, protect veterans, defend the nation, and secure borders. The budget also addresses the issue of deficits, with a goal of reaching a balanced budget by 2034. The budget proposal includes nearly $2.7 trillion in savings and a 5 percent reduction to non-defense discretionary spending. It also includes funding for national defense, border security, school choice, infrastructure, and drug cost reduction. The budget proposal seeks to reform programs like Medicaid, TANF, SNAP, and certain housing programs by implementing uniform work requirements. The briefing also touched on other topics, such as the President's comments about Democrats and Jewish people, the national emergency declaration, and personnel changes in the administration.
