In this op-ed, Vice President of the United States, Michael R. Pence, argues that the media's panic over a "second wave" of coronavirus infections is overblown. He highlights that more than half of states are actually seeing cases decline or remain stable, and the positive test rates in every state, territory, and major metropolitan area, with the exception of three, are under 10%. Pence also points out that increased testing has allowed public health officials to identify and contain outbreaks in specific settings such as prisons, nursing homes, and meatpacking facilities. He emphasizes that less than 6% of Americans tested each week are found to have the virus, and the daily average case rate across the U.S. has dropped to 20,000. Pence credits the progress made in the fight against the virus to the leadership of President Trump and the whole-of-America approach taken, which includes expanding testing capacity, increasing the supply of crucial medical equipment, and working on therapeutics and a vaccine. He concludes by stating that the American people's embrace of social-distancing guidelines has been instrumental in slowing the spread of the virus and reopening the country in a safe and responsible manner. Pence criticizes the media for trying to scare the American people and asserts that the whole-of-America approach has been a success.
