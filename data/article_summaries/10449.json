The White House has announced that President Obama has signed into law the Airline Flight Crew Technical Corrections Act. This new law ensures that flight attendants and pilots are able to qualify for benefits under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), just like other American workers. The FMLA provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for events such as the birth or adoption of a child or to care for a family member with a serious health condition. The bipartisan legislation aims to help flight attendants and other flight crew members take care of their families when needed. The President sees this bill as an important step in the right direction to support workers and their families, although more work remains to be done.
