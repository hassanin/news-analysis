National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with Belarusian opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya to express the United States' support for the demands of the Belarusian people for democracy and human rights. Sullivan praised the bravery of Tsikhanouskaya and her husband, as well as other democracy activists and journalists who are currently imprisoned in Belarus. He strongly condemned the grounding of a Ryanair flight and the detention of journalist Raman Pratasevich, demanding their immediate release. Sullivan also emphasized the need for free and fair elections under OSCE observation to resolve the crisis in Belarus. The United States, along with the EU and other allies, will hold the Lukashenka regime accountable.
