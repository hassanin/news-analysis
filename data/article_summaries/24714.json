The White House has strongly condemned the reaffirmation of the death sentence for Iranian Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani by Iranian authorities. Pastor Nadarkhani's refusal to recant his Christian faith is the sole reason for his sentencing. The United States considers this action a shocking breach of Iran's international obligations, its own constitution, and stated religious values. The US stands in solidarity with Pastor Nadarkhani, his family, and all those who seek to practice their religion without fear of persecution. The trial and sentencing process for Pastor Nadarkhani highlights the Iranian government's disregard for religious freedom and violation of universal human rights. The US calls on Iranian authorities to immediately lift the sentence, release Pastor Nadarkhani, and demonstrate a commitment to basic human rights, including freedom of religion. The US also urges people of conscience and governments worldwide to demand Pastor Nadarkhani's immediate release.
