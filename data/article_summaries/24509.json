On World Press Freedom Day, the President of the United States acknowledges the importance of a free press in establishing sustainable democracies and prosperous societies. He pays tribute to journalists who have sacrificed their lives, freedom, or well-being in pursuit of truth and justice. However, he highlights that the right to seek, receive, and impart information is still under threat in many countries. While there have been some positive developments, such as the release of journalists in Burma, arbitrary arrests and detentions of journalists continue globally. The President condemns the detentions of journalists like Mazen Darwish in Syria and calls for their immediate release. He also mentions other cases like blogger Dieu Cay in Vietnam and journalist Dawit Isaak in Eritrea, who have been held without charge or trial for extended periods. The President emphasizes that threats, harassment, and indirect censorship continue to hinder freedom of expression and the press. He urges governments to protect the ability of journalists, bloggers, and dissidents to write and speak freely without retribution, and to refrain from using travel bans and other forms of censorship. The President also recognizes that not only governments but also criminal gangs, terrorists, and political factions can threaten press freedom. He states that when journalists are intimidated or attacked, societies suffer as fear replaces truth. The President calls for an end to the culture of impunity for such actions. He points out that the Middle East, North Africa, and other regions have experienced both the perils and the promise of a free press in fostering innovative, successful, and stable democracies. On World Press Freedom Day, the President calls on all governments to recognize the crucial role of a free press and take necessary measures to create societies where independent journalists can operate freely and without fear.
