Today, the FDA and CDC have authorized and recommended the first COVID-19 vaccines for kids under the age of five. This is a significant step forward in the fight against the virus, as virtually every American is now eligible for vaccination. The Biden administration has been preparing for this moment for months, securing doses and offering safe and effective mRNA vaccines for children as young as six months old. Parents will be able to start scheduling appointments at various locations, such as pediatricians' offices, children's hospitals, and pharmacies. The Vaccines.gov website will also be live next week, providing information on vaccine availability and appointments. These vaccines are considered safe and highly effective, providing parents with peace of mind knowing their child is protected from severe outcomes of COVID-19. Parents are encouraged to speak with their child's pediatrician and make a plan to get their child vaccinated as soon as possible.
