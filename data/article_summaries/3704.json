Vice President Harris is scheduled to visit El Paso, Texas on June 25th. She will be joined by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Earlier this year, President Biden assigned Vice President Harris to lead diplomatic efforts in addressing the underlying causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. As part of her ongoing work, the Vice President has already traveled to Guatemala and Mexico this month, and will now visit El Paso.
