President Trump is taking action to address the issue of high drug prices in the United States. He has highlighted the role of middlemen in the drug pricing process, who often receive kickbacks from drug manufacturers. These kickbacks may not be reflected in patients' out-of-pocket costs. The Trump administration has proposed a change to replace these kickbacks with transparent, up-front discounts directly given to patients. This move aims to increase fairness and transparency in healthcare. Additionally, eliminating these kickbacks can lead to lower drug prices and more competition in the market. The administration is also focused on improving transparency in other aspects of healthcare, such as requiring hospitals to post their standard charges online. Overall, President Trump is committed to delivering better care at more transparent and lower prices for American patients.
