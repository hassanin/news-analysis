The article discusses the passing of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act by Congress on a bipartisan basis. The act aims to lower costs for American retailers, farmers, and consumers by addressing the high prices and unfair practices of ocean carriers. During the pandemic, ocean carriers increased their prices by up to 1,000%, causing increased costs for American families. Additionally, these carriers often refuse to take American exports back to Asia, resulting in empty containers and financial losses for farmers, ranchers, and the economy. The bill is seen as a step towards reducing costs for families and ensuring fair treatment for American businesses.
