President Barack Obama has proclaimed October 7, 2016, as National Manufacturing Day in the United States. The proclamation recognizes the importance of innovation and the manufacturing industry in driving the American economy. Despite facing challenges in the past, the manufacturing industry has been on the rise in recent years, adding more than 800,000 jobs since 2010. To continue this progress, the government has implemented Manufacturing USA, a network of manufacturing hubs that bring together businesses, research universities, and governments to invest in the development of manufacturing technologies. The government is also encouraging the maker movement and supporting STEM education to foster a culture of making and entrepreneurship. National Manufacturing Day aims to inspire the next generation of workers and innovators to pursue careers in manufacturing and highlights the contributions of American manufacturers.
