The Trump Administration commends the passage of H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act, in the U.S. House of Representatives and urges the Senate to act swiftly on the legislation. President Trump had proposed $15 billion in rescissions of Federal funds in May, in an effort to restore fiscal responsibility. H.R. 3 aims to rescind funding that is not needed or has been unused within agencies for years, returning it to the American taxpayer. The Administration emphasizes its commitment to protecting taxpayers and believes that Senate passage of this legislation is crucial in reducing wasteful spending and improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of the Federal Government.
