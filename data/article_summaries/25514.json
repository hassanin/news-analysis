President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed October 6-12, 2019, as Fire Prevention Week in the United States. This week aims to promote emergency preparedness and reaffirm the commitment to fire safety. The proclamation honors the firefighters and first responders who have sacrificed their lives to protect citizens, homes, and communities. It also highlights the importance of preventing dangerous fires, as the number of fire-related deaths continues to rise despite a decrease in the number of fires. The proclamation emphasizes the need to conduct routine inspections of smoke alarms and practice home fire escapes. Additionally, measures to prevent wildfires, such as improving the health of forests and rangelands, are encouraged. President Trump signed legislation to support wildfire suppression operations and issued an Executive Order to promote active management of America's forests and Federal lands. The proclamation urges all Americans to take precautions to ensure fire safety and acknowledges the efforts of those who work to protect their communities.
