The White House issued a fact sheet on the Obama Administration's auto restructuring initiative for General Motors (GM) on May 31, 2009. The plan aimed to make GM viable by requiring the company to rework its business plan, accelerate its operational restructuring, and reduce its outstanding liabilities. GM developed a plan and secured commitments from major stakeholders to make sacrifices for the plan's success. As a result, the President approved the plan and allocated $30 billion of federal assistance to support GM's restructuring. GM planned to use Section 363 of the bankruptcy code to remove remaining obstacles to its relaunch. The restructuring involved significant operational changes, concessions from the United Auto Workers (UAW) on compensation and retiree healthcare, and agreements with bondholders. The plan also included painful but necessary restructuring steps, such as closing 11 facilities and idling three others. The newly organized GM would purchase assets from the old GM, and the U.S. government and the governments of Canada and Ontario would provide financing. The new GM would have less debt and a strong balance sheet. The government intended to manage its ownership stake in a hands-off, commercial manner, and only vote on core governance issues. GM would continue to honor consumer warranties, and the bankruptcy process would not significantly affect day-to-day operations.
