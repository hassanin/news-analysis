The Presidential Memoranda issued on September 6, 2019, focuses on the order of succession within the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). It states that in the event of the Chairman's death, resignation, or inability to perform their duties, the Chief of Staff, General Counsel, and Associate Directors of the CEQ will act as the Chairman in that order. However, individuals serving in an acting capacity cannot act as Chairman, and the President has the discretion to deviate from this order. The memorandum also revokes a previous Presidential Memorandum from January 13, 2017, regarding the order of succession within the CEQ. It concludes by stating that the memorandum does not affect the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
