This article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Donald Trump on March 22, 2018, regarding actions by the United States related to the Section 301 investigation of China's laws, policies, practices, or actions related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. The memorandum directs the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to take appropriate action to address China's unreasonable or discriminatory acts, policies, and practices that burden or restrict U.S. commerce. This may include increased tariffs on goods from China. The USTR is also instructed to pursue dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to address China's discriminatory licensing practices and to propose executive branch action to address concerns about Chinese investment in industries or technologies deemed important to the United States. The memorandum also authorizes and directs the Trade Representative to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
