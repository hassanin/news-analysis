The White House has issued a statement by National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice on the Executive Order on Advancing the Global Health Security Agenda. The statement emphasizes the importance of American leadership in advancing global health security and calls on all countries to do their part in preventing, detecting, and responding to infectious disease threats. The Global Health Security Agenda, launched in 2014, aims to empower the global community to work together to secure a world safe from epidemic threats. The Executive Order signed by President Obama further advances this agenda by establishing long-term policy objectives and a comprehensive framework for the United States to continue strengthening and institutionalizing achievements in global health security. The statement highlights the success of this initiative, including ending the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and leading the Zika response. The United States is partnering with 31 countries and the Caribbean Community to provide assistance in creating a step-by-step plan for preparedness. The Executive Order is seen as a crucial step towards a safer and more resilient future.
