The article discusses President Obama's new approach to development, which recognizes development as a moral, strategic, and economic imperative. The new U.S. development policy focuses on results-based, strategic investments in two signature initiatives: Feed the Future and the Global Health Initiative. The policy aims to foster emerging markets, invest in game-changing innovations, meet basic human needs in a sustainable fashion, tailor development strategies to unique conditions, and hold all aid recipients accountable. The U.S. will also be more selective in its development efforts, leverage other donors and the private sector, emphasize country ownership and mutual accountability, strengthen multilateral capabilities, and drive policy with analysis.
