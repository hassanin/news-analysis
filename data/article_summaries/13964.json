This article discusses the U.S. government's policy on hostage situations. The government acknowledges the increase in hostage takings by terrorist organizations and criminal groups and the challenges they pose in securing the safe recovery of U.S. nationals. The article emphasizes the need for improved communication and collaboration with families of hostages, shifting from a focus on social services to a new paradigm that prioritizes the safe recovery of loved ones. The government has implemented several organizational changes, including the creation of the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, Hostage Response Group, Intelligence Community Issue Manager for Hostage Affairs, and Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, to improve coordination and accountability. The policy reaffirms the commitment to make no concessions to hostage-takers, but emphasizes that "no concessions" does not mean "no communication." The government may communicate with hostage-takers, their intermediaries, interested governments, and local communities to secure the safe recovery of hostages. The article also addresses concerns about potential prosecutions of family members under the statute prohibiting the provision of material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations, stating that the government will explore all appropriate options to ensure the safe recovery of hostages and does not intend to suggest criminal prosecution to families. The government will assess the impact and effectiveness of these changes through status reports and comprehensive assessments.
