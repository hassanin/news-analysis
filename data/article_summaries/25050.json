This article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney and Assistant to the President and Chief Technology Officer Todd Park. They discuss President Obama's trip to Austin, Texas to kick off a series of middle-class jobs and opportunity tours. The President will announce two important executive actions to strengthen the economy, including launching competitions to create three new manufacturing innovation institutes and issuing an executive order requiring that newly released government data be made freely available in open machine-readable formats. Carney and Park also address questions about the U.S. presence in Afghanistan after the withdrawal, Russia potentially selling air defense systems to Syria, nominations being obstructed by Republicans, the debt ceiling, and the President's meetings with entrepreneurs and local residents.
