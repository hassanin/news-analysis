The Biden Administration is facilitating the air shipment of approximately 740,000 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Nestlé Health Science Alfamino® Infant and Alfamino® Junior formula from Switzerland to Plainfield, IN. This delivery, scheduled for September 16, will include about 63,000 pounds of Nestlé formula, primarily intended for hospitals and home health care providers for use under medical supervision. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed Nestlé to export additional infant formula into the U.S., and over time, Nestlé plans to bring in more than 42 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents. Operation Fly Formula, launched by President Biden, aims to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure its availability in stores, hospitals, and home health care providers. By September 16, Operation Fly Formula will have transported nearly 91 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S. The Biden Administration has also invoked the Defense Production Act, reached a consent agreement with Abbott Nutrition, and issued FDA guidance to ensure an adequate supply of safe infant formula for families.
