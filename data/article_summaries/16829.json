This article is a proclamation by President Barack Obama on the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA is a landmark law that aims to provide equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities. The proclamation celebrates the ADA's lasting legacy as a pillar of civil rights, but also acknowledges that there are still barriers preventing full participation of people with disabilities in society and the workforce. The Obama Administration is committed to leveling the playing field by recruiting, hiring, and retaining more workers with disabilities and connecting them to jobs in every part of the economy. The education system also needs to be inclusive and accessible for students with disabilities, and efforts are being made to build supportive classrooms and address bullying targeting these individuals. The Affordable Care Act provides protections for individuals with disabilities by making it illegal for insurers to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions or genetic information. The proclamation calls for the enforcement of the ADA, promotion of disability rights at home and abroad, and the creation of an inclusive society that values the contributions of all citizens, regardless of disability.
