The article discusses the High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program for the Chicago-St. Louis-Kansas City corridor. The total approximate funding for the project is $1,133,000,000, with the Illinois Department of Transportation and the Missouri Department of Transportation as the awardees. The upgraded corridor consists of 570 miles of track and connects Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City.

Currently, there are five daily round trips between Chicago and St. Louis, and two daily round trips between St. Louis and Kansas City. The long-term vision for the corridor is to reach speeds of 110 mph, with up to eight daily round trips between Chicago and St. Louis.

The Chicago-St. Louis segment will receive improvements funded by grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. These improvements will allow passenger rail service to operate at speeds of up to 110 mph, reducing travel time to approximately 4 hours. Track, signal systems, existing stations, and rail cars will be upgraded, along with the implementation of positive train control technology. Environmental work to support future service enhancements will also be funded.

For the St. Louis-Kansas City segment, improvements are expected to provide significant service reliability improvements. On-time performance is projected to increase from 18 percent in 2008 to 85 percent in five years. Funding will be provided for various construction projects, including the expansion of railroad bridges, universal crossovers, and improved grade crossings.
