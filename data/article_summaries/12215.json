The United States celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Republic of Cyprus' independence. The two countries share a strong partnership based on kinship and common ideals. The United States recognizes the historical friendship between the two peoples, and the contributions of Americans of Cypriot ancestry to the nation. The United States looks forward to deepening the relationship and strengthening cooperation in various areas of mutual interest. The US supports efforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus and reunify the island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation. The US is confident that a resolution meeting the aspirations of both communities is possible. Congratulations to the people of the Republic of Cyprus on this historic anniversary.
