The article discusses the U.S. support and reassurance initiatives for the Baltics and Central Europe in response to Russia's military intervention in Crimea and its efforts to destabilize Ukraine. The United States has taken action to reassure its allies and demonstrate its commitment to their security. This includes increasing the U.S. military presence in Europe, conducting exercises and training with allies and partners, improving infrastructure, enhancing prepositioning of U.S. equipment in Europe, building partner capacity for new NATO allies and other partners, and strengthening the capacity of non-NATO partners. The United States has also deployed forces to Europe, participated in exercises in the Baltic Sea, and partnered with National Guard forces in the region. NATO has launched exercises and implemented measures such as AWACS orbits over Poland and Romania, standing naval forces in the Baltic Sea, and revised planning. NATO is also providing support to Ukraine and strengthening its partnership with the country. These initiatives will be further discussed at the NATO Summit in Wales.
