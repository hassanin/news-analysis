President Barack Obama has proclaimed April 2009 as National Sexual Assault Awareness Month in the United States. The proclamation aims to raise awareness about sexual assault, prevent future crimes, and provide support to victims. Sexual assault is a pervasive issue that affects people of all ages and in all parts of the country. Studies have shown that a significant number of women have been raped in their lifetime, and rates of sexual assault remain high among high school and college students. Victims of sexual assault often face additional challenges in a closed campus environment. Many victims do not report their attacks to the police, and the effects of sexual assault can have long-lasting physical and emotional consequences. Victims require a range of services, including crisis intervention, hotlines, medical and criminal justice accompaniment, advocacy, and counseling. Landmark legislation, such as the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 and the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, has helped fund these services. The proclamation emphasizes the need to hold offenders accountable and ensure that victims are treated with sensitivity and that critical evidence is collected for successful prosecution. The Obama Administration supports efforts to increase understanding of the issue and urges Americans to create policies at work and school, engage in discussions with family and friends, and prioritize the prevention of sexual assault in their communities.
