In this statement, President Obama announces that he has signed into law H.R. 6523, the "Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011." The Act authorizes funding for defense, military construction, and national security-related energy programs. However, the President expresses his objection to two sections of the Act. Section 1032 prohibits the use of funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States, which the President sees as a challenge to the executive branch's authority to determine how and where to prosecute these detainees. Section 1033 restricts the transfer of detainees to foreign countries, interfering with the executive branch's ability to make foreign policy and national security determinations. Despite his objections, the President signed the Act due to the importance of authorizing appropriations for military activities. He pledges to work with Congress to repeal these restrictions, mitigate their effects, and oppose any future attempts to extend or expand them.
