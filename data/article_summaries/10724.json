Vice President Biden hosted a conference call with Governors to discuss the implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The call took place as the administration launched "Recovery Summer," which focuses on the increase in infrastructure projects funded by the Recovery Act that will occur throughout the country during the summer. The Recovery Act is expected to create or save 3.5 million jobs by the end of the year, with thousands of road, bridge, rail, and other infrastructure projects set to begin in the coming months. Governors Jennifer Granholm (D-MI), Sonny Perdue (R-GA), Pat Quinn (D-IL), Brian Schweitzer (D-MT), and Lt. Governor Jack Dalrymple (R-ND) participated in the call.
