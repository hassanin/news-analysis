The United States Supreme Court has confirmed that the draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, a case that ensures a woman's right to choose to have an abortion and protects the fundamental right to privacy, is genuine. Opponents of Roe aim to punish women and strip away their decision-making rights regarding their own bodies. Republican legislators in various states are using the law against women as a weapon. This puts the rights of all Americans at risk, as weakening the right to privacy could allow the government to interfere in personal decisions. It is crucial to fight for women and for the country in this critical time.
