Major American corporations, including Walmart, are celebrating the new tax cuts by giving their employees bonuses and raises. Walmart, for example, is granting its 1.5 million employees a well-deserved raise and sees tax reform as an opportunity to be more competitive globally. Other companies, such as Target, have also increased wages to retain employees. The tax cut has introduced an unexpected Era of Good Feelings, with a robust labor market pushing upward pressure on American wages. Companies like American Airlines, Comcast, JetBlue, AT&T, Bank of America, U.S. Bank, and Nationwide Insurance have all cited the new tax law as the reason for their bonuses and investments. The reduced corporate tax rate is seen as a monumental step to bring taxes paid by U.S. businesses in line with the rest of the industrialized world and is expected to drive economic growth and create good-paying jobs.
