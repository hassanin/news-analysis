He praised her as a passionate voice and a great leader in the environmental movement, highlighting her work in promoting a green economy and advocating for a cap on carbon emissions. Biden also mentioned their collaboration on the Violence Against Women Act and emphasized the value of having Boxer on his side in the Senate. Although he is sorry to see her go, he acknowledged that there are still two years left in her term and believes that two years of Boxer's leadership is equivalent to four to six years of any other Senator.
