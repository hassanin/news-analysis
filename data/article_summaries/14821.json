In this letter, President Barack Obama informs the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate that he has issued an Executive Order to address the use of significant malicious cyber-enabled activities that aim to undermine democratic processes or institutions. The order allows for the blocking of property and interests in property of individuals determined to be responsible for or complicit in cyber-enabled activities that originate from outside the United States and pose a significant threat to national security, foreign policy, economic health, or financial stability. The order also lists specific individuals whose property and interests in property are to be blocked. The President has delegated the authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to take necessary actions and employ powers granted by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to carry out the order's purposes. All US government agencies are directed to take appropriate measures to implement the order. The letter includes a copy of the Executive Order issued by the President.
