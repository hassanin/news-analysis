The US, alongside its allies and partners, is preparing severe economic measures to impose on Russia if it further invades Ukraine. These measures include financial sanctions and export controls. The export controls would restrict the export of sophisticated technologies that are essential inputs to Russia's strategic ambitions, such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, defense, aerospace, and other key sectors. The US believes that these export controls would hit Putin's strategic ambitions to industrialize the Russian economy. In terms of energy supplies, the US is working with European allies to ensure the security of supply and mitigate price shocks. They are collaborating with countries and companies around the world to identify additional volumes of non-Russian natural gas and are in discussions with major natural gas producers to surge output and allocate volumes to European buyers. The goal is to ensure alternative supplies covering a significant majority of the potential shortfall. The US is also engaging with major buyers and suppliers of LNG to ensure flexibility in contracts and storage to enable diversion to Europe if necessary. The US and the EU are aligned in their intention to impose massive consequences on Russia, and the convergence between the two on financial sanctions is remarkable. The US believes that the severe economic measures can change Putin's calculus and that Russia's dependence on oil and gas revenues makes it vulnerable to economic pressure. Furthermore, denying Russia access to Western technology would weaken its productive capacity and innovative potential.
