The Vice President has issued a statement expressing his support for the Justice for All Reauthorization Act. This act aims to address the issue of violence against women by providing $56 million to reduce the backlog of untested rape kits, offer housing protections for domestic violence victims, enhance forensic testing capabilities, and address the training and equipment needs of crime labs. The Vice President, who is also the author of the Violence Against Women Act, commends this bipartisan effort and highlights its support from victim advocates, law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and scientists across the nation.
