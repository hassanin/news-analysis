The President applauds the bipartisan majority of Senators who passed a bill to cut rates on federal student loans, saving undergraduates an average of more than $1,500 this year. The compromise meets the key principles of locking in low rates next year and not overcharging students to pay down the deficit. The President urges the House to pass the bill so that he can sign it into law and hopes that both parties will continue to work on bringing down the soaring costs of education and making it accessible for working families.
