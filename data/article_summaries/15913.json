The White House Press Secretary released a statement affirming that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is working and that lawsuits such as King v. Burwell will not hinder its progress. The statement asserts that the financial assistance provided by the ACA was the intention of Congress and is benefiting millions of Americans who can now afford health insurance. The lawsuit is described as a partisan attempt to undermine the ACA and deprive families of tax credits. The White House is confident that the Supreme Court will recognize the clear reading and intent of the law. It emphasizes that the ACA is already reducing the number of uninsured individuals and assures Americans that tax credits and affordable coverage will continue to be available during the open enrollment period.
