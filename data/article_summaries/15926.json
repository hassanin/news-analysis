The Obama Administration has announced a Clean Energy Investment Initiative with the goal of catalyzing $2 billion of private sector investment in solutions to climate change. The Department of Energy (DOE) will lead this initiative by leveraging its technical expertise, technologies, and programs to assist in understanding opportunities and needs for clean energy innovation. The DOE will work to mobilize philanthropists and impact investors to scale up investments in energy innovation. To kick off this initiative, the White House will host a Clean Energy Investment Summit later this spring. Several organizations, including the University of California Board of Regents, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Schmidt Family Foundation, and Wells Fargo, have already made announcements towards scaling up investment in clean energy innovation. The article also highlights existing progress made by the Obama Administration, such as investments by ARPA-E and the Solar Access to Public Capital working group, support for clean energy deployment by the DOE's Loan Programs Office, and the establishment of the Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation.
