This statement by President Obama, released on January 12, 2014, discusses the implementation of the First Step Agreement on the Islamic Republic of Iran's Nuclear Program. The agreement marks the first time in a decade that Iran has agreed to actions that halt progress on its nuclear program and roll back key parts of it. Starting from January 20th, Iran will eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium and dismantle some of the infrastructure that allows for enrichment. Iran has also agreed to limit its enrichment capability and allow for more frequent inspections of its nuclear sites. In return, the United States and its partners will provide modest relief from sanctions as long as Iran fulfills its obligations. The President emphasizes that imposing additional sanctions now would risk derailing the progress made through diplomacy. The goal is to pursue a comprehensive resolution that addresses concerns over Iran's nuclear program for the sake of national security and global peace.
