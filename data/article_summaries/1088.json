President Biden will host the Global Fund's Seventh Replenishment Conference on September 19, 2022, in New York City. The United States has been a founding contributor and the largest single donor to the Global Fund, contributing nearly $20 billion since 2002. The Global Fund, founded in 2002, is a financing mechanism that brings together governments, the private sector, and civil society to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria and strengthen health systems. Over the past 20 years, the Global Fund has invested over $53 billion, saving 44 million lives and reducing the death rate from the three diseases by more than half in low- and middle-income countries. The Global Fund has also responded to the COVID-19 pandemic through its COVID-19 Response Mechanism, providing grants for COVID-19 tests, treatments, and other critical elements for health systems. President Biden's FY 2023 budget includes a request for $2 billion for the Global Fund as part of a three-year Seventh Replenishment pledge of $6 billion. The Seventh Replenishment Conference aims to raise funds for the 2023-2025 grant cycle. The United States encourages all government donors to support the Global Fund Replenishment, and the private sector has been a key contributor to the Global Fund partnership. A successful Global Fund Replenishment is projected to save 20 million lives between 2024 and 2026, reduce the mortality rate by 64%, and avert more than 450 million infections. It is also expected to yield a return on investment of 1:31, contributing to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda.
