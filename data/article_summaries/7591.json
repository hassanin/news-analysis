Today, the White House convened a roundtable discussion with private sector leaders to discuss innovations that will improve maternal health and birth outcomes for pregnant women, postpartum women, and their infants. The discussion focused on investing in women's health and addressing the maternal mortality crisis, particularly for women of color and those in rural areas. The participants highlighted the contributions of the private sector, including increasing access to doula and midwifery services and culturally competent care. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a new Transforming Maternal Health (TMaH) Model, a 10-year payment and care-delivery model to support state Medicaid agencies in implementing a whole-person approach to pregnancy and postpartum care. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also announced a new maternal health collaborative and a funding opportunity for the State Maternal Health Innovation Program. Vice President Harris has been a leader in improving outcomes for women and families, introducing landmark bills and advocating for expanded postpartum coverage.
