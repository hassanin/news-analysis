The statement by NSC Spokesperson Caitlin Hayden acknowledges the 10th anniversary of the murder of American journalist Paul Klebnikov in Moscow, whose killers have not been brought to justice. Klebnikov's reporting on official corruption and graft brought attention to these issues. The statement calls for an end to impunity for crimes against journalists in Russia and supports the efforts of journalists worldwide who expose corruption and abuse of power. It emphasizes that the intimidation and murder of journalists go against democratic values and urges the Russian government to protect journalists and respect freedom of expression in accordance with international obligations.
