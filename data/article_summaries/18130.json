Vice President Joe Biden announced that the United States is providing an additional $135 million in humanitarian assistance to help feed civilians affected by the ongoing conflict in Syria. This brings the total amount of aid provided by the US since the start of the crisis to over $3 billion. The funding will be used to feed vulnerable people inside Syria, Syrian refugees in Turkey, and Syrian refugees in neighboring countries. The United States is grateful to Turkey for hosting an estimated 1.6 million refugees from Syria and has committed to resettling thousands of the most vulnerable refugees in the United States. The funding will primarily go to the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) to respond to ongoing emergency food needs in Syria and in countries hosting Syrian refugees, including Turkey. The WFP's operations feed millions of Syrians every month, both inside Syria and in neighboring countries. The funding also includes support for the Turkish Red Crescent to provide hot meals for Syrian refugees from Kobani. The United States remains committed to supporting relief agencies working to meet the needs of Syrians throughout the region.
