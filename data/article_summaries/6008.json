Yesterday, a tragic incident of gun violence occurred in the United States, resulting in the death of eight Americans, including children. The President, Jill, and others are offering their prayers and condolences to the families affected, as well as expressing gratitude towards the first responders. Federal, state, and local law enforcement are collaborating to investigate the attack, and the President has directed federal agencies to provide necessary support.

The assailant, equipped with an AR-15 style assault weapon, targeted innocent individuals in a shopping mall. This type of attack has unfortunately become all too common in the country, with approximately 200 mass shootings and over 14,000 deaths due to gun violence reported this year. Shockingly, gun violence is now the leading cause of death for American children.

Although some progress has been made through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and executive actions, such as state-level bans on assault weapons and the expansion of red flag laws, the President believes that more needs to be done to save lives. He calls on Congress to pass a bill that would ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, implement universal background checks, require safe storage, and end immunity for gun manufacturers. The President pledges to sign such a bill immediately, emphasizing the importance of taking stronger action to ensure the safety of American streets.
