In this letter, President Barack Obama states that he is continuing the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations beyond July 24, 2013. He explains that these organizations pose a significant threat to the stability of international political and economic systems. They are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous, infiltrating foreign governments and the international financial system. They weaken democratic institutions, undermine the rule of law, and disrupt economic markets. These organizations also contribute to violent conflicts and aid other dangerous individuals. As a result, President Obama determines that it is necessary to extend the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581.
