In this press gaggle, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest discusses a couple of announcements made by the administration. The first announcement is about the number of seniors who have received assistance purchasing prescription drugs through the Affordable Care Act. The statistics show that 7.3 million seniors have benefitted from this program, with a total of $8.9 billion spent on assistance. The second announcement is about food stamps and the Republican proposal to cut them. If the bill is passed, 4 million Americans would lose access to SNAP benefits. Earnest emphasizes that SNAP benefits primarily benefit children, the elderly, and the disabled, and that cutting food stamps would have a negative impact on their livelihoods. He also highlights the efficiency and economic benefits of the SNAP program. Earnest also briefly discusses the Supreme Court taking up the religious objection provision of the Affordable Care Act, Congress potentially passing additional sanctions on Iran, and the President's views on executive action and immigration. He concludes by mentioning the President's request to the Iranian regime to release American detainees and the need to resolve territorial disputes in the East China Sea diplomatically.
