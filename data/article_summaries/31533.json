President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Vermont and has ordered Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts. This is in response to a severe storm and flooding that occurred from October 29 to October 30, 2017. The Federal funding will be available to the State, eligible local governments, and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis. The funding will cover emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the storm and flooding in ten counties. It will also be available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the State and if further damage assessments warrant it. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
