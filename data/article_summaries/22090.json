Nicaragua and Uruguay have ratified the 2005 Amendment to the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials, making them the final two countries needed for the amendment to enter into force. This amendment requires states to secure their civilian nuclear material and criminalize nuclear smuggling. It also establishes responsibilities for states to notify others of potentially dangerous incidents involving nuclear material. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will hold review conferences to maintain focus on nuclear security. The United States commends the ratifying states and the IAEA for their efforts and encourages all countries to ratify the amendment.
