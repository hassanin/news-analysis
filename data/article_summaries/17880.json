The President met with NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and thanked him for his leadership and the contributions of NATO allies to peace and security. They discussed the ongoing NATO mission in Libya, where they are implementing the UN Security Council Resolution 1973 mandate to protect civilians from the violence of the Qadhafi regime. They agreed that the operation had saved countless lives and that NATO will continue to protect civilians as long as the regime continues to attack its own population. They also discussed the NATO mission in Afghanistan and the importance of a sustained NATO commitment as the transition to Afghan lead for security begins this year. The President announced that the next NATO Summit will be hosted in the United States in 2012.
