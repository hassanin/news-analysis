The Trump administration is strongly supporting the passage of H.R. 1677, also known as the "Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2018." The bill aims to provide additional tools to help end the ongoing tragedy in Syria and hold Syrian officials accountable for the slaughter of civilians and other atrocities. It seeks to deny the Assad regime and its proxies access to the international financial system and block the financial support that fuels the murder of innocent Syrians. The bill also aims to use economic sanctions and visa restrictions to hold accountable those responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes. The administration remains committed to objectives in Syria, such as liberating territory from ISIS control, delivering humanitarian aid, de-escalating violence, deterring chemical weapons use, and advancing a United Nations-led political resolution. The bill will be interpreted in line with these objectives and the protections provided under the American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002.
