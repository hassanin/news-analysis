The article is a memorandum from President Joseph R. Biden Jr. addressed to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security. The memorandum is titled "Preserving and Fortifying Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)." 

The memorandum begins by referencing a 2012 memorandum issued during the Obama-Biden Administration by the Secretary of Homeland Security. This memorandum, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) guidance, outlined how the Department of Homeland Security should enforce immigration laws against certain young people through the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. DACA deferred the removal of certain undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, have followed the law, and have either stayed in school or enlisted in the military. DACA allows eligible individuals to request temporary relief from removal and apply for temporary work permits. The purpose of DACA is to prioritize humanitarian concerns and provide work authorization for these individuals to support themselves, their families, and contribute to the economy.

The memorandum then states that the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, is directed to take all appropriate actions, consistent with applicable law, to preserve and fortify DACA.

The memorandum concludes with general provisions, stating that it does not impair the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, nor does it affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also clarifies that the memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized and directed to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
