In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. highlights the importance of National Adoption Month and celebrates families that provide safe and supportive homes through adoption. He expresses his commitment to helping families pay for the costs of adopting a child by calling for the adoption tax credit to be made fully refundable. The President also proposes extending the adoption tax credit to legal guardianships, including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other relatives, to make it easier for them to care for children in need. He emphasizes the need to address racial inequities in the child welfare system that disproportionately affect children of color. 

President Biden's Administration is also focused on fighting discrimination in the adoption process, particularly against LGBTQI+ families. Through an executive order, they are partnering with state child welfare agencies to remove barriers and biases that hinder LGBTQI+ families from adopting. The Department of Health and Human Services will provide training and assistance to better support LGBTQI+ youth in the foster care system and ensure they are placed in supportive environments. 

Additionally, the President aims to support older adolescents transitioning from the foster care system by increasing funding for the John H. Chafee Successful Transition to Adulthood program by 70%. This program provides resources for housing, education, and financial stability to help these youth prepare for adulthood. 

President Biden concludes by recognizing and expressing gratitude to adoptive and kinship families, foster families, and professionals involved in improving the lives of children. He encourages all Americans to honor National Adoption Month by helping children and youth in their communities find permanent homes where they can thrive.
