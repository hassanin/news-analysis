President Obama has issued a statement on the adoption of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which aims to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and ensure that its nuclear program is used for peaceful purposes. Today, on the Adoption Day of the JCPOA, Iran will begin taking steps to implement its commitments under the agreement. These steps include removing centrifuges and infrastructure, reducing its enriched uranium stockpile, and rendering the Arak heavy-water reactor unusable. These measures will effectively eliminate all four pathways Iran could use to develop enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon. The President has directed relevant executive departments and agencies to begin preparations to implement U.S. commitments in the JCPOA, including providing relief from nuclear-related sanctions once the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verifies Iran's compliance. The U.S. will closely monitor Iran's adherence to its commitments and work with the IAEA and other JCPOA participants to ensure full compliance. The President welcomes this progress and emphasizes the need to fully implement the resolution addressing concerns over Iran's nuclear program.
