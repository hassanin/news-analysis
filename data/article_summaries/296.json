President Joseph R. Biden has proclaimed May 21 through May 27, 2022, as National Safe Boating Week in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of responsible and safe boating practices as more Americans take to the water during warmer weather. While many Americans enjoy recreational boating, preventable accidents resulting in tragic deaths and injuries occur each year. Taking a State-offered boating safety course is recommended to minimize accidents, as most boating fatalities involve operators who did not have proper boating safety education. The Coast Guard Auxiliary and America's Boating Club offer free assistance to ensure vessels are safe and operators have the necessary tools to operate them safely. Basic boating safety procedures, such as wearing a life jacket, are essential to protect oneself and loved ones. In 2020, three-quarters of boating deaths were drownings, and the majority of victims were not wearing life jackets. It is also important to avoid alcohol or drugs when operating a boat, as alcohol is a significant contributing factor in boating deaths. Wearing an engine cut-off switch link can prevent accidents by stopping the boat's engine if the operator falls overboard. The proclamation pays tribute to the United States Coast Guard and the various partners who help save lives and protect individuals from accidents on the water. By adhering to safe boating practices, Americans can enjoy the boating season while ensuring their safety. The proclamation encourages all Americans who participate in boating activities to learn more about safe boating practices and take advantage of boating safety education opportunities.
