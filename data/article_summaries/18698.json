The Obama Administration has announced over $375 million in support for next-generation high schools. The White House Summit on Next Generation High Schools highlighted efforts to reinvent the high school experience and better prepare students for college and career success. The announcements showcased a broad response to the President's call for more personalized and active learning, real-world and hands-on experiences, deeper ties to post-secondary institutions, and expanded STEM opportunities for underrepresented students. The Summit also discussed the significant reduction in the percentage of students who do not complete high school on-time and the need for access to rigorous coursework. The Administration announced new resources and investments, including $20 million in federal grants for high schools serving low-income students. Various foundations, non-profits, education leaders, and companies also committed to supporting next-generation high schools through the development and launch of new schools, funding, and expanding access to rigorous courses and career pathways. The Summit was preceded by a National Science Foundation forum on next-generation learning.
