The global market for electric vehicles (EVs) is growing rapidly, but the United States is falling behind in manufacturing and infrastructure. President Biden aims to change this by investing in the American Jobs Plan. The plan aims to strengthen the US EV industry, create jobs, and make EVs more affordable. It will drive demand for EVs through incentives and support the manufacturing and supply chains for EV parts. The plan also includes the establishment of a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030 and investments in research and innovation. Overall, the plan aims to position the US as a leader in EV manufacturing, infrastructure, deployment, and innovation.
