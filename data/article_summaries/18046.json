President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Texas due to the impact of Hurricane Alex. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The funding will provide assistance to affected individuals, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. Federal funding is also available for state and local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, to cover emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding. Bradley M. Harris has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance through DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling the FEMA hotline. Additional designations for assistance may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. The FEMA hotline will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week until further notice.
