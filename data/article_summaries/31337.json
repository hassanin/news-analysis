On March 29, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum granting permission to TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. to construct, connect, operate, and maintain pipeline facilities at the international border of the United States and Canada in Montana for the import of oil from Canada to the United States. This permit supersedes a previous permit issued in 2017. The memorandum outlines various conditions and requirements for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the pipeline facilities, including inspections by federal, state, and local agencies, the removal of facilities upon termination of the permit, and the right of the United States to take possession and control of the facilities for national security purposes. The permittee is also responsible for acquiring necessary permits and authorizations, indemnifying the United States for any liability arising from the facilities, and providing reports and information to the President or his designee. The permit expires in 5 years if construction has not commenced by that time, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States.
