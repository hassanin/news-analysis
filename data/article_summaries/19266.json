President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Iowa and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between June 26 and July 7, 2014. The federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Audubon, Black Hawk, Butler, Cedar, Des Moines, Grundy, Hamilton, Hardin, Ida, Iowa, Jackson, Jasper, Johnson, Jones, Keokuk, Lee, Linn, Mahaska, Muscatine, Poweshiek, Tama, and Washington. Hazard mitigation measures will also be eligible for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Michael L.
