President Obama expresses his sadness over the passing of Ted Sorensen, whom he got to know after Sorensen endorsed his campaign early on. Sorensen was known for his quick wit, serious purpose, and determination to uphold America's highest ideals. From desegregating a pool in Nebraska to playing a key role in electing and advising President Kennedy, Sorensen lived an extraordinary life that made the country and the world more equal, just, and secure. His legacy will live on through his writings, the causes he championed, and those inspired by the promise of a new frontier. President Obama extends his condolences to Sorensen's family.
