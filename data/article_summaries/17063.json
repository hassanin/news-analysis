President Obama announced new executive actions to fulfill promises to service members, veterans, and their families. The five priorities the administration is focused on include delivering quality healthcare, ensuring opportunities for pursuing the American Dream, providing resources for veterans, protecting the rights of all veterans, and eliminating the disability claims backlog. Some of the executive actions include strengthening access to mental health care for service members, improving the transition between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, and making it easier for veterans to obtain mortgage interest rate reductions. The President also highlighted progress made in reducing homelessness among veterans and called for community action to support service members and their families.
