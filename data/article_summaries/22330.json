The White House has launched the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, which involves 13 major companies pledging their commitment to reducing emissions and promoting sustainability. The companies include Alcoa, Apple, Bank of America, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Cargill, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft, PepsiCo, UPS, and Walmart. These companies represent over $1.3 trillion in revenue in 2014 and have a combined market capitalization of at least $2.5 trillion. The pledge includes goals such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing renewable energy usage, improving energy efficiency, and reducing water consumption. The companies also aim to set an example for other businesses to join the pledge and will continue to make further commitments in the future.
