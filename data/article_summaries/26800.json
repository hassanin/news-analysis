Vice President Mike Pence visited Central Florida to participate in a briefing on hurricane rescue and recovery efforts. He then visited a disaster relief center and a local church that was assisting in distributing goods to Puerto Rico for the Hurricane Maria relief effort. Pence helped volunteers pack cases of water into trucks and praised their generosity. He is also planning to travel to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to survey storm damage and meet with affected community members.
