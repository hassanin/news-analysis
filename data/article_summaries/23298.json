The White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, announced a comprehensive global health strategy led by President Obama. The strategy focuses on solving the most serious problems facing the world's poorest people, such as extreme poverty and preventable diseases. The initiative aims to improve child and maternal health, family planning, neglected tropical diseases, and HIV/AIDS. The President's 2010 budget includes funding for these initiatives, with a total investment of $63 billion over six years. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of building partnerships and cooperation with other countries and organizations. Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew joined Gibbs to make the announcement and discussed the critical role of global health in foreign policy and national security. The budget will be released later that week, providing more details on funding and specific programs.
