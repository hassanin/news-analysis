This memorandum, issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., emphasizes the importance of ensuring a safe return to full-time, in-person school for the nation's children. The memorandum highlights the availability of vaccines for school staff and eligible students, as well as the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on preventing the spread of COVID-19 in schools. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and other federal pandemic relief funds are mentioned as resources to support the safe reopening and operation of schools. The memorandum acknowledges the efforts of some state and local officials in implementing prevention and mitigation strategies, but also expresses concern about policies and laws that interfere with the ability of schools to adopt safety protocols aligned with CDC recommendations. The memorandum directs the Secretary of Education to assess the actions taken by governors and other officials to ensure a safe return to school and consider possible enforcement actions. The memorandum concludes with general provisions and the directive to publish it in the Federal Register.
