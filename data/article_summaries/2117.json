President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued a proclamation to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States of noncitizens who were physically present in the Republic of India during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry. This action is being taken due to the widespread transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, in India. The CDC has determined that India accounts for over one-third of new global cases, with a rapid acceleration in the number of new cases. Variants of the virus, including B.1.617, are also circulating in India. The proclamation provides exceptions for certain categories of individuals, such as U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and immediate family members of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. The proclamation will remain in effect until terminated by the President. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will regularly assess the situation and make recommendations on whether to continue, modify, or terminate the proclamation.
