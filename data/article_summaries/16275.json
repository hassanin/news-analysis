Nutter believes that the comprehensive set of ideas proposed in the act, such as investing in teachers, police officers, and firefighters, fixing infrastructure, and assisting veterans, is what the country needs to stimulate the economy and help the unemployed. He urges Congress to take immediate action and pass the legislation, emphasizing that millions of Americans are relying on them to do so. Nutter highlights that the act includes elements that both Democrats and Republicans have supported in the past, making it easier to garner bipartisan support. He concludes by stating that passing the American Jobs Act should be a priority in order to get Americans and Philadelphians back to work as quickly as possible.
