The Trump Administration, the House Committee on Ways and Means, and the Senate Committee on Finance have developed a unified framework for tax reform. This framework aims to create a pro-American tax code that supports middle-class families, defends workers, protects jobs, and puts America first. It focuses on broadening the tax base, closing loopholes, and growing the economy. The goal is to provide a level playing field for American workers and businesses, making them competitive on the world stage. The framework will serve as a template for the tax-writing committees to develop legislation through a transparent and inclusive process. The committees will also work on additional reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of tax laws. The full framework and a one-page overview are available for reference.
