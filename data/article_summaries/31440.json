President Trump held a meeting in the Roosevelt Room to discuss the release of the School Safety Commission's official report. The report includes nearly 100 detailed recommendations on how to prevent school shootings and improve school safety. The recommendations are based on input from families, educators, mental health practitioners, law enforcement, and federal, state, and local leaders. Some of the recommendations include fixing mental health laws, adopting extreme risk protection orders, launching a No Notoriety campaign, and allowing trained school personnel to have access to firearms. The President thanked Secretary Betsy DeVos for leading the Commission and expressed gratitude to the families of school shooting victims for their courage and involvement in the process. The meeting also touched on the recent ban on bump stocks and the need for accountability and quick response to warning signs.
