On January 21, 2009, the White House released a statement announcing that President Obama had signed two Executive Orders and three Memoranda. These documents were aimed at fulfilling his campaign promises of making government more responsible, accountable, and transparent. 

One of the Presidential Memoranda announced a pay freeze for White House senior staff, allowing the budget to stretch further during the economic crisis. The Executive Order on Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel set rules to ensure that government officials do not accept gifts from lobbyists, restricts the revolving door between government and private sector jobs, and requires government hiring to be based on qualifications rather than political connections. 

The President also issued two Memoranda on transparency and open government. These directed all members of the administration to operate under principles of openness, transparency, and citizen engagement. The Memorandum on Transparency instructed senior officials to produce an Open Government Directive within 120 days, while the Memorandum on the Freedom of Information Act instructed the Attorney General to issue new guidelines to implement these principles.

Lastly, the Executive Order on Presidential Records aimed to provide greater access to historic documents. It limited the power to assert executive privilege for records to only the President, preventing potential abuse. The order also required the Attorney General and the White House Counsel to review claims of executive privilege to ensure they are warranted by the Constitution.
