President Biden has signed a National Security Memorandum focused on combating illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and associated labor abuses. IUU fishing threatens the biodiversity and food security of coastal communities. It is also interconnected with other security challenges and criminal activities such as trafficking in persons, forced labor, and wildlife trafficking. The memorandum directs departments and agencies to address IUU fishing through increased coordination, engagement with stakeholders, enforcement actions, and research on labor practices. The United States will also launch an IUU Fishing Action Alliance to bring together countries to commit to taking urgent action against IUU fishing. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will issue a proposed rule to enhance its capabilities to combat IUU fishing and counter forced labor in the seafood supply chain. NOAA is also finalizing a five-year strategic plan and will work directly with partner countries, including Senegal, Ecuador, Panama, Taiwan, and Vietnam, to combat IUU fishing. The memorandum does not specifically target any one country, but it notes that China is a leading contributor to IUU fishing worldwide and calls on China to fulfill its commitments and actively participate in fighting IUU fishing. This is the first National Security Memorandum addressing IUU fishing, and the administration is working with Congress to allocate adequate resources for its implementation.
