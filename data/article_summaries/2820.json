The Biden Administration is launching a six-week campaign to encourage Americans to get their updated COVID-19 vaccine. The campaign will focus on reaching seniors and communities that were heavily impacted by the virus. Efforts will be made to make it more convenient for seniors and high-risk communities to get vaccinated, including expanding the number of locations offering the vaccine and setting up pop-up vaccine clinics at community gatherings. Additional funding will be provided to community health centers and organizations to increase the pace of vaccinations. Nursing homes will also be required to offer vaccines to their residents, and those with low vaccination rates may face enforcement actions. Pop-up vaccination clinics will be held across the country, and various organizations will host community-based clinics in different cities. The campaign also aims to increase awareness of the vaccine through paid media, including TV and digital ads. Additionally, a targeted paid media effort will urge older Americans and those with chronic conditions to seek treatment if they contract COVID-19.
