The White House held a press briefing on June 3, 2009, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Senior administration officials, including Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, speechwriter Ben Rhodes, and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Denis McDonough, discussed the structure and content of President Obama's upcoming speech in Cairo. The speech aimed to continue the dialogue between the United States and the Muslim world, emphasizing mutual respect and interests. It covered a range of topics, including violent extremism, the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Israeli-Palestinian issue, as well as broader issues such as democracy, human rights, and economic development. The officials also discussed the President's meetings with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and the efforts made to ensure the speech reached a wide audience through various platforms and translations. The officials addressed reports of a new message from Osama bin Laden, stating that it was consistent with previous messages from al Qaeda and aimed at upstaging President Obama's outreach efforts. They assured the American people that everything was being done to protect them and emphasized that the speech was part of an ongoing dialogue, not a one-time event.
