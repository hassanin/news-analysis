The Director of the National Economic Council, Gene B. Sperling, issued a statement expressing concern for the 1.3 million Americans who have had their unemployment insurance cut off. He urges Congress to make restoring emergency unemployment insurance their first priority in the new year. Sperling explains that failing to extend this insurance will negatively impact 14 million Americans, including the 4.9 million workers directly affected and their approximately 9 million family members. On the other hand, extending the benefits is estimated to lead to 200,000 jobs and additional economic growth. Sperling argues against the notion that those experiencing long-term unemployment are solely at fault, highlighting the stories of responsible Americans who have been affected. He emphasizes that this assistance is temporary and designed to taper off as unemployment decreases. Sperling urges Congress to support the bipartisan Reed-Heller bill, which would temporarily extend emergency unemployment insurance for three months and provide benefits for over 2 million Americans.
