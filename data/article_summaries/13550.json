In this article, President Barack Obama issues a presidential determination to waive the restriction on providing funds to the Palestinian Authority. He certifies that it is important to the national security interests of the United States to waive the provisions of section 7040(a) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2010. This waiver allows funds appropriated to carry out Chapter 4 of Part II of the Foreign Assistance Act to be provided to the Palestinian Authority. The Secretary of State is directed to transmit this determination to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
