This article is a notice from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. The national emergency was declared in 1995 due to the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, which were deemed a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Over the years, several executive orders were issued to impose sanctions on Iran in response to this threat. Although certain actions were taken by Iran under the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) between the P5+1 and Iran, which temporarily halted and rolled back parts of Iran's nuclear program, the Government of Iran still poses a threat to the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 1995 is being continued for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
