The White House recently held a listening session to address the harms caused by tech platforms and the need for greater accountability. The session focused on six key areas of concern: competition, privacy, youth mental health, misinformation and disinformation, illegal and abusive conduct, and algorithmic discrimination and lack of transparency. Experts and practitioners discussed various issues, including anti-competitive conduct by large platforms, the collection of personal data, the impact on public safety, unequal access to opportunities, and the negative effects of social media on young people's mental health. The White House officials expressed their commitment to addressing these concerns through legislative reforms and bipartisan collaboration. The Biden-Harris Administration announced core principles for reform, emphasizing the need for enhanced competition and tech platform accountability.
