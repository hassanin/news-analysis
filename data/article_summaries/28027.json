During a summit in Lima, Peru, Vice President Mike Pence announced that the United States will provide an additional $16 million in humanitarian aid to support Venezuelans who have fled the crisis in their country and are now in Colombia. The funding will be used to provide support for basic needs such as potable water, shelter, and other supplies. Pence called on America's allies in the region to join in the humanitarian effort. The Vice President also criticized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro for turning Venezuela's democracy into a dictatorship and causing a wave of corruption, crime, and poverty. He called on the international community to support the restoration of democracy in Venezuela and to pressure the Maduro regime to allow humanitarian aid into the country. Several opposition leaders from Venezuela were present at the summit, and they expressed their gratitude for the international support and called for the international community to not recognize the upcoming presidential election in Venezuela, which they consider to be a fraud.
