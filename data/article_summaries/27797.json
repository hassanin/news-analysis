In his remarks at the Foreign Policy event, President Trump expressed his commitment to the future of stability, prosperity, and liberty for the people of Venezuela. He criticized the Maduro regime for caring more about their own power and money than the welfare of their people. Trump highlighted the devastating effects of socialism in Venezuela, including starvation, lack of medicine, and human rights abuses. He called for a peaceful and constitutional transition of power, free and fair elections, and the provision of humanitarian aid to the Venezuelan people. Trump also emphasized the need for international pressure on the Cuban regime, which he believes is propping up Maduro's regime. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and several Latin American leaders also spoke, expressing their support for a democratic transition in Venezuela and calling for international solidarity.
