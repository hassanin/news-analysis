In this speech, President Biden expresses gratitude to the participants of a conference on global health and highlights the importance of saving lives and promoting health and dignity for all communities. He commends the Global Fund for its work in saving 50 million lives and reducing the death rate of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The President announces significant pledges from various countries, including the United States' commitment to donate $1 billion for every $2 billion pledged by the rest of the world. This will result in an additional $6 billion contribution from the United States, bringing the overall global pledge to $14 billion. President Biden emphasizes the impact of these contributions, expecting a 31-fold return on investment in terms of health gains and economic returns. He calls for further efforts to save another 20 million lives and reduce mortality rates from these diseases by 64% in the next four years. The President also acknowledges the contribution of frontline health workers and outlines the various areas where the funds will be utilized, such as improving surveillance capabilities, strengthening health supply chains, and addressing gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive rights. President Biden also mentions the United States' ongoing investments in initiatives like PEPFAR, the President's Malaria Initiative, and efforts to combat tuberculosis. He emphasizes the need for equity and access to care and treatment for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. President Biden concludes by urging continued commitment and collaboration to overcome health inequities, barriers to access, and to ultimately eliminate AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.
