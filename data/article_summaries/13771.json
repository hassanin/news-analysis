The White House has launched the Presidential Innovation Fellows program, selecting 18 individuals from nearly 700 applicants to work on five projects aimed at supporting entrepreneurs, small businesses, and the economy while improving how the Federal Government serves the American people. The program aims to leverage the expertise of private sector innovators to tackle challenges that could provide immediate benefits and cost-savings. The projects include Blue Button for America, RFP-EZ, MyGov, The 20% Initiative, and Open Data Initiatives. The Fellows will spend six months in Washington working on these projects.
