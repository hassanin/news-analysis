On Friday, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House Public Engagement Director Cedric Richmond hosted a virtual roundtable with LGBTQ+ leaders and gun violence survivors and advocates to mark the fifth anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando. They observed a moment of silence to honor the 49 individuals who lost their lives in the tragedy and discussed the impact of gun violence on LGBTQ+ communities. The participants highlighted the high levels of violence faced by transgender people, particularly transgender women of color, and the role of firearms in anti-transgender homicides. They also discussed the intersection of gun safety and the prevention of LGBTQ+ youth suicide. Rice and Richmond expressed gratitude for the participants' leadership and advocacy, reaffirming President Biden's commitment to LGBTQ+ equality and ending the gun violence epidemic. They urged the Senate to pass the Equality Act and bipartisan legislation to reduce gun violence.
