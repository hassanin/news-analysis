This article is a press release from the White House announcing the establishment of the Interagency Group on Insular Areas (IGIA). The IGIA is created within the Department of the Interior and its purpose is to address policies concerning Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The IGIA consists of the heads of executive departments, designated executive agencies, and the Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs. The Secretary of the Interior and the Deputy Assistant to the President serve as co-chairs of the IGIA. The IGIA's functions include advising the President on policies concerning the Insular Areas, soliciting information and advice from Governors and other elected officials, as well as representatives of entities or individuals, and reviewing and providing advice on policy or policy implementation actions affecting the Insular Areas. The IGIA is also responsible for submitting annual reports and providing recommendations on federal programs and policies affecting the Insular Areas. The heads of executive departments and agencies are required to assist and provide information to the IGIA, and each department and agency is responsible for its own expenses in participating in the IGIA. The order is implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. This executive order supersedes a previous executive order from 2003.
