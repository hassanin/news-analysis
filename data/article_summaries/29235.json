President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Oklahoma and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Muskogee, Tulsa, and Wagoner. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for debris removal and emergency protective measures on a cost-sharing basis. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for cost-sharing funding. Gerard M. Stolar has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated after assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will be operational seven days a week until further notice. For more information, the FEMA News Desk can be contacted.
