President Obama has signed a presidential determination authorizing the admission of up to 80,000 refugees in fiscal year 2010. The breakdown of these admissions by region is as follows: Africa - 15,500; East Asia - 17,000; Europe/Central Asia - 2,500; Latin America/Caribbean - 5,000; Near East/South Asia - 35,000; and Unallocated Reserve - 5,000. The Obama Administration aims to maintain a robust refugee admissions program despite the challenges posed by the recent economic downturn. They are conducting a review of the program to strengthen support for both refugees and the communities where they are resettled.
