President Biden has announced new actions to conserve and restore lands and waters across the United States. This includes establishing two new national monuments, Avi Kwa Ame in Nevada and Castner Range in Texas. The President has also directed the Secretary of Commerce to consider expanding protections for the Pacific Remote Islands. These commitments are part of the administration's goal to conserve 30% of U.S. ocean by 2030. The actions build on the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to advance conservation and environmental stewardship. Additional measures include the release of the Ocean Climate Action Plan, guidance on wildlife corridors, and funding for conservation projects. The administration is also partnering with philanthropic organizations to support the conservation efforts of Tribal Nations and announcing grants for wildfire risk reduction and wildlife conservation.
