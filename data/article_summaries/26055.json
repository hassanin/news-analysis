President Donald J. Trump has signed an executive order to establish discipline and accountability in the environmental review and permitting process for infrastructure projects. The old system was seen as fragmented, inefficient, and unpredictable. Trump aims to modernize the outdated system and remove roadblocks to improved infrastructure. He has made infrastructure a priority and has taken action to rebuild America, including replacing crumbling infrastructure with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways.
