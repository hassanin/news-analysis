In this Oval Office briefing, President Biden begins by announcing positive news about retail sales surging by 9.8% and auto sales increasing by 15% due to the $1,400 stimulus checks. He credits the success to the efforts of those in the room and expresses gratitude for their support in passing the American Rescue Plan. The President also highlights the creation of 900,000 jobs in March, the most in the first two months of any administration in American history. He acknowledges that there is still a long way to go, with 8 million jobs still needed to recover from the pandemic. 

President Biden then expresses his gratitude to the Asian American, Hawaiian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders community, emphasizing the diversity within this group and the need for a whole-of-government response to address their needs. He mentions his commitment to racial equity and the recent passage of the Hate Crimes Act with overwhelming bipartisan support. 

The President jokes about Senator Hirono's ability to secure 98 votes for the Act and assigns her the task of handling the jobs bill. He concludes by expressing his anticipation for the discussion with the Caucus and informs the press that he will be speaking to President Putin after the meeting.
