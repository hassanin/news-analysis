In a speech delivered by LTG H.R. McMaster, he discusses the challenges faced by the United States in terms of national security. He identifies three main challenges: revisionist powers that are undermining the post-World War II order, rogue regimes that defy international norms and pursue weapons of mass destruction, and barbaric non-state actors that spread ignorance and use violence. McMaster highlights the need for integrated strategies that utilize all elements of national power, including diplomatic, military, economic, and intelligence efforts. He also mentions the importance of addressing Iran's destabilizing behavior and malign activities, rather than solely focusing on the Iran Nuclear Deal. McMaster emphasizes the role of organizations like FDD and the media in bringing awareness to these threats, and calls for the support and collaboration of allies and partners in defending American interests.
