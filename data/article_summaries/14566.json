President Barack Obama issued a proclamation to modify the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. This modification is in line with the commitment made by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies to reduce applied tariff rates to 5 percent or less on 54 environmental goods by the end of 2015. The modification will be effective from December 31, 2015.
