Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the U.S. Embassy in London, emphasizing the need for global collaboration on the safe and responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI). She highlighted the potential benefits of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, and climate change, but also acknowledged the potential risks and threats it poses, including cyberattacks and bio-weapons. Harris emphasized the importance of managing these dangers and ensuring that AI is used in a way that protects individuals, communities, institutions, and vulnerable populations. She announced several initiatives and commitments, including the establishment of the United States AI Safety Institute, the creation of voluntary company commitments for responsible AI practices, and the call for legislation that strengthens AI safety without stifling innovation. Harris also emphasized the need for collaboration with civil society groups, philanthropies, and international partners to promote AI safety and equity worldwide. She concluded by urging leaders to seize the opportunity and work together to build a future where AI advances equity, protects fundamental freedoms and rights, and serves the public interest.
