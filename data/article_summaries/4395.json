President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued a memorandum to the Secretary of Energy regarding the domestic production of solar photovoltaic modules and module components. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of having a robust and sustainable domestic industrial base to support the clean energy economy, national security, and critical infrastructure. President Biden determines that solar photovoltaic modules and module components are essential to national defense and that the United States industry cannot meet the demand for these items in a timely manner without presidential action. Therefore, he authorizes the expansion of domestic production capabilities for solar photovoltaic modules and module components by waiving certain requirements of the Defense Production Act of 1950. The memorandum instructs the Secretary of Energy to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
