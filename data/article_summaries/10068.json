The President issued a statement praising the Senate's bipartisan agreement to extend middle-class tax cuts, which he believes will benefit 98% of Americans and 97% of small business owners. He acknowledges that neither party got everything they wanted, but believes this agreement is the right thing for the country. The President also states that this agreement will help grow the economy and reduce the deficit by investing in the middle class and asking the wealthy to pay more. He highlights that this agreement builds on previous efforts to reduce the deficit and will require millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share for the first time in twenty years. The President acknowledges that there is more work to be done to reduce the deficit and expresses his willingness to do it. He emphasizes his commitment to fighting for the middle class and creating an economy that grows from the middle out.
