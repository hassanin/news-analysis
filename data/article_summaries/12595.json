President Obama will establish the César E. Chávez National Monument in Keene, California on October 8th, 2012. The monument will be designated under the Antiquities Act and will be located on the property known as Nuestra Señora Reina de la Paz (Our Lady Queen of Peace), or La Paz. The site is significant as it served as the national headquarters of the United Farm Workers (UFW) and the home and workplace of civil rights icon César Chávez and his family. It also includes Chávez's grave site. The National Chávez Center, in collaboration with the United Farm Workers of America, the César Chávez Foundation, and Chávez's family, offered to donate certain properties at La Paz to establish the national monument. The monument will be managed by the National Park Service in consultation with the National Chávez Center and the César Chávez Foundation. This will be the fourth National Monument designated by President Obama using the Antiquities Act.
