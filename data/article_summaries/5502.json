The President is focused on addressing the increased gas prices caused by Putin's price hike and is committed to helping Americans find affordable fuel options. The Administration's strategy includes promoting the development of homegrown biofuels to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and achieve long-term energy independence. The President plans to increase fuel supplies, provide more consumer choices, and lower gasoline prices. One key step is allowing the sale of E15 gasoline, which contains a 15 percent ethanol blend. These actions aim to alleviate the impact of the price hike and support the transition to clean energy, while also creating jobs and supporting American agriculture and manufacturing.
