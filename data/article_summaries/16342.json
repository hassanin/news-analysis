President Obama has declared a major disaster for the Santa Clara Pueblo and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding in July 2013. The declaration allows for federal funding to supplement the Tribe's emergency work, and additional designations may be made if requested and warranted. Nancy M. Casper has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
