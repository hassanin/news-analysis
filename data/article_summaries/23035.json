President Obama met with a family struggling to afford college costs and emphasized the need to eliminate wasteful spending in the federal student loan program. He discussed his proposal to end taxpayer subsidies to banks and the private Federal Family Education Loans program, which costs the American people $5 billion annually. The President aims to cut these subsidies and reinvest the savings in making college more affordable. He plans to expand the alternative Direct Loan program, which is more reliable and efficient, and save $48 billion over the next decade. This money will be reinvested in Pell Grant scholarships for students. President Obama also wants to restore Pell Grants to their previous value and make them an entitlement, providing $116 billion over the next decade. He aims to prevent any decrease in the size of Pell Grants and ensure they grow faster than inflation. Additionally, the President plans to cut taxes on college tuition by making the American Opportunity Tax Credit permanent. Lastly, he proposes a five-year, $2.5 billion fund to improve college access and help universities graduate more students.
