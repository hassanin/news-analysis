In a meeting held in the Situation Room, the President and his national security team, along with commanders and diplomats in the field, discussed the likelihood of another terror attack in Kabul. Despite the threats, they reported that the evacuation operation at the Kabul Airport is ongoing, with the US military airlifting thousands of people every few hours. Priority is being given to evacuating American citizens and efforts are being made to safely transport them to the airport. The President also directed the Secretary of State to continue diplomatic efforts with international partners to assist third-country nationals and Afghans with visas to leave the country after the US military presence ends. Additionally, plans to target ISIS-K were discussed, with the next few days expected to be the most dangerous period of the mission. The President reaffirmed his approval of all necessary authorities to protect troops, and commanders confirmed they have the required resources. The meeting included several senior officials such as Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, Chairman Milley, and National Security Advisor Sullivan.
