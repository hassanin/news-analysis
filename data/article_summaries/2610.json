President Joe Biden has declared a state of emergency in New York due to the remnants of Hurricane Ida. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local response efforts. The Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will coordinate disaster relief efforts to help alleviate the hardships caused by the emergency. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources as needed to mitigate the impacts of the emergency. The federal funding for emergency protective measures, such as evacuation and shelter support, will be provided at 75 percent. Lai Sun Yee has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
