The article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, dated February 25, 2015, regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Cuba. The national emergency was initially declared on March 1, 1996, in response to the destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft by the Cuban government. The emergency was extended and expanded in scope on February 26, 2004, to deny support to the Cuban government. The Cuban government has not demonstrated a willingness to refrain from using excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft engaged in memorial activities or peaceful protests near Cuba. Unauthorized entry of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is also seen as detrimental to U.S. foreign policy. As a result, the national emergency and the emergency authority regarding the regulation of vessel movement are being continued. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
