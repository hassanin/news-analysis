The Biden-Harris Administration will invest $7.4 billion from the American Rescue Plan to recruit and hire public health workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health challenges. The funding will create tens of thousands of jobs to support vaccinations, testing, contact tracing, and community outreach, as well as strengthen America's public health infrastructure. $4.4 billion will be allocated to allow states and localities to expand their public health departments, including funding for disease intervention specialists, school nurses, and the development of the next generation of public health leaders. Additionally, CDC will use $3 billion to create a new grant program to expand, train, and modernize the public health workforce at the state and local levels. The funding will prioritize recruiting individuals from the communities they will serve and from underrepresented backgrounds. This investment builds on the President's announcement of $250 million to help community-based organizations hire workers for vaccination outreach in high-risk communities.
