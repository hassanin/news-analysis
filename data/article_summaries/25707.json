The United States strongly condemns the involvement of the Maduro regime in the death of Venezuelan opposition councilman Fernando Alban. Alban was taken into custody upon his return from the United Nations General Assembly, where he advocated for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela. He died three days later while in the custody of Venezuela's intelligence service. The Trump Administration will continue to increase pressure on the Maduro regime until democracy is restored in Venezuela. The United States is also calling for the immediate release of all Venezuelan political prisoners and for the Maduro regime to take credible steps to reestablish democracy and prevent further suffering and bloodshed.
