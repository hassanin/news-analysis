The Vice President has issued a statement expressing support for the Justice for All Reauthorization Act, which was recently signed into law. The Act will allocate $56 million to address the national backlog of untested rape kits, provide housing protections for victims of domestic violence, enhance forensic testing capabilities, and address the training and equipment needs of crime labs. The Vice President, who authored the Violence Against Women Act, commends this bipartisan effort and highlights the support it has received from victim advocates, law enforcement, prosecutors, and scientists across the country. The Act aims to improve the safety and security of all citizens.
