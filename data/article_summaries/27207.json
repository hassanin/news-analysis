President Trump and his administration are taking action to address the skills gap and provide training and education for American workers. They are launching a new initiative aimed at improving vocational education and job training for high school students and mid-career workers. The initiative will involve the formation of a National Council on the American Worker, which will bring together insights from government, industry, and academia to modernize the nation's education and job-training system. The administration expects this initiative to lead to at least 500,000 new career opportunities for students and workers. Several companies, including IBM, FedEx, and Lockheed Martin, have pledged to support this effort by expanding apprenticeships and increasing on-the-job training. The goal is to equip Americans with the skills they need to succeed in an economy that is increasingly shifting towards technology and service industries.
