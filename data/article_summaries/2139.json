The bipartisan funding bill has been passed, showing that members of both parties can work together for the benefit of the American people. The bill aims to reduce costs for families and businesses, support economic recovery, and strengthen American leadership globally. It includes resources to provide significant support to Ukraine in their defense of their country and democracy, launch an ambitious initiative to make progress in curing diseases like cancer, and offer additional support to law enforcement for community protection. The bill also puts an end to a series of short-term continuing resolutions that have hindered the government's ability to address pressing challenges. The President is looking forward to signing the bill into law. However, there is still a need for Congress to urgently provide funds to prevent disruptions to the COVID response.
