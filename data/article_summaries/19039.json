The article discusses the President's proposal to reinstate the authority to reorganize the government and consolidate agencies. The President's first proposed use of this authority is to consolidate six agencies into one more efficient department focused on promoting competitiveness, exports, and American business. The goal is to make it easier for small businesses to interact with the government and eliminate redundancies and waste. The President's proposal includes creating a single Department where entrepreneurs can go for all their needs, from patents to exporting. Additionally, a new website called BusinessUSA will be launched to provide information for small businesses and those looking to export.
