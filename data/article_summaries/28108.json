According to a national survey by Rasmussen Reports, 65% of likely U.S. voters support President Trump's plan to improve America's infrastructure. The plan calls for generating $1.5 trillion in upgrades through partnerships with the federal government, state government, and private industry. The Oklahoma Editorial Board believes that Trump's regulatory reforms could benefit infrastructure development. Bloomberg View Editorial Board states that aspects of Trump's plan, such as giving states and cities incentives to spend more on public works and attracting private investment, are promising. Liz Peek, a contributor to The Hill, supports Trump's proposal to cut regulations in order to speed up the permitting process. Small businesses also support the idea of splitting costs between the public and private sectors, according to UBS Americas President Tom Naratil. The Reason Foundation's Robert Poole believes that the plan aims to target investments to infrastructure projects that deliver better value for money, while also expanding the use of public-private partnerships. R. Richard Geddes of the American Enterprise Institute suggests converting rest areas into revenue-producing assets by adding restaurants, shops, and amenities like electric-vehicle charging stations.
