President Biden is announcing his intent to nominate one new federal judicial nominee, bringing the total number of announced federal judicial nominees to 144. He has been committed to strengthening the federal bench and has already confirmed the most lower court judges for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration. Additionally, he plans to nominate three new U.S. Attorneys and three new U.S. Marshals who are devoted to enforcing the law and upholding the rule of law. The President has proposed a budget that includes increased funding for law enforcement to tackle the rising crime rate. He has also launched efforts to address gun crime by increasing police presence, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking. This announcement brings the total number of U.S. Attorney nominees to 63 and U.S. Marshal nominees to 20. One of the nominees, Scott Colom, has served as the District Attorney for the 16th Judicial District of Mississippi since 2016 and has previous experience in private practice and various legal roles.
