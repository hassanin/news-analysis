The White House Press Secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, provided updates on President Biden's agenda during a press briefing aboard Air Force One. She mentioned that the President will deliver remarks in Syracuse, New York, highlighting his vision for the economy and contrasting it with the plans of congressional Republicans. She also mentioned the President's upcoming schedule, including trips to Philadelphia, New York City, Fort Lauderdale, and New Mexico.

Jean-Pierre addressed questions about Ron Klain violating the Hatch Act, stating that Klain takes the Hatch Act seriously and fixed the mistake as soon as it was pointed out. She also discussed the relationship with China, stating that the US approach is one of competition and that the President and President Xi have had multiple conversations.

Regarding Russia, Jean-Pierre stated that Putin's recent speech does not indicate a change in his strategic goals, particularly regarding Ukraine. She also mentioned that any attack on US infrastructure will be met with a response.

Jean-Pierre commented on the recent increase in mortgage rates, stating that the economic recovery is powering forward and that the administration sees the Federal Reserve as independent.

When asked about the President's remarks on oil and gas company profits, Jean-Pierre stated that the President believes it is unacceptable for energy companies to raise gas prices quickly when oil prices go up but not bring them down when oil prices drop. The administration has been in contact with energy companies and will continue to call on them to treat consumers fairly.

Jean-Pierre also discussed the evaluation of the US-Saudi Arabia relationship, stating that the President has always been clear that it needs to be evaluated but in a bipartisan way. She mentioned the importance of Saudi Arabia's assistance to Ukraine and the administration's focus on issues that matter to the American people.
