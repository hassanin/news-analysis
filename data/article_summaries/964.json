In Presidential Determination No. 2023-09, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. certifies that the continuation of U.S. drug interdiction assistance to the Government of Colombia is necessary due to the significant threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to Colombia's national security. The determination also states that Colombia has appropriate procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of life during interdiction operations, including effective means to identify and warn aircraft before the use of force is employed. The Secretary of State is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register and notify Congress accordingly.
