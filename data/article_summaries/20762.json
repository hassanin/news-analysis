The article discusses the establishment of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center through an executive order. The purpose of this center is to strengthen and coordinate the enforcement of U.S. trade rights under international trade agreements and domestic trade laws. The center will be located within the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and will include participation from various government agencies such as the Department of State, Department of Treasury, Department of Justice, Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The center will be responsible for coordinating enforcement efforts, exchanging information related to potential trade violations, and conducting outreach to foster greater participation in reducing or eliminating trade barriers and unfair practices. The funding and administrative support for the center will be provided by USTR, subject to the availability of appropriations. The order also provides definitions for terms such as "U.S. trade rights" and "domestic trade laws" for clarification. The implementation of this order is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
