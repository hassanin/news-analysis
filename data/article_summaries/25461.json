The United States strongly condemns the ongoing violence in Nicaragua and human rights abuses committed by the Ortega regime. The regime has manipulated Nicaraguan law, suppressed civil society, opposition parties, and independent media, leading to protests calling for democratic reforms. The demands have been met with indiscriminate violence, resulting in over 350 deaths, thousands of injuries, and the imprisonment, torture, or disappearance of citizens labeled as "coup-mongers" or "terrorists." The United States supports the people of Nicaragua, including members of the Sandinista party, in their call for democratic reforms and an end to the violence. They believe that free, fair, and transparent elections are necessary for restoring democracy in Nicaragua. The Trump Administration has designated three Nicaraguan officials under the Global Magnitsky Act for human rights abuses and corruption. The United States is revoking or restricting visas of Nicaraguan officials and their families who are responsible for police violence, support pro-government parapolice violence, or prevent victims from receiving care. They have also secured the return of vehicles donated to the Nicaraguan National Police that were used to suppress peaceful protests and have cut off further sales and donations of equipment that could be misused by Ortega's security forces. The United States has provided an additional $1.5 million in aid to support freedom and democracy in Nicaragua. They are engaging with regional partners and have issued a declaration of support for the people of Nicaragua at the Organization of American States (OAS) General Assembly and passed a resolution in the OAS condemning the violence. Senior Administration officials have publicly demanded an end to the state-sanctioned violence and the United States will continue to monitor the situation closely and work with the international community to hold those responsible accountable.
