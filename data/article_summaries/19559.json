President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation recognizing the importance of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in providing equal access to higher education. The proclamation acknowledges the barriers African Americans faced in obtaining a college education prior to the Civil War and the significant contributions HBCUs have made to academia. It also highlights the role of HBCUs in helping the United States achieve its goal of having the highest proportion of college graduates by 2020. The proclamation emphasizes the need for resources and financial aid for these institutions, and the commitment of the Obama Administration to support HBCUs. It calls upon educators, public officials, organizations, and all Americans to observe National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week with appropriate programs and activities.
