In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced that President Biden is taking action to combat gun violence and violent crime in the United States. The administration is implementing a comprehensive strategy that targets the crime itself, implements preventative measures, and addresses root causes, including the flow of firearms used in crimes. The plan includes holding rogue firearm dealers accountable, supporting local law enforcement, investing in evidence-based community violence interventions, expanding summer programming and employment opportunities for teenagers and young adults, and assisting formerly incarcerated individuals in reentering their communities. Psaki also mentioned that Vice President Kamala Harris will hold a listening session with civil rights and voting rights groups following the Senate vote on the For the People Act. The President will travel to Raleigh, North Carolina to highlight the importance of getting vaccinated and kick off a community canvassing event. The press briefing also covered topics such as the Vice President's upcoming visit to the border, infrastructure negotiations, Iran, and Afghanistan. Psaki emphasized that the administration is committed to addressing these issues and will continue to take steps to make progress.
