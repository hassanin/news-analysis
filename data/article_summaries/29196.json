President Trump announced the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, stating that the agreement disadvantages the US and imposes economic burdens. He argued that the deal does not hold other countries accountable for their emissions and allows them to continue using coal. Trump emphasized his commitment to protecting American citizens and workers, and stated that the US will either renegotiate the terms of the agreement or negotiate a new deal that is fair to the US. He also emphasized his commitment to economic growth and job creation. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt expressed support for Trump's decision, stating that the US has already made significant reductions in carbon emissions and should focus on exporting technology and innovation to other countries.
