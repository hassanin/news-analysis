In this memorandum, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. states that he has determined there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. This allows for a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran through foreign financial institutions. The President will continue to monitor the situation closely, and the Secretary of State is directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
