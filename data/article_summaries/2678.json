The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework is a plan that aims to address economic disparities and the consequences of disinvestment in America's infrastructure, with a particular focus on communities of color. It includes critical investments to increase access to good-paying jobs, affordable high-speed internet, reliable public transit, clean drinking water, and other resources. The plan also emphasizes the need for additional investments in caregiving infrastructure, housing supply, regional development, and workforce development programs to ensure economic opportunity and justice for underserved communities.

One of the key goals of the framework is to deliver high-speed internet to every American household. Currently, there is a digital divide, with communities of color having less access to high-speed internet. The plan allocates $65 billion to make broadband available to all Americans, reduce prices, and close the digital divide. It also prioritizes expanding broadband on Tribal lands.

Another focus of the framework is eliminating lead pipes and delivering clean drinking water to every household. Many pipes and treatment plants across the country are aging, leading to polluted drinking water that endangers public health. Communities of color are at the highest risk for lead exposure, both at home and in schools. The plan includes the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history, aiming to replace all lead pipes and service lines and invest in water infrastructure across America.

The framework also aims to invest in more public transit options and address the backlog of repairs. Communities of color rely more on public transit for commuting, and the plan seeks to reduce commute times and create more economic opportunities in these communities. It allocates $48.5 billion to modernize transit, improve accessibility for older Americans and people with disabilities, and replace transit vehicles with clean, zero-emission vehicles.

To address the historical injustices caused by transportation infrastructure, the framework establishes a program to reconnect communities that have been divided by inequitable transportation infrastructure. This program will fund the planning, design, demolition, and reconstruction of street grids, parks, and other infrastructure.

Other initiatives included in the plan are electrifying school buses to improve air quality for children, remediating brownfield and Superfund sites, safeguarding communities of color from climate crises and extreme weather risks, and investing in a clean energy grid to mitigate the impacts of pollution on communities of color.

Overall, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework aims to address economic disparities and racial injustices by investing in critical infrastructure and providing communities of color with greater access to economic opportunities and resources.
