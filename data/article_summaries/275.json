The administration is committed to rapidly deploying 5G while minimizing disruptions to air operations. An agreement was reached last night that ensures no disruptions to air operations for the next two weeks and aims to reduce disruptions when AT&T and Verizon launch 5G on January 19th. The administration has been working with technical experts from the FAA, FCC, and wireless and aviation industries to find a solution for the safe coexistence of 5G and aviation. The efforts of Secretary Buttigieg, FAA Administrator Dickson, FCC Chair Rosenworcel, AT&T, Verizon, and airline industry leaders were appreciated in reaching this agreement.
