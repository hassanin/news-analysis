Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy called President Obama to inform him of Italy's decision to provide additional military support to Operation Unified Protector in Libya. This includes authorizing air-to-ground strikes on Libyan regime targets. President Obama expressed his appreciation for Italy's contributions to NATO-led coalition efforts to enforce United Nations Security Resolutions 1970 and 1973 and acknowledged Berlusconi's leadership on Libya. Both leaders agreed that more pressure is needed to strengthen the civilian protection mission, and Obama emphasized that the best way to ensure the safety of the Libyan people is for Qaddafi to step down. Italy will also host the next meeting of the Libya Contact Group on May 5 in Rome, where the international community will discuss increasing diplomatic and economic pressure on the Qaddafi regime and providing support to the Transitional National Council.
