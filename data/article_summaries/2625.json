President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed December 15, 2023, as Bill of Rights Day in the United States. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of the Bill of Rights and the fundamental rights and liberties it guarantees, such as freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and privacy. President Biden also acknowledges the need for constant vigilance to protect these rights, as recent events, such as the Supreme Court decision on abortion and the passing of laws that make it harder to vote, threaten these freedoms. He reiterates his commitment to defending these rights and urges Congress to take action to restore and expand access to voting and protect LGBTQI+ rights. President Biden calls on all Americans to unite in safeguarding these fundamental freedoms and making real the promise of dignity, equality, and opportunity for all.
