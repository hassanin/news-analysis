The article discusses the connection between corruption and conflict, using the example of Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation in Tunisia in 2010, which sparked the Arab Spring. It highlights how corruption is not just a low-level problem but can be systemic, with rulers and their cronies enriching themselves at the expense of the people. The article mentions other examples of regimes that have been toppled due to corruption, such as Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen. The United States is determined to bring attention to this issue and will convene the first-ever Security Council meeting focused on corruption and its consequences for conflict. Additionally, there will be a meeting dedicated to corruption in Venezuela, where Security Council members will hear about how the country's leaders have profited at the expense of their people.
