On January 24, 2014, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 3527, is called the "Poison Center Network Act" and reauthorizes funding for Poison Control Program activities at the Department of Health and Human Services until Fiscal Year 2019. This includes a grant program for Poison Control Centers, a nationwide toll-free number, and a national media campaign. The second bill, S. 230, authorizes the Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation to establish a commemorative work related to the Peace Corps in the District of Columbia and its surroundings.
