President Obama applauds the initiatives announced by Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta and General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to combat sexual assault in the military. He believes that the men and women in the military deserve an environment free from the threat of sexual assault, and that allegations of sexual assault should be thoroughly investigated, offenders held accountable, and victims provided with care and support. The President considers elevating these cases to a higher level of command review to be an important step and expresses his belief that sexual assault has no place in the military. He thanks Secretary Panetta and Chairman Dempsey and looks forward to continued progress on this issue.
