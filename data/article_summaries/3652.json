The White House hosted a virtual roundtable on domestic violence in the military to raise awareness during National Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. They discussed the impact of new reforms to the military justice system on survivors of domestic violence in the military. President Biden has prioritized military justice reform and signed an Executive Order in July to strengthen how the military handles serious offenses including sexual assault, domestic violence, and murder. The Executive Order transferred decision-making authorities from commanders to independent military prosecutors, who will have full prosecutorial discretion for covered offenses starting from December 27, 2023.
