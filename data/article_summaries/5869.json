President Biden has announced two new judicial nominees who are highly qualified and committed to upholding the rule of law and the Constitution. These nominations reflect the President's commitment to diversity in the courts, both in terms of personal and professional backgrounds.

Nancy Gbana Abudu, the nominee for the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, would be the first African-American woman judge to sit on the Eleventh Circuit and the second woman of color to do so. She would also be the third African-American judge on that court and the first person of color from Georgia to serve on the Eleventh Circuit. Abudu currently serves as the Deputy Legal Director and Director for Strategic Litigation at the Southern Poverty Law Center.

J. Michelle Childs, the nominee for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has been a federal judge on the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina since 2010. Prior to that, she served as a state court trial judge and a Commissioner on the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission. She has a diverse legal background, including experience as an associate and partner at a law firm.

These nominations mark President Biden's twelfth round of nominees for federal judicial positions, bringing the total number of announced nominees to 75. The President has been dedicated to strengthening the federal bench throughout his career and has made it a priority to swiftly fill judicial vacancies. In 2021 alone, 40 circuit and district court judges were confirmed, the highest number since Ronald Reagan's presidency. Notably, 80% of the confirmed judges are women, with 53% being people of color.

Overall, these nominations highlight President Biden's commitment to diversity and representation on the federal bench, ensuring that the courts reflect the rich diversity of the country's population.
