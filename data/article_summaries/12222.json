The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi, Kenya. The attack resulted in the loss of innocent lives and injuries to American citizens and embassy staff. The US extends its condolences to the affected families and commends the bravery of Kenyan security personnel and first responders. The US has offered its support to the Kenyan government in bringing the perpetrators to justice and will continue to stand with the Kenyan people in their fight against terrorism, including the threat posed by al-Shabaab. This act of cowardice will not weaken our determination.
