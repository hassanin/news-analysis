The Supreme Court's recent ruling has been criticized by President Obama, who believes it will lead to an increase in special interest money in politics. He views this as a victory for powerful entities such as big oil, Wall Street banks, and health insurance companies, who already have significant influence in Washington. The President is concerned that this ruling will further diminish the voices of everyday Americans who support their preferred candidates through small contributions. As a result, he plans to work with Congress to develop a strong response to this decision in order to protect the public interest.
