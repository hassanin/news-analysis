The United States has expressed deep concern over reports that the Sudanese Armed Forces attacked and burned the village of Khor Abeche in South Darfur. The attack resulted in injuries, deaths, and the displacement of thousands of people, according to the United Nations. The United States condemns this attack on civilians. The timing of this attack is troubling as there is also evidence of increased support to militant groups from the governments of Sudan and Southern Sudan. All Sudanese leaders have a responsibility to protect civilian populations, and failure to do so is unacceptable. As Sudanese leaders discuss their future relationship with the international community and the upcoming referendum on the status of Southern Sudan, they must acknowledge and fulfill this responsibility.
