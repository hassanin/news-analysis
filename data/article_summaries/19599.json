The White House condemns the assassination of Kurdish opposition leader Mishaal al-Tammo and the assault on opposition figure Riad Sayf in Syria. They reject violence against peaceful oppositionists and express solidarity with the people of Syria. The statement highlights that these acts reveal the hollowness of the Assad regime's promises for dialogue and reform. The attacks also occurred shortly after the UN Security Council failed to pass a resolution for international human rights monitors in Syria. The United States will continue to mobilize the international community to support the democratic aspirations of the Syrian people and apply pressure on the Assad regime.
