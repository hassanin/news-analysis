President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2018." However, he has expressed concerns about certain sections of the Act. Sections 101 and 201 are said to require the President to deny entry into the United States to certain individuals, without allowing for exceptions for the President's responsibility to receive ambassadors under the Constitution. Section 104 is said to direct negotiations with foreign governments or require the Executive to adopt a particular foreign policy. While the Trump Administration supports the diplomatic initiatives outlined in the Act, it will interpret these provisions in a manner consistent with the President's exclusive constitutional authorities in the area of foreign relations.
