This executive order, issued on December 11, 2019, addresses the rise of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incidents in the United States and around the world. The order states that discrimination against Jews may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it is based on an individual's race, color, or national origin. It directs all executive departments and agencies to enforce Title VI against anti-Semitism as vigorously as they do against other forms of discrimination. The order also instructs agencies to consider the non-legally binding working definition of anti-Semitism adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) and the IHRA's examples of contemporary anti-Semitism when identifying evidence of discrimination. Within 120 days, each agency charged with enforcing Title VI must submit a report to the President, identifying additional nondiscrimination authorities where the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism could be applicable. The order clarifies that it does not alter evidentiary requirements for determining actionable discrimination or infringe upon other rights protected by law. It also does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The order is to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
