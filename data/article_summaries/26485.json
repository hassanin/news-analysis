Vice President Mike Pence recently attended a ceremony in Hawaii where 55 boxes containing the remains of US service members from the Korean War were returned to American soil. This marks a new season of hope for the families of these fallen soldiers, as recovery efforts had been suspended for over a decade due to North Korea's nuclear threats. The return of the remains comes after President Trump's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, where he secured a promise from Kim to return the remains of fallen US service members. The President thanked Kim for honoring his word, and Vice President Pence pledged to continue striving until every hero lost in the Korean War is home.
