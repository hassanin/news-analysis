The Senate has taken a step forward in fulfilling the President's goal of strengthening supply chains, boosting domestic manufacturing, and outcompeting China. There is bipartisan support for investments in areas such as domestic manufacturing, innovation support, and addressing supply chain bottlenecks like semiconductors. Recent events, including the pandemic and aggression from Russia, highlight the importance of producing critical components in America for economic and national security. Progress has been made in rebuilding the industrial base and creating manufacturing jobs, along with investing in infrastructure. The Bipartisan Innovation Act aims to build on these successes, creating more jobs, promoting domestic production, and reducing prices for working families.
