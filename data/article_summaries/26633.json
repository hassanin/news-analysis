President Donald J. Trump has implemented an initiative to address the opioid crisis by targeting the driving forces behind it. The initiative focuses on reducing demand and over-prescription by educating Americans about the dangers of opioid misuse and curbing over-prescription. It also aims to cut off the supply of illicit drugs by cracking down on international and domestic drug supply chains. Additionally, the initiative provides support for those struggling with addiction through evidence-based treatment and recovery services. President Trump has worked with Congress to pass the SUPPORT Act, which is the largest legislative package in history aimed at combating a single drug crisis.
