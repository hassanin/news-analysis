President Barack Obama has proclaimed January 2012 as National Stalking Awareness Month in the United States. Stalking is a serious crime that affects millions of men and women each year, causing emotional and physical distress. Stalkers use intimidation, threats, and nonconsensual communication to instill fear in their victims. Many victims suffer from anxiety, anger, helplessness, and depression. Stalking can also lead to more violent offenses such as sexual assault and homicide. Despite the dangers of stalking, public awareness and legal responses to this crime are limited. Data shows that one in six women and one in 19 men have experienced stalking that caused them to fear for their safety. Most victims are stalked by current or former intimate partners, and young adults are at the highest risk. However, many victims do not report the crime due to shame, fear of retribution, or lack of support. The Obama Administration is working to protect stalking victims, empower survivors, and end violence against women and men. Efforts include promoting public awareness, supporting survivors, and holding perpetrators accountable. The proclamation urges all Americans to recognize the signs of stalking, acknowledge it as a serious crime, and support victims.
