President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order called "Blocking Property of the Government of Venezuela." This order blocks all property and interests in property of the Venezuelan government within the jurisdiction of the United States. It also allows the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to impose sanctions on individuals who support Nicolas Maduro and his regime. The Executive Order specifically targets those who undermine the democratically elected National Assembly of Venezuela or Interim President Juan Guaido. The United States condemns the Maduro dictatorship for its human rights abuses and repression, and stands with the people of Venezuela in their fight for freedom, basic rights, and a return to democracy. The Trump Administration has made it clear that all options are on the table and the United States will use every appropriate tool to end Maduro's hold on Venezuela, support humanitarian assistance, and ensure a democratic transition. The United States will continue to work with its partners to safeguard peace and security in the Western Hemisphere.
