On August 17, 2001, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13222, declaring a national emergency regarding the threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States due to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979. As the Act has not been renewed by Congress, the national emergency declared in 2001 must continue beyond August 17, 2012. President Obama, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, has decided to continue the national emergency for another year. This decision will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
