This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Myra M. Shird has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments.
