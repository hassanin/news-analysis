The United States is facing an outbreak of monkeypox, a virus that is less transmissible than COVID-19 but requires a comprehensive response from federal, state, local, and international governments and communities. President Biden has taken actions to make vaccines, testing, and treatments available as part of the monkeypox outbreak response. The Biden-Harris Administration announced the first phase of its national monkeypox vaccine strategy, which aims to rapidly deploy vaccines in the most affected communities. The strategy includes allocating 296,000 doses of the vaccine over the coming weeks, with an additional 1.6 million doses becoming available in the coming months. The administration is also working to make testing more widely available and easier to access, with CDC shipping tests to commercial laboratory companies to increase testing capacity. Community engagement is a key aspect of the response, with efforts to communicate with healthcare providers, public health officials, and affected communities and to provide information on testing, treatments, and vaccines. The administration is also leading global efforts to combat monkeypox and is developing research and evidence priorities to improve medical countermeasures and enhance understanding of the virus. The response will continue to adapt as more is learned about the virus and the situation develops.
