The Supreme Court's decision in 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis is seen as a setback for LGBTQI+ rights and raises concerns about potential discrimination. The decision specifically pertains to expressive original designs, but many worry that it could lead to more discrimination against LGBTQI+ individuals. This ruling also weakens laws that protect all Americans from discrimination in public accommodations, including people of color, people with disabilities, people of faith, and women. The administration is committed to enforcing federal laws that protect against discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation, and will work with states to fight against any attempts to roll back civil rights protections. The goal is to achieve full equality for every American, and passing the Equality Act is seen as crucial in enshrining civil rights protections for LGBTQI+ individuals in federal law. The president urges Congress to swiftly pass this legislation.
