The Biden-Harris Administration is taking historic actions to create jobs, lower costs, and invest in energy communities that have powered the nation for years. This agenda aims to bring back manufacturing jobs, rebuild the economy from the bottom-up, and ensure that no community is left behind. The actions announced today will drive new investments in energy communities, strengthen American supply chains, and help coal, oil, and gas workers benefit from the clean energy economy. This builds on the over $14 billion in federal investments that have already been made in energy communities, as well as the $7.4 billion in private sector investments. The Energy Communities Interagency Working Group (IWG) has released a new report to mark two years of partnership with energy communities and the Administration's commitment to building a clean energy future. The IWG has driven over $14.1 billion in federal investments, including funds from the American Rescue Plan for economic development and abandoned mine land reclamation. Additionally, they have identified over $500 billion in funding opportunities for energy communities.
