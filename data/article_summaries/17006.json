President Barack Obama has proclaimed October 2013 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of diversity and the contributions that people with disabilities make to communities and businesses. While progress has been made in removing barriers for individuals with disabilities, only 20 percent of Americans with disabilities currently participate in the labor force. The Obama Administration is committed to increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities, including veterans. Efforts have been made to improve recruitment, hiring, and retention of individuals with disabilities in Federal agencies and contractors. The Affordable Care Act also provides new options for states to support home and community-based services. The President pledges to continue working towards effective implementation of the Rehabilitation Act and urges all Americans to embrace the talents and skills of individuals with disabilities and promote equal employment opportunities for all.
