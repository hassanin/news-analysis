On May 20, 2014, the President signed into law H.R. 3627, also known as the "Kilah Davenport Child Protection Act of 2013." This law increases penalties for individuals who commit domestic assault and have at least two previous convictions for assault, sexual abuse, or serious violent felony against their child or a child in their care. Additionally, it requires the Justice Department to report on the penalties for violations of State laws prohibiting child abuse.
