The article discusses the need for flexibility and focus in education law in order to support the reforms and innovations happening in states and school districts. Many states have adopted college- and career-ready standards, developed high-quality assessments, and implemented accountability and support systems. However, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) has unintentionally become a barrier to these reforms. The article introduces ESEA flexibility, which focuses on supporting state and local reform efforts in three critical areas: transitioning to college- and career-ready standards and assessments, developing systems of differentiated recognition, accountability, and support, and evaluating teacher and principal effectiveness. States can request flexibility through waivers of specific NCLB provisions. This includes flexibility regarding the 2013-2014 timeline for achieving 100 percent proficiency, district and school improvement and accountability requirements, and the use of federal education funds. To receive flexibility, a state must develop a comprehensive plan addressing these critical areas. This includes adopting college- and career-ready standards, implementing statewide tests aligned with these standards, establishing a differentiated recognition, accountability, and support system, and setting guidelines for teacher and principal evaluation and support systems.
