During a meeting between NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and President Joe Biden, they discussed the importance of the transatlantic bond and the need to address various issues. These issues include Russia, with Allied leaders seeking consultation ahead of the meeting with President Putin, and China, as there is a recognition among Allies of China's investments in military capabilities, coercive behavior, and growing influence. They also reviewed the NATO 2030 agenda, which requires increased defense spending. President Biden emphasized the importance of NATO for America's interests and praised Stoltenberg's leadership. He also reaffirmed the United States' commitment to Article 5, stating that NATO stepped up when America was attacked and that the United States will continue to be there for Europe.
