The article discusses the need for investment in infrastructure in the United States and the potential positive impact it can have on the economy. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that a 10-year, $1.5 trillion infrastructure investment initiative could add between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage point to average annual real GDP growth. To achieve this growth, the article suggests four key actions: streamlining and improving the regulatory structure, securing additional resources for infrastructure investment through user charges or taxes, supporting innovative financing options such as public-private partnerships, and improving project selection and investment allocations. By implementing these actions, the article argues that the United States can experience a productive and prosperous 21st century.
