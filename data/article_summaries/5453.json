This article highlights the importance of staying safe on the water during National Safe Boating Week. It celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971, which improved the safety of recreational boating. The Coast Guard estimates that these efforts have saved nearly 100,000 lives over the last 50 years. Despite this, there have still been over 13,000 boating-related deaths and over 64,000 boating-related injuries since 2000. The article emphasizes the need for education and planning, as human error contributes to most boating accidents. It encourages taking boating safety courses, ensuring boats are ready for the water through vessel safety checks, and following basic safety procedures such as wearing life jackets, carrying emergency distress equipment, using the engine cut-off switch, and staying sober while boating. The President of the United States has proclaimed May 22-28, 2021, as National Safe Boating Week, encouraging all Americans who participate in boating activities to observe this occasion by practicing safe boating behaviors.
