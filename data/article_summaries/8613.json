The U.S. Government has made progress in implementing the Collaborative Migration Management Strategy, which aims to manage migration in North and Central America. The strategy, launched on July 29, 2021, focuses on addressing humanitarian needs, promoting access to protection and legal pathways for migration, improving border management, and supporting the reintegration of returnees. Achieving these objectives requires cooperation with various stakeholders, including Congress, civil society, international organizations, the private sector, labor unions, and governments within and outside the region. The strategy also emphasizes stabilizing populations with acute needs, expanding access to international protection, expanding access to protection in countries of origin, improving worker protections in third country labor migration programs, fostering secure and humane border management, strengthening regional public messaging on migration, and expanding access to lawful pathways for protection and opportunity in the United States.
