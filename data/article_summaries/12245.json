President Barack Obama will be giving a major speech on the economy at Georgetown University on April 14th. The speech will address the steps his administration has taken to confront the economic crisis and how they fit into his broader vision for the economy. He will also discuss the work that still needs to be done to move the economy forward. The event will be open to correspondents, but space is limited.
