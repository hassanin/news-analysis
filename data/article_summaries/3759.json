In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. emphasizes the importance of mental health and the need to address the mental health crisis, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. He acknowledges that millions of Americans, including adults and children, experience mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. He highlights the discrimination and barriers that people with mental health conditions face in accessing treatment and support. The pandemic has further exacerbated mental health issues due to isolation, sickness, grief, job loss, food instability, and disrupted routines. The prevalence of mental health conditions was already on the rise before the pandemic, with increasing rates of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults and severe depression among youth. Suicide rates are also a concern, especially among Black youth and LGBTQI+ individuals. President Biden commits to advancing suicide prevention efforts and improving crisis response. He emphasizes the need for compassion, respect, and understanding in treating individuals with mental health conditions. Addressing disparities, particularly in underserved communities and communities of color, is also a priority. The American Rescue Plan includes investments in mental health promotion and support for the healthcare workforce. The plan also aims to integrate mental health and addiction treatment into primary care settings, schools, and homes. President Biden calls for an expansion of the mental health workforce, including school-based professionals, and provides funding for substance use and mental health care block grants. Additionally, funding is allocated to support Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics to enhance access to evidence-based services. The President emphasizes the importance of letting people know that they are not alone and that help is available to support their mental health. He proclaims May 2021 as National Mental Health Awareness Month and calls upon various stakeholders to raise awareness and prioritize mental health.
