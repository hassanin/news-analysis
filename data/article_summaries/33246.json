President Donald J. Trump has signed Executive Grants of Clemency (Full Pardons) for five individuals: John Richard Bubala, Roy Wayne McKeever, Rodney Takumi, Michael Tedesco, and Chalmer Lee Williams. These individuals had previous convictions for various offenses, but have since demonstrated good behavior and involvement in charitable works. The pardons restore their federal rights, including the right to vote and bear arms.
