The article states that on June 16, 2006, President Barack Obama declared a national emergency in response to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other individuals who were undermining Belarus's democratic processes and institutions. This included undemocratic elections, human rights abuses, and public corruption. The national emergency and the measures taken to address it were set to expire on June 16, 2014. However, due to the ongoing threat posed by these individuals, President Obama has decided to continue the national emergency for another year. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be transmitted to Congress.
