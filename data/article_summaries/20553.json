Former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds has passed away, and Vice President Joe Biden has issued a statement expressing his sadness and paying tribute to Reynolds' instrumental role in the 1993 Downing Street Declaration. The declaration, made with former British Prime Minister John Major, paved the way for major peace agreements in Ireland and Northern Ireland over the past two decades. Biden urges current leaders to continue advancing the peace process in Northern Ireland, so that all citizens can live in the peaceful and prosperous community that Reynolds envisioned. He sends his condolences to Reynolds' family and friends.
