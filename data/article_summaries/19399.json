In a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest provided updates on President Obama's ongoing efforts to combat ISIL. Earnest stated that the President received an update from General Austin and other senior CENTCOM officials on their efforts to develop plans for a sustained military campaign against ISIL and to build a broad international coalition. The President was pleased with the briefing and called it "thorough." Earnest also mentioned that the President will convene his national security team to prepare for next week's UN Security Council meeting to discuss the threat posed by foreign fighters. In response to questions about the capability of the Iraqi security forces, Earnest noted that the failure of the Iraqi security forces to withstand ISIL's assault earlier this summer was due to the failed political leadership of Iraq's central government. He mentioned that the core component of the strategy is the formation of an inclusive central government in Baghdad, which has made progress in unifying the security forces. Earnest also addressed concerns about the need for an immunity agreement and the risk of a slippery slope to more US involvement. He emphasized that the President has ruled out a combat role for US troops and that the strategy focuses on supporting Iraqi and Kurdish security forces and Syrian opposition fighters. Earnest dismissed comments made by former Defense Secretary Gates, stating that the President's strategy ensures that American national security interests are front and center. He also mentioned that the President has been pleased with the advice he has received from his military planners and that the ongoing planning effort includes building an international coalition. Earnest concluded by mentioning that President Poroshenko of Ukraine will be visiting the White House and that the President will continue to support Ukraine in its efforts to strengthen its democracy and economy.
