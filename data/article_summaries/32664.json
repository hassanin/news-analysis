In a historic move, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel have agreed to fully normalize their diplomatic relations. This peace agreement, known as the "Abraham Accord," is the first of its kind between Israel and an Arab country in more than 25 years. The agreement will lead to the exchange of embassies and ambassadors, as well as cooperation in various areas such as tourism, education, healthcare, trade, and security. The normalization of relations between the two countries is seen as a significant step towards a more peaceful and prosperous Middle East. The agreement also opens up greater access for Muslims to visit historic sites in Israel and peacefully pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The Trump administration played a key role in brokering this deal, which is expected to pave the way for more Arab and Muslim countries to follow suit and establish diplomatic ties with Israel.
