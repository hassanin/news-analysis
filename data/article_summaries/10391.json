The President met with business leaders to discuss the importance of immigration reform. They discussed the need to strengthen border security, create a path to citizenship, hold employers accountable, and streamline the legal immigration process. The business leaders expressed their support for these principles, including a pathway to citizenship that requires illegal immigrants to pay back taxes, a fine, and get in line behind those already going through the legal process. They also emphasized the importance of increasing border security and ensuring all employers follow the same rules. The President supports the progress made by Senators on this issue but is also prepared to introduce his own bill if necessary. The meeting included various business leaders and key members of the President's team.
