President Obama will be traveling to Cincinnati, Ohio, on September 22 to deliver remarks at the Brent Spence Bridge. He will be urging Congress to pass the American Jobs Act in order to make infrastructure investments and create more job opportunities for Americans. The Brent Spence Bridge is a crucial route for trucking in North America but is currently in need of major repairs, making it "functionally obsolete." If the American Jobs Act is passed, it will help address these repair needs and put more Americans back to work.
