President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of New York due to severe storms and flooding that occurred between June 28 and July 4, 2013. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The counties of Allegany, Chenango, Cortland, Delaware, Franklin, Herkimer, Madison, Montgomery, Niagara, Oneida, Otsego, and Warren are eligible for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Regis Leo Phelan has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional assessments are still underway, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated in the future.
