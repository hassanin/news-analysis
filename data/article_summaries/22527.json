In this Op-ed, Dr. Jill Biden and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti discuss the importance of making higher education more affordable and accessible for all students. They highlight the fact that 65 percent of all job openings by the end of the decade will require education or skills-training beyond high school. They argue that rising tuition costs are preventing many students from accessing higher education and that community colleges are uniquely positioned to address this issue. They mention President Obama's America's College Promise initiative, which aims to make community college free for responsible students. They believe that this is a smart investment and point out that over 36 free community college programs have already been launched across the country. They also highlight the Los Angeles College Promise program, which makes Los Angeles the largest city in the country to offer free community college to responsible students. They encourage other communities to follow suit and mention the release of the America's College Promise Playbook by the U.S. Department of Education, which provides guidance for designing effective free community college programs. They conclude by emphasizing the importance of education in unlocking opportunities and competitiveness in the global economy, and call for more leaders and communities to make higher education accessible to every willing student.
