The President spoke in the Roosevelt Room, addressing the urgent need for the American Rescue Plan. He highlighted that the economy still has 9.5 million fewer jobs compared to last year and stated that it would take two years to recover at the current rate. He emphasized the loss of 1 million educators and 400,000 small businesses, which are causing economic strain on state and local budgets. The President acknowledged that some job growth last month was a result of the December relief package, but without further aid, these gains will slow down. He stressed the importance of beating the virus, providing essential relief, and building an inclusive recovery. The President also mentioned the imminent expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits for 11 million people, the lack of food for 7 million children, and the 13 million people behind on rent. He concluded by stating that the rescue plan is crucial for getting kids back to school safely, supporting small businesses, and gaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic.
