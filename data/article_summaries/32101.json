President Donald J. Trump has signed legislation to halt the "Stream Protection Rule," which has been detrimental to coal workers and their communities. The coal industry has been in decline since 2009, leaving workers and communities without support. President Trump has fulfilled his promise to support coal workers and reverse the actions of the previous administration. He is committed to reducing regulatory burdens on Americans and businesses.
