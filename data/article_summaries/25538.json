This presidential memorandum, issued on May 8, 2018, outlines the decision to cease United States participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and take additional action to counter Iran's influence and prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The memorandum states that Iran has been a leading state sponsor of terrorism and has engaged in destabilizing activities in the region. The previous administration attempted to address Iran's pursuit of nuclear capabilities through the JCPOA, but Iran's behavior has escalated since then. The memorandum declares that providing sanctions relief to Iran is not in the national interest of the United States and announces the re-imposition of sanctions lifted or waived in connection with the JCPOA. The memorandum also emphasizes the policy of denying Iran a nuclear weapon and intercontinental ballistic missiles, neutralizing their campaign of regional aggression, and countering their development of weapons capabilities. It calls for the preparation to meet possible Iranian aggression and the monitoring of Iran's nuclear conduct. The memorandum concludes with general provisions.
