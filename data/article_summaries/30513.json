On August 30, 2019, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to establish the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee (Committee). The Committee is tasked with ensuring continued American leadership in quantum information science and technology applications. It consists of the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy or their designee, as well as up to 22 members appointed by the Secretary of Energy. Committee members must be qualified to provide advice and information on quantum information science and technology research, development, demonstrations, standards, education, technology transfers, commercial application, and national security economic concerns. The Committee will advise the Secretary and the Subcommittee on Quantum Information Science of the National Science and Technology Council, and make recommendations for the review and revision of the National Quantum Initiative Program. It will also engage with stakeholders from various sectors to gather information and ideas on quantum information science. The heads of agencies are required to provide information to the Committee upon request, and the Committee may create subcommittees and technical advisory groups. The Department of Energy will provide funding and support, and Committee members will serve without compensation but may receive travel expenses. The executive order is subject to applicable law and appropriations.
