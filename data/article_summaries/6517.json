The article discusses remarks made by Lael Brainard, the National Economic Council Director, on the state of the US economy and inflation. Brainard highlights that inflation has fallen for 12 consecutive months to 3%, the lowest it has been in over 2 years. This decline in inflation is attributed to a stabilizing economy, with real earnings for Americans increasing and a robust job market. Brainard credits Bidenomics and the Inflation Reduction Act for this positive economic performance, pointing to private-sector investments and infrastructure projects as evidence of their impact. Other news outlets also report on the defying expectations of the US economy and the improving odds of a "soft landing." The article also mentions that inflation in the US is now the lowest among the Group of 7 countries, while the recovery from the pandemic has been the strongest. Brainard dismisses predictions of a US recession and emphasizes the moderate inflation and resilient job market.
