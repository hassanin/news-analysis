Chris Smolenak, a former employee of a large corporation, has opened a storefront in Holland, PA, where customers can create their own handcrafted wooden signs and decorative items. Smolenak was motivated to start her own business due to the booming economy under President Trump. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December allows small businesses to deduct 20 percent off their business income and lower their taxable income. Many small businesses have used their tax savings to invest in new equipment, raise wages, provide bonuses and benefits, and create more jobs. The unemployment rate is at a healthy 3.9 percent, with more job openings than unemployed individuals. The unemployment rate for Hispanics and African Americans is at record lows, and workers' pay is improving. With more money in their pockets, Americans are spending again, benefiting small businesses.
