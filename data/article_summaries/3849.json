In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recognizes the importance of minority-owned businesses in communities across the United States. He highlights that over 9.2 million minority business enterprises support jobs and contribute over $1.8 trillion to the economy annually. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, minority-owned businesses have shown resilience by adapting to changes and keeping their operations running. However, these businesses have been disproportionately affected, with many facing revenue losses and some forced to shut down. The Biden Administration is committed to supporting minority entrepreneurs and businesses, as evidenced by initiatives such as advancing equity in federal procurement and revamping the Paycheck Protection Program to provide greater access to minority-owned businesses. President Biden also announced a goal to increase the share of contracts awarded to small disadvantaged businesses by 50% over the next five years. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will further support minority-owned businesses by expanding the authority and stature of the Minority Business Development Agency. During Minority Enterprise Development Week, the achievements and contributions of minority business entrepreneurs and enterprises are acknowledged and celebrated, with a commitment to promoting systemic economic equality.
