The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a trade agreement between the United States and eleven other countries that aims to boost Made in America exports, support higher-paying American jobs, and protect American workers. The agreement eliminates over 18,000 taxes (tariffs) that various countries impose on American exports, allowing American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and small businesses to compete in fast-growing markets. TPP also includes the strongest labor and environmental protections of any trade agreement in history, ensuring that all countries meet core labor standards and combat issues such as child labor and forced labor. The agreement promotes the growth of small businesses by addressing trade barriers that disproportionately affect them. It also includes provisions to promote e-commerce, protect digital freedom, and preserve an open internet. TPP disciplines state-owned enterprises to prevent unfair competition, prioritizes good governance and fighting corruption, and includes a development chapter dedicated to promoting sustainable development and reducing poverty. Finally, TPP lifts restrictions on access for American businesses in the services industry, unlocking new economic opportunities.
