The White House Office of the Press Secretary has announced new commitments from businesses and community leaders to promote financial literacy and capability for all Americans. The Administration has also unveiled a resource guide to help schools, colleges, employers, and community leaders create their own financial capability initiatives. The article highlights the importance of empowering Americans with financial literacy and information to protect them from personal and economic harm. The commitments include providing financial services to survivors of domestic violence, developing financial education and mentoring programs for older workers, donating subscriptions to a financial guidance technology start-up, launching regional financial inclusion and education programs, and implementing financial literacy frameworks in public schools. The commitments aim to help vulnerable populations, such as low-income households, Latinos, African-Americans, and young adults, gain access to information and tools to make responsible financial decisions.
