On March 23, 2020, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, S. 893, known as the "Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2020," requires the President to develop a strategy to ensure the security of next-generation mobile telecommunications systems and infrastructure in the United States. Additionally, it mandates that the President assist allies and strategic partners in maximizing the security of their own next-generation mobile telecommunications systems and infrastructure.

The second bill, S. 1822, known as the "Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability Act" or the "Broadband DATA Act," requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue rules regarding the collection of data on the availability of broadband services. This legislation aims to improve the accuracy of data on broadband availability and ensure that accurate information is used for decision-making and policy formulation.
