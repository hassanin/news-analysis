President Obama is urging Congress to act on his "To Do List" for small businesses, which includes investing in small businesses and promoting new hiring and entrepreneurship. He is specifically highlighting the need for legislation that gives a 10 percent income tax credit for firms that create new jobs or increase wages in 2012, as well as extending 100 percent expensing for all businesses. The President met with Congressional leadership to emphasize the importance of his economic agenda. The National Economic Council released a report on the investments made by the Obama Administration to support small businesses and called on Congress to make it easier for them to grow and create jobs. Cabinet members and Senior Administration officials will be participating in National Small Business Week events to speak about the President's efforts to help small businesses. The President's plan for congressional action includes a Small Business Jobs and Wages Tax Credit, which would provide firms with a 10 percent income tax credit for new wages added in 2012. It is focused on middle-class workers and helps around 2 million small businesses. The plan also proposes extending 100 percent expensing for 2012 to support business investment. The President's plan differs from the House Republican proposal, which provides across-the-board tax cuts to anyone with self-employment income, including companies that lay off workers or reduce pay.
