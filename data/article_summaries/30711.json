In a press briefing, Marc Short, the White House Director of Legislative Affairs, discussed the omnibus legislation that will fund the government through September 2017. The legislation includes $21 billion in additional funding for the military, $1.5 billion for border security, and funding to continue school choice in Washington, D.C. The legislation does not include cost-sharing reductions (CSR) or funding for insurance companies under Obamacare. Short also mentioned that the funding for the border security will go towards additional technology, fencing, border barriers, detention beds, and roads and maintenance. He stated that the legislation is a first step towards the construction of a border wall, and that the administration will continue to make the case for the wall in future budget requests. Short explained that the Democrats had asked for funding to prop up Obamacare, but the administration does not believe in bailing out the program and is hopeful that the repeal and replace of Obamacare will create a better market with lower rates. He mentioned that the budget reconciliation process only requires 50 votes, but the appropriations bill requires 60 votes to pass. Short acknowledged that some conservatives may be disappointed with the budget, but stated that the administration will continue to fight for spending cuts in the future. On the topic of Planned Parenthood, Short said that the President remains committed to pro-life policies and the defunding of Planned Parenthood is part of the Obamacare repeal and replace effort. He mentioned that the appropriations bill was not the place to defund Planned Parenthood and that the administration has tried to address it in the healthcare legislation. The legislation does maintain Hyde Amendment protections on life and ensures that taxpayer funds are not used for abortions.
