During a press briefing, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs discussed the tax plan and the reaction from Democrats. He acknowledged that there are parts of the plan that Democrats don't like, such as the upper-income tax rate changes and changes to the estate tax. However, he emphasized that the plan is a compromise and that it is important to prevent taxes from going up and to provide incentives for job creation and economic growth. Gibbs also addressed concerns about the reaction in bond markets and the increase in mortgage rates as a result of the deal. He stated that he would defer to the Treasury Department for more information on that topic. Gibbs also mentioned the budget deficit and the need to have a discussion about getting the fiscal house in order. He discussed the ongoing negotiations with the fiscal commission and the plans to put together a budget that addresses deficit reduction. Gibbs also addressed questions about the President's smoking habits and stated that he has not seen any evidence of smoking in the past nine months. He mentioned that the President has been working hard to quit smoking and that it is a struggle. The briefing also touched on topics such as the estate tax, bond markets, deficit reduction, and the situation in North Korea.
