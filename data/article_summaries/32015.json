President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation on December 28, 2020, commemorating the 850th anniversary of the martyrdom of Saint Thomas Becket. The proclamation highlights Becket's role as a champion of religious liberty and his defiance of the King's attempts to encroach upon the affairs of the Church. Becket's stand for religious freedom eventually led to constitutional limitations on state power over the Church and the establishment of religious liberty in the New World. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of religious freedom as a fundamental right and calls for an end to religious persecution worldwide. It also reaffirms the commitment of the United States to promote and defend religious freedom as a core dimension of its foreign policy. The proclamation concludes by inviting the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in commemoration of Thomas Becket's life and legacy.
