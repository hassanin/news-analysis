The article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Donald Trump on February 7, 2019, titled "Promoting Women's Global Development and Prosperity." The memorandum highlights the policy of the United States to enhance opportunities for women to participate in economic activities and benefit from them. The memorandum establishes the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, with the aim of reaching 50 million women in the developing world by 2025. The initiative focuses on three pillars: Women Prospering in the Workforce, Women Succeeding as Entrepreneurs, and Women Enabled in the Economy. A Working Group is established to support the objectives of the memorandum and coordinate efforts among relevant agencies. Agencies are also directed to prioritize and increase support for women's economic empowerment programs and allocate at least $300 million per fiscal year towards these programs. The memorandum also encourages collaboration with bilateral and multilateral institutions, NGOs, and private-sector partners to advance women's economic empowerment. Agencies are required to report on their progress towards the memorandum's goals on a yearly basis.
