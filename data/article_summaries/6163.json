The Biden-Harris Administration has announced progress on implementing its Housing Supply Action Plan, which aims to close the housing supply shortfall in five years. The plan focuses on boosting the supply of affordable housing to ease rising housing costs for renters and aspiring homeowners. The Administration is urging Congress to support the construction and preservation of affordable housing, expand rental assistance, assist aspiring homeowners with down payment assistance, and promote a more equitable housing market. The Administration is also urging state and local governments to reduce barriers to housing production, such as restrictive zoning and land use regulations. Federal agencies have taken action to reduce barriers to affordable housing construction and preservation, including finalizing the LIHTC income averaging rule, extending deadlines for LIHTC projects, and reforming Forward Commitment programs. The Administration is also enabling affordable housing development and preservation through the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds under the American Rescue Plan. Additionally, the Administration is promoting transit-oriented development, coordinating transportation and housing planning, and rewarding jurisdictions that have reformed zoning and land-use policies. The Administration is supporting housing innovation and alternative housing types, preserving the availability of affordable single-family homes for owner-occupants, and convening experts to discuss the growing trend of institutional investor purchases in the housing market.
