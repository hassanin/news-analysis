President Donald J. Trump is raising awareness about the opioid epidemic in the United States by bringing the "Prescribed to Death" opioids memorial to Washington, D.C. The memorial consists of the engravings of 22,000 people who died in 2015 from prescription opioid addiction. The President declared the opioid epidemic a Nationwide Public Health Emergency in October 2017 and has since taken steps to combat the crisis. These include reducing opioid prescriptions by one-third over the next three years and stiffening criminal penalties for those involved in dealing and trafficking illicit drugs. The memorial aims to highlight the severity of the crisis and encourage conversations between patients and healthcare providers about the safe use and disposal of opioids.
