In this article, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer discusses the tough choices that American families have to make during tough economic times. He emphasizes the need to be honest about what programs are working and what aren't, and making tough choices about which programs to fund and which to reduce or terminate. Pfeiffer highlights the efforts made by the Obama administration to cut programs that weren't working well or duplicated efforts, resulting in significant savings. He mentions the consolidation of education programs, cutting of grant programs at the National Park Service, elimination of the Advanced Earned Income Tax Credit, termination of the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative, and ending of Abandoned Mine Lands Payments to Certified States as examples of programs that have been reduced or terminated. Pfeiffer acknowledges that these choices are difficult, but necessary given the tough economic times and rising deficits.
