On July 30, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring the continuation of a national emergency with respect to Lebanon. This national emergency was initially declared on August 1, 2007, in response to actions by certain individuals undermining Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government, contributing to the breakdown of the rule of law, and infringing upon Lebanese sovereignty. The ongoing activities, such as Iran's arms transfers to Hezbollah, which include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems, continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2007 and the measures adopted at that time must remain in effect beyond August 1, 2019. The notice of this continuation will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
