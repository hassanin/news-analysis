The Biden-Harris Administration has introduced the Roadmap to Support Good Jobs, a whole-of-government effort aimed at creating good-paying, family-sustaining jobs and ensuring equitable access to training and education for all Americans. The Administration plans to strengthen and expand the workforce by partnering with employers, focusing on sectors such as manufacturing, construction, clean energy, healthcare, and information technology. The roadmap prioritizes four areas: connecting people to good jobs, preparing workers for transformational investments, meeting communities' labor needs, and boosting job quality. The Administration has already taken steps in these areas, including expanding job training opportunities, investing in sectors vital to economic security, and promoting education-to-workforce connections. The goal is to create a diverse, skilled workforce and promote job quality through measures such as expanding apprenticeships, enhancing workers' rights, and ensuring compliance with worker protection laws.
