The retail sales in September continued to rise, following a higher-than-expected increase in August. Compared to the same time last year, sales have increased by 14 percent, indicating a return to normalcy in the economy. Various sectors, including department stores, bookstores, furniture stores, and other retailers, saw significant growth in sales. Additionally, restaurants and bars experienced a 30 percent increase compared to last year and are 9 percent above pre-pandemic levels. This positive progress aligns with the news that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment has dropped below 300,000 for the first time since the pandemic began. This represents a decrease of over 60 percent since the current administration took office and is the lowest weekly figure since March 14, 2020. The decline in COVID-19 cases and unemployment can be attributed to vaccination requirements, which have helped reduce the number of eligible unvaccinated Americans from nearly 100 million in July to 66 million now. To ensure long-term prosperity, it is crucial to take action now by passing both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Build Back Better Act, which align with the desires of the majority of the American people.
