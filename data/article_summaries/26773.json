The article discusses the Administration's support for the substitute amendment to H.R. 10, also known as the Financial CHOICE Act. The Administration's goal is to reform the financial system by preventing taxpayer-funded bailouts, fostering economic growth, making regulation efficient and effective, and restoring public accountability within federal financial regulatory agencies. The amendment aims to eliminate taxpayer bailouts, simplify regulation, hold financial regulators accountable, and foster economic growth. It includes provisions such as allowing well-capitalized banking organizations to opt out of certain regulatory requirements, giving the President the authority to remove the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) at will, subjecting the CFPB to the congressional appropriations process, requiring broader use of cost-benefit analysis by financial regulators, and providing regulatory relief for community financial institutions. The Administration supports these provisions and hopes to work with Congress to undo additional mandates from the Dodd-Frank law that raise costs and limit choices for consumers. The Administration also thanks Chairman Jeb Hensarling for his leadership on the Financial CHOICE Act and supports its passage as an important step in financial reform legislation. They look forward to working with the Senate on finalizing the legislation.
