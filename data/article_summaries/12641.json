In a call between President Obama and Speaker Boehner, the President emphasized that the only viable option is for the House to pass the bipartisan Senate compromise that has the support of nearly 90% of the Senate. The President also expressed his commitment to working on a full-year agreement once the House passes the Senate compromise, which would prevent a tax hike on 160 million Americans starting January 1.
