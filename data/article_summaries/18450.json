In his weekly message, President Obama offered his thoughts and prayers to the people of Belgium and the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks in Brussels. He reiterated the support of the United States to Belgium in the fight against terrorism and emphasized that defeating ISIL remains the top military, intelligence, and national security priority. The President highlighted the importance of using the power of example as a nation that is open to refugees escaping ISIL violence, opposes ISIL's propaganda of hate and violence, and rejects any attempt to stigmatize American Muslims. He expressed confidence in defeating ISIL and stated that terrorists will fail in their attempts to make the US abandon its values and way of life. The President also discussed the ongoing efforts to eliminate ISIL's leadership and regain territory in Iraq, as well as the international coalition and increased cooperation with intelligence agencies in countering the threat. He emphasized the need to wield the power of example alongside military and diplomatic efforts, particularly in terms of welcoming refugees and rejecting attempts to stigmatize American Muslims. The President reassured that defeating ISIL remains a top priority and that terrorists will fail, as the future belongs to those who have the courage to build rather than destroy.
