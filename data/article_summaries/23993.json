President Barack Obama has sent a notice to the Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq will continue beyond May 22, 2010. This national emergency was declared in 2003 and has been modified and relied upon for additional steps taken since then. The obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the maintenance of peace and security, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in the country still pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The Iraqi government is taking steps to resolve debts and settle claims, and the US administration will review their progress before the end of the year to determine whether certain prohibitions should continue to be in effect. These prohibitions include any attachment, judgment, lien, or other judicial process with respect to the Development Fund for Iraq, the Central Bank of Iraq's accounts, assets, and property, and Iraqi petroleum-related products.
