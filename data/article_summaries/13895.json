This article is a notice from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. The national emergency was initially declared on March 15, 1995, due to the actions and policies of the Iranian government posing a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The President issued subsequent executive orders in 1995 and 1997 to impose sanctions on Iran in response to this threat. The national emergency is being extended for another year because the actions and policies of the Iranian government still pose a threat to the United States. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
