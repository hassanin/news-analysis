Yesterday's ruling in Arizona is being criticized as dangerous and regressive, with potential consequences that could set women back more than a century. If the decision is upheld, healthcare providers could face imprisonment for fulfilling their duty of care, survivors of rape and incest would be forced to carry their assaulters' children, and women with medical conditions would face serious health risks. This ruling is seen as part of a disturbing trend among Republican officials, who are determined to strip women of their rights. The President and Vice President will continue to advocate for the codification of Roe to protect women's access to abortion and healthcare.
