During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced that President Biden is committed to addressing the rising fuel prices due to President Putin's price hike and the impact of the war in Ukraine on global fuel supply. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued an emergency fuel waiver to allow the sale of E15 fuel during the summer driving season. This waiver is part of the President's efforts to increase the use of biofuels and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. E15 can save families 10 cents per gallon of gas on average. The President has also authorized the release of 1 million barrels per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and worked to build a coalition to release an additional 60 million barrels. Psaki also provided a quick overview of the President's schedule for the week ahead, including attending the White House Correspondents' Dinner, traveling to Minneapolis for a memorial service, and hosting various events at the White House. Psaki addressed questions about the supplemental funding request for Ukraine, the European Union's potential ban on Russian oil imports, the E15 fuel waiver, and the President's stance on Russia's participation in the G20 Summit. She also discussed the retirement of a White House crew member and answered questions about vaccine supply for children, inflation, disinformation efforts, and the lifting of Title 42 at the border.
