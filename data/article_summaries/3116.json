The United States, under President Biden's leadership, is working with other G7 countries to address key challenges and uphold shared values. The leaders have agreed on concrete actions regarding forced labor in global supply chains, the ransomware threat, and fighting corruption.

Regarding forced labor, the G7 partners are concerned about its use in various sectors, including agriculture, solar, and garment industries, particularly in Xinjiang. They emphasize the importance of human rights and international labor standards, committing to protect individuals from forced labor. The G7 partners aim to ensure that all global supply chains are free from forced labor, and they will work together to eradicate this practice.

The leaders also acknowledge the escalating threat of ransomware attacks, which have targeted critical infrastructure, manufacturing and electronics firms, and hospitals. They highlight the need for collaboration between governments and the private sector to enhance the resilience of critical infrastructure, investigate and prosecute cybercriminals, strengthen collective cyber defenses, and address criminal activities in their respective countries.

Additionally, the G7 countries recognize the destructive impact of corruption on public trust, government effectiveness, and economies. They commit to taking meaningful actions to combat corruption, including addressing the misuse of shell companies, preventing money laundering in real estate transactions, improving information sharing, and prioritizing anti-corruption efforts in foreign assistance.

More details on these commitments will be included in the G7 Leaders' Communique.
