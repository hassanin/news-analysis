On August 11, 2009, the White House released a statement by the President regarding the conviction and sentencing of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma. The President stated that her conviction and sentencing violated universal principles of human rights, went against Burma's commitments under the ASEAN charter, and demonstrated a disregard for UN Security Council statements. The President joined the international community in calling for Aung San Suu Kyi's immediate and unconditional release, and emphasized the importance of recognizing the rights and aspirations of all Burmese citizens. The President also expressed concern over the sentencing of American citizen John Yettaw, stating that his punishment was disproportionate to his actions.
