This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to certain actions that undermine the sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic processes or institutions. The President declared this national emergency on August 1, 2007, and ordered measures to block the property of individuals involved in undermining Lebanon's sovereignty or democratic processes. The President determined that these actions contribute to political and economic instability in Lebanon and pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Ongoing activities, such as arms transfers to Hizballah, are seen as undermining Lebanese sovereignty and contributing to instability in the country. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2007 and the measures adopted at that time will continue to be in effect beyond August 1, 2012. This notice is being published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
