On February 12, 2014, the President signed two laws: H.R. 2860, the "OPM IG Act," and S. 1901, the "Support for United States-Republic of Korea Civil Nuclear Cooperation Act." The OPM IG Act grants authority to the Inspector General of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to use funds from OPM's revolving fund to audit, investigate, and oversee the activities of that fund. The Support for United States-Republic of Korea Civil Nuclear Cooperation Act authorizes the President to extend an existing nuclear cooperation agreement with South Korea for up to two years, until March 19, 2016.
