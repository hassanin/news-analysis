The article discusses a letter written by President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate. The letter states that the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, which was declared in 1995, is to continue beyond October 21, 2015. The letter explains that the circumstances that led to the declaration of the national emergency have not been resolved, and that the actions of these traffickers continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
