The legislation discussed in the article authorizes the Department of Justice to provide resources to state and local law enforcement in order to ensure that criminals are brought to justice. It emphasizes the importance of DNA evidence in identifying criminals and highlights the issue of thousands of untested rape kits across the country. The Debbie Smith Act, which provides resources to address the backlog of untested DNA evidence, is mentioned as an important component of this legislation. President Donald J. Trump is proud to have worked with Congress to achieve this bipartisan reauthorization, specifically mentioning Congresswoman Wagner and Senators Cornyn and Grassley.
