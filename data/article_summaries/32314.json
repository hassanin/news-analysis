The article discusses Judge Brett Kavanaugh's response to the allegations made by Deborah Ramirez in The New Yorker. Kavanaugh denies the alleged incident, stating that it did not happen 35 years ago. He claims that those who knew him at the time have also denied the allegations. Kavanaugh refers to the allegations as a smear and expresses his intention to testify and defend his reputation. The article highlights the significant gaps in Ramirez's memories about the event and her initial reluctance to speak with certainty. It is mentioned that it took six days for Ramirez to recall the incident after consulting with a Democratic attorney.

A former student and close friend of Ramirez also claims that she was never told about the incident.
