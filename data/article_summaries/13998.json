This article is a notice from the White House, issued on May 3, 2010, announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the actions of the government of Syria. The national emergency was initially declared on May 11, 2004, and authorized the blocking of property and the prohibition of certain goods to Syria. Additional executive orders were issued in 2006 and 2008 to address the threat posed by Syria's support for terrorism, occupation of Lebanon, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining of U.S. and international efforts in Iraq. While some progress has been made by the Syrian government in suppressing foreign fighters bound for Iraq, their actions and policies, including support for terrorist organizations and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, continue to pose a threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy. The national emergency will continue for another year, and changes in the policies and actions of the Syrian government will be considered in determining whether to continue or terminate the national emergency in the future.
