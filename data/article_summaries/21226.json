President Obama has amended the disaster declaration for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians to provide additional disaster assistance. The amendment authorizes an increase in federal funding for Public Assistance projects undertaken by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians as a result of severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred from January 14-17, 2013. Initially, federal funding was available at a rate of 75% of total eligible costs. However, under the President's order, the federal share for Public Assistance has been increased to 90% of the total eligible costs.
