President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New Mexico and ordered federal aid to supplement recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that occurred from July 27 to August 5, 2014. The declaration makes federal funding available to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding. Nancy M. Casper has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state.
