The article discusses the humanitarian and security crisis at the southwest border of the United States. Kirstjen Nielsen, the Secretary of Homeland Security, emphasizes the need for decisive action to address the increasing risks faced by vulnerable populations, particularly families and children at the border. The smuggling of deadly drugs like fentanyl is on the rise, and there is a significant number of criminals, including convicted offenders and gang members, attempting to cross the southern border. Additionally, there is a humanitarian catastrophe as families and children now make up the majority of those entering illegally, taking advantage of the broken legal framework that provides a "free pass" into the US. The journey to the border has become perilous, with high rates of sexual assault and violence reported by migrants. The article calls for Congress to take the crisis seriously and implement effective measures to address the situation.
