The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to engage communities with high numbers of uninsured individuals in states across the country. The goal is to encourage community leadership to build outreach efforts and help the uninsured gain coverage through the Affordable Care Act. At the end of the open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of new Marketplace signups in participating communities to the estimated number of eligible uninsured individuals to determine which communities made the most progress. The winning community will receive recognition, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama. Oakland, California is one of the communities participating in the challenge. The article also provides information on health insurance coverage in California, including the average monthly premium increase, the number of issuers offering plans, and the benefits of tax credits. It highlights the progress made in reducing the uninsured rate in California and the number of uninsured individuals eligible for the Marketplace in Oakland.
