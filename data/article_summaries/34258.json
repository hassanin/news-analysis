The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced $2.9 million in grants to help local programs combat the effects of the opioid epidemic in their communities. The grants, called "Combating Opioid Overdose through Community-Level Intervention," were given to 12 programs in areas of the United States that have experienced high levels of opioid and illicit drug abuse. The University of Baltimore will oversee the projects, which will employ various approaches such as identifying individuals at risk of overdosing, supporting medication-assisted treatment in jails, collaborating with public safety agencies, and connecting high-risk pregnant and postpartum women and their children to opioid use disorder care coordination services. The funding will support projects in 10 states: Connecticut, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.
