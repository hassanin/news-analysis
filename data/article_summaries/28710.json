The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced nearly $13 million in discretionary funding to help states and law enforcement respond to the drug crisis and curb drug trafficking. The funding includes $1.6 million for 13 counties in 12 states that were recently designated as High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA), and $5 million to expand the Overdose Response Strategy (ORS) to cover 21 HIDTAs in 34 states and the District of Columbia. The ORS aims to reduce drug overdoses by implementing evidence-based interventions and improving information sharing among federal agencies and participating states. The funding reflects the Trump Administration's commitment to addressing the addiction crisis in America.
