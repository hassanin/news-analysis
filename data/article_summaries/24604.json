President Obama has announced new actions to promote rehabilitation and reintegration for formerly incarcerated individuals. These actions include providing grants for reentry education, releasing guidance on the use of arrests in determining housing eligibility, and "banning the box" on federal job applications. The President also announced commitments to expand tech training and jobs for individuals with criminal records, establish a National Clean Slate Clearinghouse, and provide support for reentry housing and legal services. These actions are part of the Obama Administration's commitment to reducing barriers to successful reintegration and improving opportunities for justice-involved individuals.
