On March 26, 2020, the President signed four laws related to veterans. The first law, H.R. 1365, authorizes the payment of eligible claims to victims and survivors of the attack and occupation of Guam by the Imperial Japanese forces. The second law, H.R. 4803, known as the "Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act," allows foreign-born children of U.S. citizen members of the Armed Forces or Government employees stationed abroad to automatically acquire U.S. citizenship, even if they are not residing in the United States. The third law, S. 760, called the "Support for Veterans in Effective Apprenticeships Act," aims to improve coordination between the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding individuals using VA education benefits for apprenticeship programs. Lastly, S. 1678, the "Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 2019," requires the Department of State to report to Congress on steps taken by the U.S. government to strengthen Taiwan's diplomatic relations with other partners in the Indo-Pacific region and change the United States' engagement with nations that undermine Taiwan's security or prosperity.
