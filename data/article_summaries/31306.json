President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12947 regarding foreign terrorists threatening to disrupt the Middle East peace process will continue beyond January 23, 2019. The crisis has not been resolved as terrorist groups continue to engage in activities that threaten the peace process and are hostile to US interests in the region. The president has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency and the sanctions against these terrorists to address the threat.
