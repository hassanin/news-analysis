The White House has announced that Montana has become the 30th state, along with the District of Columbia, to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. This expansion will provide access to quality, affordable healthcare for 70,000 Montanans who would otherwise go without insurance. The move is aimed at reducing the burden of uncompensated costs on hospitals and businesses in the state. The White House hopes that other states will follow Montana's lead in prioritizing the healthcare needs of their residents.
