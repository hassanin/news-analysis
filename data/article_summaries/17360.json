Gene B. Sperling, Director of the National Economic Council, expressed disappointment in Congress for blocking the renewal of Trade Adjustment Assistance. This will result in 155,000 Americans losing access to job training, hindering their ability to support their families and compete globally. Sperling emphasized the importance of supporting workers during the economic recovery and urged Congress to extend this vital assistance.
