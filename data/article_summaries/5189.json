Yesterday, the White House hosted a roundtable with intersex advocates to celebrate Intersex Awareness Day. The participants discussed the challenges faced by intersex Americans, including stigma, discrimination, and non-consensual medical interventions. They emphasized the need for health equity, non-discrimination protections, and increased visibility for intersex individuals. The White House officials expressed gratitude for the advocates' work and reaffirmed the administration's commitment to justice and safety for intersex Americans. The Department of Education also released a new resource on protecting the rights of intersex students.
