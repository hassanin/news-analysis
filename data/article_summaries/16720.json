In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims January 2010 as National Mentoring Month in the United States. He recognizes the important role that mentors play in supporting and guiding young people, and encourages Americans to give back by mentoring youth in their communities. Mentors, including tutors, coaches, teachers, volunteers, and friends, provide crucial support and guidance to children who may lack positive influences in their lives. The impact of mentors can fulfill critical needs that public services often overlook. While the government can improve schools and provide resources, a strong role model can motivate students and keep them out of harm's way. Mentors help children grow into productive, engaged, and responsible adults. The president calls upon public officials, business and community leaders, educators, and all Americans to observe National Mentoring Month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
