President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation designating May 15, 2014, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 11 through May 17, 2014, as Police Week. During this time, Americans are encouraged to honor and celebrate the men and women who protect and serve their communities. The proclamation highlights the commitment and sacrifices made by police officers in defending schools, businesses, and neighborhoods. It also emphasizes the need to support and protect law enforcement officers, including providing necessary resources, hiring new officers, and investing in training. The proclamation calls on all Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and for flags to be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day.
