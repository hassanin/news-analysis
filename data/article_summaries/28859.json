The presidential memorandum issued on September 2, 2020, titled "Reviewing Funding to State and Local Government Recipients of Federal Funds That Are Permitting Anarchy, Violence, and Destruction in American Cities," outlines the policy and purpose of the United States Government to protect lives and property from unlawful acts of violence and destruction. It highlights specific instances in cities such as Seattle, Portland, and New York where violence and lawlessness have persisted due to the failure of state and local governments to enforce the law and accept federal law enforcement assistance. The memorandum emphasizes that federal funds should not be used to support cities that allow lawlessness and directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review the use of federal funds by these jurisdictions. It also instructs the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of OMB, to identify and publish a list of "anarchist jurisdictions" that have permitted violence and destruction to persist. Furthermore, agencies are directed to restrict or disfavor anarchist jurisdictions in the receipt of federal grants. The memorandum includes general provisions to ensure its implementation is consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
