Vice President Biden has announced that Kathleen S. Tighe will replace Earl Devaney as the chair of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB). The RATB was created to ensure transparency and accountability in the distribution of funds under the Recovery Act. Tighe will continue to uphold the high standards set by Devaney as the top watchdog for the Recovery Act. The RATB has been successful in its mission of providing oversight by creating websites and deploying systems to track how Recovery Act funds are being used. The Board will terminate operations on September 30, 2013. Tighe, who is currently serving as the Inspector General for the Department of Education, is well-positioned to lead the Board in achieving its goals. She has extensive experience in government oversight and has served in various roles in different departments. Tighe has also lectured on government and industry groups on topics related to fraud and investigation. She holds a law degree from George Washington University and a master's degree in International Relations from American University.
