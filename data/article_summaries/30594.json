Second Lady Karen Pence has continued the tradition of decorating the Vice President's Residence for Christmas. The theme this year is "Make the Season Bright" and includes metallic ornaments, stars, and candles. The residence has four Christmas trees, thirty-six wreaths, nearly a mile of Christmas lights, and 800 yards of ribbon. Around 40 staff and volunteers helped with the decorations. The foyer features a fireplace with stockings for all members of the Pence family, including their pets. Throughout December, the Pence family will welcome over 2,000 guests into the residence.
