The White House has announced its intention to suspend the designation of Bangladesh as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. This decision is based on the country's failure to provide internationally recognized worker rights to its workers. The President has determined that Bangladesh does not meet the requirements set forth in the Trade Act of 1974 and therefore should be suspended from the GSP program.
