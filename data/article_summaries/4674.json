The speaker begins by expressing gratitude to the audience and highlighting the importance of the National Press Club. They then reflect on President Kennedy's address to the nation 60 years ago, where he discussed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the significance of responsible arms control. The speaker emphasizes the erosion of the foundation of nuclear stability and security in recent years.

They mention Russia's reckless attack on the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in Ukraine and their suspension of the New START Treaty. They also highlight Russia's violation of the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe. The speaker argues that Russia has destabilized the nuclear arms control framework.

The speaker then discusses China's nuclear buildup and their lack of willingness to engage in substantive dialogue on arms control. They note the increasing nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran.

In response to these challenges, the speaker outlines a two-pronged approach. First, they discuss the modernization of the US nuclear program, including the replacement of each leg of the nuclear Triad and the development of cutting-edge non-nuclear capabilities. Second, they emphasize the importance of strengthening alliances abroad, such as reaffirming mutual defense treaties and modernizing NATO's nuclear capabilities.

The speaker then moves on to discuss the US's approach to arms control. They express a willingness to engage in bilateral arms control discussions with Russia and China without preconditions. They also highlight the possibility of multilateral arms control efforts involving the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (P5) and propose specific measures to manage nuclear risks and arms racing.

Lastly, the speaker emphasizes the US's commitment to setting norms and values in the new nuclear era, including addressing the challenges posed by emerging technologies such as hypersonic weapons and artificial intelligence. They mention the US's proposals for responsible behavior in space and principles for the use of AI in the military domain.

The speaker concludes by invoking President Kennedy's spirit of hope and expressing belief in the possibility of building a world free of nuclear weapons through new deterrence and arms control measures. They express a commitment to working towards this goal and look forward to the conversation ahead.
