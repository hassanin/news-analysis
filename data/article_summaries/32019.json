President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Texas and ordered Federal assistance to aid in recovery efforts from severe storms and flooding that occurred between September 10 and November 2, 2018. Federal funding will be available to State and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in several counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for cost-sharing funding. Jerry S. Thomas has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Further designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments. The media can contact the FEMA News Desk for more information.
