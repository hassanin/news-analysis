On October 14, 2019, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the situation in and in relation to Syria. This declaration was made due to the actions of the Government of Turkey conducting a military offensive into northeast Syria, which was seen as undermining the campaign to defeat ISIS, endangering civilians, and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region. The national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894 was set to expire on October 14, 2022, but President Biden has decided to continue it for one more year, citing the ongoing threat to national security and foreign policy. This decision is in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act.
