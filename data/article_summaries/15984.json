The United States expresses deep disappointment over the conviction and sentencing of Leopoldo López to 13 years and 9 months imprisonment on politically-motivated charges. The US believes that citizens should have the right to engage in political discourse and express their views without fear of detention or harassment. The Venezuelan government is responsible for protecting these fundamental freedoms, and the prosecution and sentencing of López, as well as the conduct of his trial, have revealed significant failures in Venezuela's rule of law and judicial system. The US calls on the Venezuelan government to release López and all other political prisoners who are unjustly detained.
