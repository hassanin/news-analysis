President Obama has declared a major disaster in Pennsylvania due to a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in January 2016. Federal funding will be provided to assist with recovery efforts and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The funding will be available to local governments and certain nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis. Snow assistance will also be provided for a continuous 48-hour period in certain counties. Additionally, federal funding will be available for hazard mitigation measures in all counties within Pennsylvania. Donald L. Keldsen has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Further damage assessments may result in additional designations.
