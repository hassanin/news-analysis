The White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, gave a briefing on the ongoing debt talks. He mentioned that the President and his team have been in conversations with leaders and relevant staff since Thursday. The President continues to push for the biggest possible deficit reduction package and believes that there is an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to work together to achieve this. Carney also mentioned that conversations about a backup measure, such as the one proposed by Senator McConnell, have been ongoing. He stated that it has always been difficult to convince everyone at the table to put their partisan politics aside and reach a compromise. Carney emphasized the importance of reaching a deal before the August 2nd deadline to raise the debt ceiling to avoid defaulting on the country's obligations. He also mentioned the President's support for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and his belief that Richard Cordray is the right person to lead it. Carney did not provide specific details about the ongoing negotiations or the potential outcome of the debt talks.
