The senior administration official provided an update on the G7 summit, highlighting the significant convergence among the member countries in their approach towards China. In previous years, China was not explicitly mentioned in the communiqué, but this year there is a strong and shared foundation for a joint approach. The areas of convergence include addressing China's non-market economic practices, speaking out on human rights abuses in Xinjiang, taking action against forced labor in supply chains, and coordinating on supply chain resilience and technology standards. The official mentioned that the communiqué is expected to be released around midday tomorrow. During the Q&A session, the official clarified that while there is a willingness to call out human rights abuses and criticize non-market economic practices, the specific details of the communiqué are yet to be finalized. The official also emphasized the commitment to take action in response to these issues and highlighted the shared values of democracies that bind the G7 partnership.
