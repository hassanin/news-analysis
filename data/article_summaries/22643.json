President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring October 9-15, 2016 as National School Lunch Week. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the National School Lunch Program, which was created to provide lunch to children in need. Today, more than 30 million children depend on this program each day. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of proper nutrition in the welfare of children and the role that the National School Lunch Program plays in ensuring access to nutritious meals for all students. The proclamation also highlights efforts to improve the quality of school meals, increase access to nutrition for low-income students, and address the issue of inadequate nutrition during the summer months. The proclamation recognizes the Let's Move! initiative led by First Lady Michelle Obama, which aims to promote healthier meals in schools and increase access to healthy, affordable food for families. The proclamation calls on all Americans to support the health and well-being of the nation's children by participating in activities that promote the National School Lunch Program.
