The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has released a report on the employment challenges faced by military spouses. The report highlights that military spouses, who number approximately 690,000, come from diverse backgrounds and bring a variety of skills to the labor market. However, they often face difficulties in finding employment due to the geographic and temporal constraints imposed by their active duty spouse. This is particularly true for spouses stationed abroad, as they often do not receive spousal work visas. Even for spouses stationed stateside, frequent moves every two to three years make it challenging to find and maintain employment. Employers may be hesitant to hire military spouses due to turnover costs, and short cycles in each location make it harder for spouses to recoup the costs of occupational licensing and other fixed labor force participation costs. The report emphasizes that military spouses may be the quintessential "trailing spouse," facing additional challenges due to location assignments rather than choices.
