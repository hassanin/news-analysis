This letter, written by President Barack Obama on October 24, 2012, explains the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The letter cites Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, which states that a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice stating its continuation. The President has determined that the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, characterized by widespread violence and threats to regional stability, still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, he has decided to continue the national emergency and the related measures blocking the property of certain individuals contributing to the conflict in the country.
