President Obama expresses his disappointment that the effort to hold oil companies fully accountable for the disasters they cause has been stalled in the United States Senate on a partisan basis. He warns that this maneuver puts taxpayers at risk of having to bear the financial burden of future disasters like the BP oil spill. The President urges Senate Republicans to put aside special interest politics and work together in a bipartisan effort to protect taxpayers and hold oil companies accountable.
