The Equitable Data Working Group was established under Executive Order 13985 to improve data collection practices in the federal government in order to advance equity. The group is composed of government leaders from various disciplines and is focused on addressing data inadequacies and gaps in order to measure and promote equity. They are conducting case studies to identify challenges and make recommendations for improving equitable data practices. The group aims to prioritize cases that can have immediate value for local communities, policymakers, and researchers. They are also exploring ways to leverage government data and promote data sharing to answer key policy questions. Privacy protection and unintentional disclosure of personal information are important considerations in their work. The group also recognizes the need to collect additional information on underserved communities, such as LGBTQ+ Americans, to ensure equitable outcomes. They are working with federal agencies to include questions about sexual orientation and gender identity in surveys and datasets. The Equitable Data Working Group will provide an initial report with barriers and recommendations to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy by Fall 2021. They are seeking partnerships with various stakeholders to leverage federal data for analysis and insights on biased policies. The group plans to keep the public updated on their work and welcomes input and engagement from the public.
