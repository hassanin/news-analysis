On World Autism Awareness Day, President Joe Biden reaffirms the commitment to support and empower the more than 5 million Americans living with autism. While progress has been made in improving access to opportunities for people with developmental disabilities, there are still gaps in employment and income for many autistic individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequities, creating additional challenges for people with autism and their families. The administration is dedicated to addressing the systemic barriers faced by autistic individuals and is working to accelerate pandemic recovery for special education programs. Efforts are also being made to ensure individuals with disabilities, including autism, have access to affordable housing. Funding for cutting-edge research to better understand, diagnose, and treat autism is a priority, as well as reducing barriers to early diagnoses, interventions, and services. The administration aims to create a more diverse and inclusive Federal workforce, including expanding employment opportunities for people with disabilities, including autism. Ongoing efforts will focus on providing access to care, services, and support for autistic Americans, allowing them to pursue their educational, career, and life interests without discrimination. The proclamation encourages all Americans to learn more about autism, improve early diagnosis, listen to the experiences of autistic individuals, and create welcoming and inclusive communities.
