President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 27, 2014, as National Hunting and Fishing Day in the United States. In the proclamation, he recognizes the importance of these activities in connecting people to the nation's natural resources and instilling a conservation ethic. Hunting and fishing contribute to the preservation of land, water, and wildlife, and also support the economy, tourism, and recreation. The president highlights the need for effective conservation to ensure future generations can enjoy the beauty of the wilderness. He mentions the efforts of hunters and anglers in championing sustainable practices and supporting environmental stewardship through hunting licenses and fees. The Obama administration has also taken steps to advance conservation priorities and increase access to land and water for outdoor recreational activities through initiatives like America's Great Outdoors. The president has designated millions of acres of Federal wilderness, protected rivers, and established or expanded National Monuments. He calls on Congress to fully and permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to further expand public spaces. The proclamation encourages Americans to observe National Hunting and Fishing Day with appropriate programs and activities.
