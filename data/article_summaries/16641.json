President Obama has announced his intent to nominate Kent Hirozawa and Nancy Schiffer to key administration posts in the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Hirozawa is currently the chief counsel to NLRB Chairman Mark Pearce and has extensive experience in labor and employment law. Schiffer, on the other hand, has worked for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) and the United Auto Workers (UAW) in various legal capacities. Both nominees have a strong background in labor relations and are expected to contribute to the agency's mission of promoting better wages and conditions for American workers.
