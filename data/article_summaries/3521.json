The article discusses the need for investment and improvement in the infrastructure of goods movement supply chains in the United States. It highlights the strain placed on the infrastructure by the increase in goods movement during the pandemic and the impact of extreme weather events on American lives and livelihoods. The Biden Administration has already taken steps to address these issues, including partnerships with ports and private sector leaders to accelerate operations and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal aims to make fundamental changes to ports, airports, rail, and roads to enhance supply chain resilience and efficiency. The legislation includes investments in port and airport infrastructure, repairs and improvements to roads and bridges, and enhancements to freight rail and intermodal infrastructure. It also focuses on making the supply chain infrastructure resilient against climate change, cyber-attacks, and extreme weather events. Overall, the legislation aims to strengthen supply chains, reduce costs, improve competitiveness, and reduce emissions while prioritizing environmental justice and supporting historically disadvantaged communities.
