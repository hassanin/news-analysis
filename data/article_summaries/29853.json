President Trump has signed an executive order titled "Modernizing America's Water Resource Management and Water Infrastructure" to improve the management of the United States' water resources. The order establishes a Water Subcabinet that will develop a national water strategy and promote coordination and consolidation of federal interagency water-related task forces and working groups. The Subcabinet will also work with state, local, and tribal partners to address water resource management challenges, develop research plans to improve forecasting methods, and identify opportunities to recruit, train, and retain water professionals across the country. The goal is to upgrade infrastructure and ensure reliable and safe water supplies for current and future generations.
