President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation recognizing December 3, 2015, as International Day of Persons with Disabilities. The United States has been a leader in advocating for the rights of individuals with disabilities, and this proclamation reaffirms the country's commitment to ensuring equal opportunities and rights for all. The proclamation highlights the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the progress made in advancing disability rights since its passage. It also mentions the Affordable Care Act, which prevents denial of health insurance due to pre-existing conditions, and the support for increasing funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) grants. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of providing support to veterans with disabilities and ensuring their access to healthcare and career opportunities. President Obama also expresses disappointment that the Senate has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which recognizes the rights of individuals with disabilities and urges equal protection and benefits before the law. The proclamation calls on all Americans to observe International Day of Persons with Disabilities with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
