The White House is requesting $1.5 billion from Congress as part of its Fiscal Year 2015 Overseas Contingency Operations budget to counter terrorist organizations in the Middle East and North Africa. This includes a proposed authority to train and equip moderate Syrian opposition forces with $500 million. The funding aims to defend the Syrian people, stabilize areas under opposition control, provide essential services, counter terrorist threats, and promote conditions for a negotiated settlement. The request emphasizes that there is no military solution to the Syrian crisis and that American troops should not be involved in combat. However, it highlights the importance of empowering the Syrian people to defend themselves and enhance security and stability at the local level.
