The article is a statement from President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. The President determines that there is enough supply from other countries to significantly reduce the volume of petroleum purchased from Iran. This determination is made based on reports from the Energy Information Administration, global economic conditions, increased oil production by certain countries, spare capacity levels, and the availability of strategic reserves. The Secretary of State is directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register, and the situation will continue to be closely monitored.
