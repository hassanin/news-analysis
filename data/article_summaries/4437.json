The United States, along with its allies and partners, is imposing additional economic costs on Russia and Belarus in response to President Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The aim is to hold Belarus accountable, weaken the Russian defense sector, target Russia's sources of wealth, and ban Russian airlines from U.S. airspace. This multilateral coordination has resulted in over 30 countries implementing sanctions and export controls against Russia, isolating it from the international financial and trade system. Efforts are being made to prevent Putin from accessing his war chest to support the invasion by freezing the assets of his cronies and their families. To mitigate the impact on economies, 60 million barrels of oil will be released from strategic reserves. The United States and its allies will continue to impose costs on Russia as long as Putin escalates the situation.
