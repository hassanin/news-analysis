Vice President Biden announced the selection of 25 communities for up to $452 million in Recovery Act funding for energy efficiency building retrofits. These partnerships will support large-scale retrofits and make energy efficiency accessible to homeowners and businesses. The projects are expected to save households and businesses about $100 million annually in utility bills and create around 30,000 jobs over the next three years. The selected projects will leverage an estimated $2.8 billion from other sources over the next 3 years. The Retrofit Ramp-Up projects are part of the overall $80 billion Recovery Act investment in clean energy and energy efficiency.
