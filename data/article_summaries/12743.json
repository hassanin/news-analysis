The United States is disappointed with the conduct of Egypt's recent legislative elections. There were numerous reported irregularities at the polls, a lack of international monitors, and problems encountered by domestic monitors. The restrictions on basic freedoms of association, speech, and press leading up to the elections are also concerning. However, the United States commends the Egyptians who participated in the elections and looks forward to continuing to work with the Egyptian government and civil society to help Egypt achieve its political, social, and economic aspirations.
