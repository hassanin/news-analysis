The White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault has released a Resource Guide to support efforts in preventing and responding to sexual violence on college and university campuses. The guide includes guidance, tools, model policies and procedures, training, funding opportunities, and public messaging materials. The Task Force has also launched the It's On Us campaign, which aims to engage students and campus communities in changing the culture to prevent sexual assault. The Resource Guide provides resources for campus climate surveys, prevention tools, training and technical assistance, sexual misconduct policies and procedures, community partnerships, public awareness and engagement initiatives, data and information sharing, funding opportunities, and related law and policy sources. The Task Force has been working to address campus sexual assault since it was established in January 2014, and has released various reports and resources in collaboration with student leaders, school representatives, advocates, policymakers, and other stakeholders.
