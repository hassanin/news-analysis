Unions are rallying support for Julie Su, President Joe Biden's pick for U.S Labor Secretary, as they seek to prevent a defeat that would hinder the administration's worker-focused agenda. Republicans have unanimously opposed Su's nomination, so the focus is now on moderate senators who have yet to announce their stance. The AFL-CIO has launched a campaign called "Stand with Su" to garner support for her confirmation, targeting local affiliates and running ads in Washington, D.C. and Arizona. The campaign highlights Su's alignment with former Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, who has been actively advocating for her. However, Republicans argue that Su would be more left-leaning than Walsh. The battle over Su's confirmation is the Biden administration's first attempt at replacing a Cabinet secretary and presents a test for Democratic leadership. If confirmed, Su would be Biden's first Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Cabinet secretary.
