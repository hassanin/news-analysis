Vice President Mike Pence wrote an op-ed in The Des Moines Register, stating that tax cuts are working in Iowa. He mentioned that the tax cuts benefit hard-working Iowans, with the first $24,000 in income for a married couple being tax-free and the child tax credit being doubled. He also stated that 90% of working families will soon see the tax cut reflected in their paychecks. Pence estimated that the typical Iowa family of four will see a tax cut of almost $2,500. The tax cuts also extended to job creators, with the corporate tax rate being slashed and significant tax relief being given to small businesses and family farms. Pence highlighted that these tax cuts have led to companies investing in Iowa workers, with many workers receiving bonuses and raises. Overall, working families in Iowa can expect their paychecks to grow by more than $4,100 a year.
