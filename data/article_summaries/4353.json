Today, the White House Working Group on Puerto Rico, chaired by Domestic Policy Advisor Susan E. Rice, National Economic Advisor Brian Deese, and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Julie Rodriguez, held its inaugural meeting. The purpose of the working group is to provide Puerto Rico with the resources and technical assistance it needs to recover and prosper. The meeting discussed President Biden's plan for Puerto Rico, which focuses on dignity, equity, and respect, as well as his commitment to supporting the island's full recovery from Hurricanes Maria and Irma, the 2020 earthquakes, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan includes not just rebuilding efforts but also investments in the long-term resilience of the island's communities and infrastructure. Briefings were provided by the Departments of the Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, Education, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency on their efforts to advance a comprehensive and holistic approach for Puerto Rico's future prosperity.
