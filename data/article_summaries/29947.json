First Lady Melania Trump and New Jersey First Lady Tammy Murphy held a call to discuss child welfare and well-being, following their previous interaction in a video-teleconference briefing with the nation's governors. They were joined by Carole Johnson, Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Human Services. The call focused on how New Jersey has adapted to deliver social services remotely, including the successful expansion of its mental health hotline. The importance of technology in the delivery of remote services, particularly for families and children, was also discussed, as well as the role of technology in increasing access to mental health services. The two First Ladies also talked about Nurture NJ, a statewide awareness campaign launched by Mrs. Murphy in 2019 to reduce infant and maternal mortality and morbidity. They agreed on the importance of ensuring equity in care and outcomes for all, and discussed efforts to lower the high mortality rate for African-American mothers in New Jersey. Mrs. Trump spoke about her Be Best initiative, which focuses on a child's social, emotional, and physical health, and identified shared goals between the two initiatives. They agreed to stay in touch and continue finding ways to work together amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
