President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 18 to September 24, 2011, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. In this proclamation, he recognizes the important role that historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have played in providing educational opportunities to young people in the United States. HBCUs have produced many leaders in various fields and are seen as centers of intellectual inquiry and innovation. The proclamation calls on educators, public officials, organizations, corporations, and the American people to observe this week with appropriate programs and activities that acknowledge the contributions of HBCUs and their alumni.
