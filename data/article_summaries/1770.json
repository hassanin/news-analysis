In this article, President Joe Biden expresses his support for Registered Apprenticeship programs during National Apprenticeship Week. He believes that the middle class, which has built America, was built by unions, and these apprenticeship programs have produced some of the best-trained workers in the world. Biden emphasizes that his goal is to build an economy that benefits every American willing to work hard, and Registered Apprenticeships provide a pathway to good-paying jobs. He highlights the importance of apprenticeships in strengthening the current workforce and equipping workers with the skills needed for future industries, such as clean energy and cybersecurity. The Biden administration has invested more in these programs than any previous administration, including through the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. They have developed over 4,000 new Registered Apprenticeship programs and helped hire over one million new apprentices. The administration has also launched initiatives to diversify apprenticeships across industries and support women in entering skilled trades. They are working with various sectors, including advanced manufacturing, education, construction, and cybersecurity, to address workforce needs and expand apprenticeship programs. Biden concludes by emphasizing the importance of investing in America and American workers, and he proclaims November 12 to 18, 2023, as National Apprenticeship Week, urging all stakeholders to support and raise awareness of Registered Apprenticeship programs.
