President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, will continue for an additional year. The President believes that the terrorist threat that led to the initial declaration of the emergency still persists, and therefore it is necessary to keep the national emergency in effect beyond September 14, 2011.
