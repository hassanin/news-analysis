President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has transmitted an Extradition Treaty between the United States and Albania to the Senate for ratification. The Treaty, signed on December 22, 2020, aims to replace the existing extradition treaty signed in 1933. The new Treaty incorporates a "dual criminality" approach, allowing extradition for offenses like money laundering and cyber-related crimes that were not previously covered. It also includes a modernized clause on political offenses and ensures that extradition cannot be refused based on the person's nationality. Additionally, the Treaty introduces procedural improvements to streamline and expedite the extradition process. President Biden recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty and provide its advice and consent for ratification.
