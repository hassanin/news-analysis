This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama in April 2012. The memorandum addresses the issue of domestic violence in the federal workforce and emphasizes the need for the federal government to act as a model in responding to this problem. The memorandum states that domestic violence causes significant injuries and even deaths in the United States, and it also has a negative impact on workplace productivity and healthcare costs. The memorandum directs the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to issue guidance to federal agencies on preventing domestic violence and addressing its effects on the workforce. The guidance includes steps agencies can take for early intervention and prevention, assistance for employee victims, leave policies, disciplinary actions, workplace safety improvements, and resources for best practices. Each agency is required to develop or modify agency-specific policies within a certain timeframe and submit them for review. The memorandum includes general provisions and clarifies that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
