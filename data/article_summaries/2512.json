President Biden and Vice President Harris met with leaders of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Dominican Republic at the Ninth Summit of the Americas. They discussed the economic challenges facing these countries, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, food and energy insecurity, and lack of access to financing. To address these challenges, three high-level committees will be formed to develop joint solutions. The United States also launched the U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC 2030), which aims to facilitate renewable energy infrastructure development and increase access to financing. The United States will provide $28 million in new food security assistance to Caribbean countries and work with CARICOM to launch a Caribbean Zero Hunger Plan. The leaders also discussed strengthening security cooperation, countering small arms trafficking, and supporting national action plans to combat firearms trafficking. Additionally, they reaffirmed their commitment to promoting and defending democracy and the rule of law.
