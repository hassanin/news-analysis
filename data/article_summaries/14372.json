The article discusses the growing investment from India in the United States and its impact on the American economy. Over the past decade, Indian investment in the U.S. has grown at an annual rate of 53%, reaching $4.4 billion in 2009. This investment has contributed to the growth of the American economy and the creation of jobs. Indian-owned firms have aided in the turnaround of struggling U.S. companies, saving jobs and improving performance. Some notable examples include the Essar Group's investment in Minnesota Steel Industries and the Tata Group's investment throughout the country. Indian investment capital is spread across different regions in the U.S., supporting employment in areas that faced difficulties during the economic downturn. The largest share of investment has been allocated to industries associated with the knowledge economy, such as IT and pharmaceuticals. It is expected that Indian investment in the U.S. will continue to grow, particularly in industries like power, steel, extractive industries, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare. This inflow of capital will create jobs and help the U.S. remain competitive in global markets.
