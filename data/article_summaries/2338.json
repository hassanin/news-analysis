President Biden delivered a speech in the Rose Garden outlining his administration's plans to increase access to high-quality childcare and support caregivers. He emphasized the importance of treating those who need care, such as children, people with disabilities, and veterans, with dignity and valuing the caregivers who provide for them. The executive order he signed includes over 50 actions that federal agencies will take to improve the care industry. The order does not require new spending but focuses on maximizing the value of existing investments. Some of the actions include increasing wages for childcare workers, strengthening staffing standards at nursing homes, and providing more flexibility for veterans to choose their own caregivers. The President also highlighted the need to expand partnerships with community colleges and apprenticeship programs to ensure an adequate supply of care workers. He acknowledged the challenges faced by family caregivers and expressed his commitment to improving their support. President Biden mentioned the high cost of care for seniors in nursing homes and working families with young children, as well as the low pay for care workers. He stressed the need to address these issues to alleviate the burden on families and boost the nation's productivity and economic growth. The President criticized the Republican party for proposing cuts to important programs and tax giveaways for the wealthy while refusing to ask them to pay more in taxes. He called on Congress to pass his budget and urged them to take the threat of default off the table. President Biden concluded by expressing his optimism for the future of America and the potential for progress if everyone works together.
