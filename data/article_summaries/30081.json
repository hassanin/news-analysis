On the 244th birthday of the United States Navy, the President sends greetings to the sailors currently serving and those who have served our Nation with honor, courage, and commitment in times of war and peace, at home and around the world. The Continental Congress created America's first national navy in October 1775, just months after the onset of the Revolutionary War. The Navy has grown into the largest and most formidable naval force the world has ever known. This month, America will commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the largest naval battle of the modern era. The President highlights the heroic story of Task Unit 77.4.3, known as "Taffy 3," in which American destroyers charged into a line of massive Japanese battleships to protect the rest of the force attempting to liberate the Philippine Islands. The President expresses gratitude to America's sailors and all service members for their willingness to defend the country's liberties and prosperity.
