President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 will continue beyond December 20, 2019. The national emergency was initially declared in December 2017 and is related to human rights abuse and corruption that originate outside the United States. The President believes that these issues pose a significant threat to international political and economic systems, as they undermine democratic institutions, weaken the rule of law, perpetuate conflicts, and harm individuals. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency in order to address these ongoing threats to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States.
