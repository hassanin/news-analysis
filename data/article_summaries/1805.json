The President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Belarus, which was initially declared in Executive Order 13405 on June 16, 2006, and expanded in scope in Executive Order 14038 on August 9, 2021, will continue beyond June 16, 2022. The President believes that the actions and policies of certain members of the Belarusian government, as well as other individuals, along with the regime's harmful activities and long-standing abuses, still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
