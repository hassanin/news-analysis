President Obama is urging Congress to implement reforms to prevent the "potential takeover of our elections by corporations" in response to a recent Supreme Court ruling. The ruling allows special interests, corporations, and potentially foreign citizens to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence election outcomes. Obama is calling for reforms that would require campaign committees to disclose their sources of funding and hold leaders and financiers accountable for their advertisements. The reforms would also restrict foreign corporations and citizens from spending money on US elections. Obama argues that these reforms are necessary to ensure that the government works for the American people, not special interests. He acknowledges that these changes will face strong opposition from special interests and their supporters in Congress but emphasizes the importance of preserving the integrity of democracy.
