President Obama sent a letter to Congress requesting authorization for the use of military force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The President emphasized that ISIL poses a threat to the stability of Iraq, Syria, and the broader Middle East, as well as to US national security. He highlighted that ISIL has already caused the deaths of American citizens and poses a potential threat to the US homeland. The President stated that he has directed a comprehensive strategy to degrade and defeat ISIL, which includes airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. While the President believes that he already has the authority to take these actions, he expressed his commitment to working with Congress to pass a bipartisan authorization for the use of military force against ISIL. The President's draft authorization would not permit long-term, large-scale ground combat operations like those in Iraq and Afghanistan, but would allow for ground combat operations in limited circumstances such as rescue operations or special operations against ISIL leadership. The authorization would also cover intelligence collection, sharing, and other forms of assistance to partner forces. The President also expressed his commitment to working with Congress to refine and ultimately repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). He stated that enacting an AUMF specific to the threat posed by ISIL could serve as a model for how to tailor the authorities granted by the 2001 AUMF. The President urged Congress to join him in supporting the nation's security by enacting this legislation.
