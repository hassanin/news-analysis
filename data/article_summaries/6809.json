The Biden-Harris Administration will open a Special Enrollment Period for Americans to sign up for health coverage and reverse attacks on the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and reproductive health care. President Biden will sign two executive actions to restore and strengthen Americans' access to quality, affordable health care. The actions include reopening enrollment to the Health Insurance Marketplace, strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, and protecting women's health. The administration aims to protect and build on the Affordable Care Act, meet the health care needs caused by the pandemic, reduce health care costs, and make the system more equitable. The actions also aim to provide economic security and peace of mind for families. The executive order directs federal agencies to review and reconsider rules and policies that limit access to health care. It also includes a memorandum to protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health care, rescinding the global gag rule and considering the rescinding of regulations under the Title X family planning program.
