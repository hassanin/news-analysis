The White House recently organized a bipartisan panel of scholars and business leaders to discuss the economic case for cracking down on junk fees. The panelists emphasized how deceptive pricing harms competition, increases costs for consumers, and puts companies that price fairly at a disadvantage. Lael Brainard, the Director of the National Economic Council, highlighted the bipartisan support for junk fee regulation and its economic benefits in her opening remarks. The panelists also discussed the prevalence of junk fees in everyday life and the academic research supporting targeted regulation. Additionally, the Council of Economic Advisers published a blog post examining five specific instances of junk fees, showcasing drip pricing and price obfuscation practices.
