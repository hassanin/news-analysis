On December 28, 2016, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation to establish the Bears Ears National Monument in southeastern Utah. The area is home to significant cultural landscapes, including rock art, ancient dwellings, and ceremonial sites that are important to Native American tribes such as the Navajo, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, and Hopi Nation. The proclamation highlights the rich human history of the region, from early Native American occupations to the arrival of Euro-Americans and Mormon settlers. The area is also ecologically diverse, with unique geology, paleontological resources, and a variety of plant and animal species. The proclamation designates approximately 1.35 million acres of federal lands as the Bears Ears National Monument and directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to manage the monument through the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, respectively. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of protecting and restoring the cultural and natural resources of the monument and acknowledges the role of Native American tribes in its management. It also establishes a Bears Ears Commission to provide guidance on the development and implementation of management plans and encourages meaningful tribal participation. The proclamation does not interfere with existing utility, pipeline, or telecommunications facilities, and it recognizes the jurisdiction of the State of Utah and the rights of Indian tribes. The proclamation also addresses issues such as transportation, grazing permits, military overflights, emergency response, and the protection of the monument's features.
