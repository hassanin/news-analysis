The White House strongly condemns the recent attack on Saudi Arabia's Assistant Minister of Interior, Prince Muhammad Bin Nayif. The attack was claimed by Al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula, but it was unsuccessful and Prince Muhammad only sustained minor injuries. The President has expressed his wishes for Prince Muhammad's full recovery and emphasizes the ongoing threat posed by Al-Qa'ida. The importance of strong counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and regional partners is highlighted, as both the President and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia are committed to dismantling Al-Qa'ida and preventing its agenda.
