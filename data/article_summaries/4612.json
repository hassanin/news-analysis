These individuals included law enforcement officers who defended the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and other public servants who have shown exemplary dedication to protecting democracy. The President emphasized the importance of their actions in preserving the peaceful transfer of power and the will of the people. He also highlighted the international repercussions of the attack, stressing the need to defend democracy and protect against voter intimidation and political violence. The President recognized the physical and psychological toll the events of that day have had on law enforcement officials and expressed gratitude to their families. In addition to the law enforcement officers, the Presidential Citizens Medal was awarded to election workers from Georgia, a former Republican Speaker of the House in Arizona, and public servants from Michigan and Pennsylvania who demonstrated integrity and commitment to democratic values. The President commended all the honorees for their service, strength, courage, and patriotism, and called on Americans to remember and defend the democracy that the United States represents.
