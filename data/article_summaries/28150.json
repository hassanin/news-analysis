The article discusses the issue of wartime profiteering and hoarding of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak of the virus has led to unscrupulous brokers, distributors, and intermediaries operating in secondary markets to engage in profiteering and speculation, causing soaring prices and scarcity of PPE such as masks, gloves, and N-95 respirators. This creates challenges for American citizens, including healthcare professionals, who require these materials to protect themselves while battling the virus. Wartime profiteers can purchase domestic supplies, hoard them, and then export them, generating foreign demand and leading to price gouging. The order mentioned in the article aims to prevent hoarding, price gouging, and profiteering by restricting the harmful export of critically needed PPE. However, it does not interfere with the ability of PPE manufacturers to export when it aligns with US policy and national interest.
