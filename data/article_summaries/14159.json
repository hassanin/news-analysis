The United States strongly condemns the acts of violence in Yemen, including the attack on the Presidential Palace compound in Sana'a. They call on all sides to stop the hostilities and peacefully transfer political power as outlined in the GCC-brokered agreement. The US emphasizes that violence cannot resolve the issues facing Yemen, and today's events should not lead to further fighting. They urge all parties to listen to the desires of the Yemeni people, who seek peace, reform, and prosperity. Assistant to the President for Counterterrorism and Homeland Security, John Brennan, expressed concern about the worsening situation in Yemen during meetings in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The United States will continue to work closely with these governments to help end the violence.
