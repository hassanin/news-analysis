President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of California and has ordered Federal aid to support State and local recovery efforts in areas affected by wildfires since October 8, 2017. Federal funding will be available for emergency work in certain counties on a cost-sharing basis, as well as for statewide hazard mitigation measures. William Roche has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are still ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated in the future. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
