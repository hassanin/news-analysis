This article is about Executive Order 13531, which establishes the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The commission is tasked with identifying policies to improve the fiscal situation in the medium term and achieve fiscal sustainability in the long run. The commission will propose recommendations to balance the budget by 2015, excluding interest payments on the debt. It will also propose recommendations to address the growth of entitlement spending and the gap between projected revenues and expenditures of the Federal Government. The commission will vote on the approval of a final report by December 1, 2010, which requires the approval of at least 14 out of 18 members. The commission will terminate 30 days after submitting its final report. The order does not affect the authority of executive departments, agencies, or the head thereof, nor does it create any enforceable rights or benefits.
