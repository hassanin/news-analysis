The United States is closely monitoring the situation in Idlib province, Syria, where millions of innocent civilians are under threat of an imminent attack by the Assad regime, supported by Russia and Iran. President Donald Trump has warned that such an attack would escalate the conflict and endanger hundreds of thousands of lives. The US maintains that if Assad uses chemical weapons again, they and their allies will respond swiftly. They will continue to work with allies to find a diplomatic solution to the hostilities in Syria under the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254.
