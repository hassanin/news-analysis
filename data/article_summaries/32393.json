Second Lady Karen Pence, accompanied by Vice President Pence, had a busy day during their visit to Montenegro. They started by meeting U.S. embassy employees and their families and then took photos with the United States Marines Detachment Unit. Mrs. Pence then visited the Martinovic Honey Farm in Dubovik Village, where she toured the farm, observed the beehives, and learned about honey production. Afterwards, she and Mrs. MarkoviÄ‡, the Prime Minister's wife, went on a scenic boat tour of Lake Skadar in Rijeka Crnojevica, known for its calm waters, beautiful nature views, and bird watching opportunities. They ended the day with a pleasant lunch at the family-owned Poslednja Luka Restaurant before departing for Washington, DC.
