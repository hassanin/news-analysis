President Biden, along with FTC Chair Lina Khan and CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, will announce new measures to tackle junk fees and reduce costs for American consumers. Junk fees are hidden fees that companies add to customer bills, leading to increased costs and limited competition across various industries. Last year, President Biden called on federal agencies, Congress, and private companies to crack down on these fees and provide consumers with transparent pricing. Junk fees cost American families billions of dollars annually and harm consumers, workers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs. Research shows that these fees make it difficult for consumers to compare prices and result in them paying up to twenty percent more. They also hinder fair competition, innovation, and small businesses. The Biden-Harris Administration is taking bold steps to address junk fees and promote competition. The CFPB has already saved consumers billions of dollars through their crackdown on these fees. The White House is emphasizing its comprehensive approach to competition. These actions build upon previous efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to tackle junk fees.
