President Trump delivered remarks in the East Room of the White House to honor Technical Sergeant John Chapman, who was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Chapman, an Air Force Special Tactics Combat Controller, displayed extraordinary heroism and bravery during a mission in Afghanistan in 2002. Despite being critically injured, he fought courageously to save the lives of his fellow servicemembers. President Trump praised Chapman's sacrifice and the sacrifices of all members of the military, thanking them for their dedication to protecting the nation's freedom and safety. Valerie Chapman, John's wife, accepted the Medal of Honor on his behalf.
