The leaders of France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States have released a joint statement expressing their support for the State of Israel and condemning the terrorist actions of Hamas. They emphasize that there is no justification for terrorism and highlight the recent atrocities committed by Hamas, including massacres, kidnappings, and hostage-taking. The countries pledge to support Israel in its efforts to defend itself and its people. They also recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and advocate for equal measures of justice and freedom for both Israelis and Palestinians. However, they make it clear that Hamas does not represent these aspirations and only brings more terror and bloodshed. The leaders vow to remain united and coordinated to ensure Israel's ability to defend itself and work towards a peaceful and integrated Middle East region.
