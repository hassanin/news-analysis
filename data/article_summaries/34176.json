The Administration supports the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act of 2018, which aims to consolidate the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and other development-finance programs into a reformed United States International Development Finance Corporation (USDFC). This consolidation is expected to promote private-sector development and economic growth in less-developed countries and advance the foreign policy interests of the United States. The bill, as amended, aligns with the President's National Security Strategy, the Fiscal Year 2019 Budget Request, and the reorganization and reform plan for the creation of a consolidated, reformed Development Finance Institution (DFI) with strong linkages to the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The Administration highlights the important changes made to the BUILD Act since its introduction, which fulfill its goals of aligning development finance with broader foreign policy and development goals, minimizing risk to the taxpayer, ensuring development finance adds to private-sector resources, and increasing efficiency by reducing duplicate efforts in development finance programs.
