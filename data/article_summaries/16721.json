The White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, issued a statement regarding the recent votes in the Senate. Carney emphasized the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together and find common ground on a budget that reduces spending and allows the country to live within its means while also investing in the future. The statement acknowledges the agreement that spending cuts are necessary and mentions that the Democrats have already agreed to meet the Republicans halfway and are willing to do more. However, Carney emphasizes the importance of responsible cuts that do not undermine growth and competitiveness, particularly in areas such as education and research and development. The statement also mentions that President Obama and Vice President Biden had productive discussions with Senators Reid, Durbin, Schumer, and Murray, as well as Speaker Boehner and Minority Leader McConnell. The President and Vice President urged them to come together and find a solution to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year, with a commitment to avoid a government shutdown that could harm the economic recovery.
