Eli Lilly, the largest insulin manufacturer in the US, has announced that they are reducing the prices of their insulin products. They will cap the amount that patients have to pay out of pocket at $35. This move comes in response to the high drug costs faced by American families, which are significantly higher than in other countries. Insulin, which costs less than $10 to produce, has been priced at over $300 for some Americans. This announcement follows a law signed last year to cap insulin costs at $35 for seniors. The hope is that other manufacturers will also lower their prices in response to this move.
