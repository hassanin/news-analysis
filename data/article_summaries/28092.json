The United States and its allies are determined to maintain a strong stance towards North Korea. They are committed to exerting maximum pressure on the Kim regime in order to persuade them to abandon their nuclear program. The US is open to considering all possible actions, and will not change its position until North Korea takes substantial and verifiable steps towards denuclearization.
