In this article, President Barack Obama discusses the release of the Nuclear Posture Review, which outlines the United States' strategy for reducing the role of nuclear weapons in its national security strategy. The review acknowledges that the biggest threat to the US and global security is no longer nuclear attacks between nations, but rather nuclear terrorism by extremist groups and the increasing proliferation of nuclear weapons to more countries. As a result, the US is taking specific steps to reduce the role of nuclear weapons while maintaining a safe and effective deterrent. These steps include prioritizing nuclear non-proliferation and terrorism prevention, increasing funding for efforts to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation, and working with other countries to strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. The US also declares that it will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are in compliance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which serves as an incentive for countries to comply with their non-proliferation obligations. The US also commits to not conducting nuclear tests and seeks ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Additionally, the US will not develop new nuclear warheads or seek new military missions or functions for nuclear weapons. The article emphasizes the US's commitment to the security of its allies and partners, and its efforts to promote a future without nuclear weapons through the reduction of arsenals, secure storage of vulnerable nuclear materials, and the strengthening of the NPT.
