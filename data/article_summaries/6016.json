President Mohamed bin Zayed has announced the ALTERRA Fund, a $30 billion climate finance vehicle aimed at mobilizing investment to combat the global climate crisis. The fund will support the clean energy transition and enhance resilience, with $5 billion focused on making it easier to invest in least developed countries and small island developing states. This initiative reflects the common commitment between the United States and UAE to broaden clean energy investments and reduce emissions globally, as established through their Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy.
