The Senate has confirmed nominees to the Federal Reserve, a move that aligns with the goal of tackling inflation. President is grateful for the confirmation of Jerome Powell, Dr. Lisa Cook, and Dr. Philip Jefferson, who join the recently confirmed Dr. Lael Brainard. These members bring the necessary skills and knowledge to address the current economic challenges. However, there is still more work to be done, and the President urges the Senate to quickly confirm Michael Barr as the nominee for Vice Chair for Supervision.
