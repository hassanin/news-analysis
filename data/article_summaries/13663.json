The White House has released a Presidential Memorandum titled "Establishing a Comprehensive Approach to Expanding Sub-Saharan Africa's Capacity for Trade and Investment." The memorandum outlines the importance of boosting economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa through trade and investment. It highlights the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) as a key trade relationship between the United States and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the memorandum also states that AGOA alone is not enough to promote transformative growth in trade and investment. Therefore, a comprehensive, coordinated trade and investment capacity-building approach is needed. In 2013, the Trade Africa initiative was launched to encourage greater regional integration and increase trade and investment between the United States and Sub-Saharan Africa. The memorandum establishes a Steering Group on Africa Trade and Investment Capacity Building to coordinate efforts among various government agencies and departments. The Steering Group is tasked with providing recommendations on a comprehensive approach to expanding trade and investment in Sub-Saharan Africa, taking into account goals, benchmarks, and funding constraints. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of consultation with stakeholders and coordination with other government initiatives focused on Africa.
