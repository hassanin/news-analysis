The White House has published a message from President Barack Obama stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq will continue beyond May 22, 2009. The President has determined that obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the maintenance of peace and security, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq still pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. As a result, the measures taken to deal with this national emergency will remain in effect.
