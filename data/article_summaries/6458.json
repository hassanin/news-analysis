President Joe Biden signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act into law, making lynching a federal hate crime for the first time in American history. Vice President Kamala Harris, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and other members of Congress were present at the bill signing. Biden expressed gratitude to the civil rights leaders and the family of Emmett Till and Ida B. Wells for their perseverance in advocating for the legislation. He highlighted the importance of the law in addressing the history of lynching and the ongoing issue of racial hatred in America. Biden also mentioned Bryan Stevenson's research on lynching and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama. He recounted the story of Emmett Till, whose brutal murder helped catalyze the Civil Rights Movement. Biden emphasized that the law is not just about the past, but also about addressing present and future racial hatred. He quoted Ida B. Wells, saying, "The way to right wrongs is to turn the light of truth upon the wrongs." Michelle Duster, the great-granddaughter of Ida B. Wells, was present and spoke at the event.
