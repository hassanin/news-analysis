President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed April 2021 as National Financial Capability Month in the United States. This declaration emphasizes the importance of high-quality financial education in improving Americans' financial capability, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its disproportionate impact on minority and low-income communities. The Financial Literacy and Education Commission, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, is working to coordinate and enhance financial education efforts across federal agencies. These efforts include providing critical assistance and information on various financial challenges faced by American families, such as mortgage forbearance, student loan repayment relief, unemployment assistance, and economic impact payments. Additionally, federal agencies are raising awareness about scams and fraudulent activities that have emerged during the crisis. The proclamation calls for financial educators in government, schools, and private sector organizations to recognize and address the systemic disparities that have hindered financial well-being for underserved communities. It urges all Americans to understand barriers to financial well-being, take action to improve their own financial capability, and assist others in doing so.
