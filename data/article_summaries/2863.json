Panasonic Energy's plan to invest $4 billion and create 4,000 jobs in a lithium-ion battery factory in De Soto, Kansas, is seen as evidence that the Biden-Harris economic strategy to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US is working. Construction of new manufacturing facilities has increased by 116 percent over the last year, and industrial production is at a record high. Since President Biden took office, 574,000 manufacturing jobs have been added, with more jobs created in 2021 than in any year in nearly 30 years. The announcement also highlights the success of the Administration's efforts to create resilient and secure supply chains, particularly in the technologies of the future. The executive order signed in February 2021 initiated a strategy to secure critical supply chains, including electric vehicle batteries and the minerals needed for them. This investment by Panasonic is part of a broader effort to build an American supply chain for lithium-ion batteries, a market dominated by China. The recent joint venture between Stellantis and Samsung to manufacture batteries in Indiana and the funding provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law further support the battery supply chain. President Biden has also authorized investment in the sustainable extraction, processing, and recycling of critical battery minerals. The aim is to ensure that the future of transportation, which is expected to be electric, is built in America with the help of highly skilled American union workers.
