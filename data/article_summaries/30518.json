President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of New York and ordered federal assistance to help with recovery efforts from flooding that occurred between May 2 and August 6, 2017. The federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in the counties of Jefferson, Niagara, Orleans, Oswego, St. Lawrence, and Wayne. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding. Seamus K. Leary has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
