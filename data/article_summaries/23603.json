President Obama has signed an Executive Order to create a Presidential Emergency Board to help resolve a dispute between the Long Island Rail Road Company and its employees. The Board will have 60 days to obtain final settlement offers from both sides and produce a report to the President recommending the most reasonable offer. Although the report is not binding, the party whose offer is not selected will be prohibited from receiving certain benefits if a work stoppage occurs. President Obama has appointed Joshua M. Javits as the Chair of the Board, along with Elizabeth C. Wesman and M. David Vaughn as members. Javits is a self-employed mediator and arbitrator with experience in labor-management disputes. Wesman is a full-time labor and employment arbitrator, and Vaughn is a neutral arbitrator and mediator specializing in labor and employment disputes.
