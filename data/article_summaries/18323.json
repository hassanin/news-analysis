The U.S.-ASEAN Connect is a strategic framework for economic engagement between the U.S. and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It consists of four pillars: Business Connect, Energy Connect, Innovation Connect, and Policy Connect. The initiative aims to strengthen economic ties, increase trade and investment, and support ASEAN's integration efforts. Under each pillar, various activities and programs have been implemented, such as agribusiness credit enhancement, support for renewable energy projects, promotion of innovation and entrepreneurship, and policy and regulatory improvements. Different U.S. government agencies and departments, including USAID, Department of State, Department of Commerce, USTR, Department of Energy, Treasury Department, EXIM Bank, and OPIC, have been involved in delivering programs and providing support in various sectors.
