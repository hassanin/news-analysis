In a teleconference, a senior administration official announced that the United States, along with European allies, will be implementing further economic measures to isolate Russia in response to its ongoing assault on Ukraine. The three main actions include disconnecting sanctioned Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments network, undermining the Russian Central Bank's ability to defend the ruble, and launching a joint task force to hunt down the physical assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs. These measures aim to isolate Russia from the global financial system and the global economy. The official also mentioned that over 30 countries representing more than half of the world's economy have announced sanctions and export controls on Russia, making it a global economic and financial pariah. The impact of these actions is expected to be felt immediately in Russian financial markets. There may be potential carveouts for energy companies in the de-SWIFTing process, but the specific details are still being finalized. China's support in softening the blow of the sanctions is unlikely, as it has been reported that China is restricting some of its banks from providing credit to facilitate energy purchases from Russia.
