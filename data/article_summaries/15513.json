The President's statement acknowledges the centennial of the Meds Yeghern, the mass atrocity that occurred in 1915 where one and a half million Armenians were deported, massacred, and marched to their deaths by the Ottoman Empire. The U.S. Ambassador at the time, Henry Morgenthau, Sr., raised awareness of the atrocities and confronted Ottoman leaders. The statement highlights the bond between the American and Armenian peoples during this time, with ordinary American citizens raising money to support Armenian children and the U.S. Congress chartering the Near East Relief organization to provide humanitarian relief. Thousands of Armenian refugees found new lives in the United States and made significant contributions to their new home. The President emphasizes the importance of historical remembrance and reckoning with the past, stating that a full acknowledgment of the facts is necessary for a more just and tolerant future. The statement also mentions the views expressed by Pope Francis, Turkish and Armenian historians, and others who have shed light on this dark chapter of history. The President concludes by standing with the Armenian people in remembering the lost and committing to learning from this painful legacy to prevent its repetition in the future.
