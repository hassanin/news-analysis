The White House Coronavirus Task Force has recommended 30-day mitigation strategies for New Rochelle, NY, due to the widespread transmission of COVID-19. These strategies aim to minimize the impacts of the virus in the area experiencing community spread. Vice President Mike Pence emphasized the importance of a whole-of-community approach and the partnership between the Task Force and state and local leaders. The Task Force and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have collaborated with New York and other states to develop these strategies. The CDC has teams on the ground working with public health partners to respond to the situation. The cooperation of communities, businesses, and healthcare organizations is essential in implementing extensive community mitigation activities. The recommended strategies include measures to protect individuals and prevent the further spread of the virus. These recommendations are based on guidance from multiple federal agencies, including the CDC, and will be reassessed after 30 days in coordination with local and state public health officials.
