President Obama met with leaders from the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) in the Oval Office. He expressed his condolences for the shooting at Fort Hood and commended the military personnel, first responders, and medical staff who responded to the incident. The President discussed the steps his administration has taken to improve healthcare for veterans, ensure they receive the benefits they deserve, and have access to education and training for re-entering the workforce. He also addressed the issue of mental health and suicide prevention among military and veterans. The VFW leaders raised concerns about the impact of the sequester on Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) services, and the President assured them that VA funding would remain a top priority. He mentioned the progress made in reducing the disability claims backlog and committed to eliminating it by 2015. The VFW leaders asked the President to convey their gratitude to First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden for their support of veterans and military families through the Joining Forces initiative.
