President Biden has been prioritizing the expansion of clean energy technologies to address the climate crisis, lower energy costs for American families, and create union jobs. Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar, battery storage, heat pumps, and electric vehicles are expected to reduce consumer costs, improve public health, enhance energy security, and contribute to the President's goal of reducing emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Recent analysis suggests that the average American family can save an additional $500 annually by using clean electricity sources like solar and heat pumps. The President's National Climate Task Force has established a Distributed Energy Resources Working Group to advance these technologies and ensure that cost-saving opportunities are accessible to all Americans.

To further address the climate crisis, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new partnerships and initiatives aimed at increasing access to local clean energy resources. These initiatives leverage existing programs, funding, and guidance, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to unlock resources and create jobs in the clean energy sector. They also align with the investments proposed in the President's FY 2023 Budget. Additionally, these announcements support the President's Justice40 Initiative, which aims to ensure that at least 40% of the benefits from federal climate and clean energy investments are delivered to disadvantaged communities that face marginalization, lack of services, or pollution burdens.

Overall, these initiatives aim to streamline clean energy resources for Americans, deliver clean energy to underserved communities, and build a clean energy workforce for the future.
