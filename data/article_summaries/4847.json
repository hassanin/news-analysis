The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Office of Public Engagement recently held an event called "Communities in Action: Building a Better Michigan" for state and local elected officials and community leaders from Michigan. Vice President Kamala Harris, Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, and other Biden-Harris Administration officials spoke about the benefits and impact of President Biden's American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act for working families in Michigan. They discussed how the administration will collaborate with states, local governments, labor leaders, businesses, non-profits, and health care leaders to use these investments to create opportunities for working families. This event is part of a series of "Communities in Action" events to showcase the administration's achievements.
