The President met with bipartisan, bicameral leadership of Congress to discuss finding a solution to the fiscal cliff. They agreed to work together to reduce the deficit through a balanced approach of both revenues and spending cuts. While there may be differences in their preferred approaches, they are committed to a constructive process and reaching a conclusion as soon as possible. The President's senior team will continue meetings with Members of Congress and staff while the President is traveling in Asia.
