President Biden is set to announce new actions to combat COVID-19, particularly in light of the emergence of the Omicron variant. The plan aims to provide additional protection to Americans, keep schools and businesses open, and respond quickly to surges during the colder months. The President has already taken steps to restrict travel from countries heavily impacted by the Omicron variant. The US is well-prepared to fight the virus, with a high vaccination rate and authorization for booster shots. The FDA is also reviewing antiviral treatments. The actions announced today will utilize these tools effectively to protect against the Omicron and Delta variants and keep the economy growing.
