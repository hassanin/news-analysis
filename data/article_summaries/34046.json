The Congressional Budget Office's report on the House GOP health bill has caused a lot of controversy, with much focus on predictions about insurance coverage. However, lost in the panic is the fact that the bill represents a significant advance for market principles and limited government, which conservatives typically support. According to the CBO, if their projections are accurate, the bill would be the most significant government reform in decades. It would cut spending by $1.22 trillion, eliminate $883 billion in new taxes, and reduce the deficit by $337 billion. Without reform, the U.S. is headed for a debt crisis, major tax increases, or deep cuts to entitlements. The bill also includes savings of $880 billion in Medicaid over the decade and eliminates almost all ObamaCare tax increases. Conservatives should not discount these benefits, as this is their best opportunity to control the size and scope of the federal government in a generation.
