Former Washington Governor Gary Locke has been nominated by President Barack Obama to serve as Secretary of Commerce. In this role, Locke will focus on promoting economic development in the United States and representing American industry abroad. The nomination comes at a time when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is expected to create three and a half million jobs, with 90% of them being in the private sector. Locke's appointment is seen as crucial in ensuring the prosperity of American workers and businesses, as well as the overall growth of the economy. Locke, who has a strong background in trade and business advocacy, is expected to be a valuable asset to the administration's economic team. Throughout his career, he has worked to break down trade barriers and promote American products internationally. Locke served as Washington's governor for two terms, during which he led successful trade missions to Asia, Mexico, and Europe, significantly increasing the sales of Washington products. He also played a key role in fostering economic relations between China and Washington State, doubling the state's exports to China. Additionally, Locke won a competition to bring Boeing's newest jetliner, the 787, to Washington State, creating thousands of jobs. He also prioritized environmental initiatives, launching the West Coast Governors' Initiative on Climate Change and implementing measures to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Locke holds a bachelor's degree in political science from Yale University and a law degree from Boston University.
