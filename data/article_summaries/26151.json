This article is written by Maximus Ebert, a member of the Summer 2017 White House Internship Program, who reflects on President Trump's promise to not forget the "forgotten men and women" of America. Ebert highlights a roundtable discussion hosted by President Trump with family members who lost loved ones to illegal immigrants. Despite the families' pleas for immigration enforcement, Washington remained silent. Ebert describes witnessing the President's compassion towards these families and his assurance that their voices will no longer be ignored. Ebert concludes by stating that these forgotten individuals are now being heard by the Trump Administration.
