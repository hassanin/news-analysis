President Biden has taken executive action to address the climate crisis and create good-paying union jobs. The executive order establishes a White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy and directs all government agencies to use every tool available to tackle the climate crisis. The order also prioritizes environmental justice and commits 40% of clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities. Additionally, the President plans to double offshore wind production by 2030 and restore scientific integrity across the federal government. The administration is also focused on engaging with Congress and other stakeholders to pass the American Rescue Plan, which includes funding for COVID-19 relief and economic recovery.
