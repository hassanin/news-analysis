President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in Guam due to the impact of Typhoon Mawar. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in the affected areas. The funding will be available to the territory and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, on a cost-sharing basis. The assistance will primarily be directed towards emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation. Benigno B. Ruiz of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations in Guam. Damage assessments are ongoing, and further assistance may be designated once the assessments are complete. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
