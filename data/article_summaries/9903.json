Dr. Jill Biden, along with other officials, has arrived in Kenya to visit the Dadaab Refugee Camps and raise awareness about the urgent need for aid in the Horn of Africa. The region is currently facing the worst drought in 60 years, with famine affecting five regions in Somalia. Thousands of Somalis are fleeing to Kenya and Ethiopia, which are also affected by the drought. Over 12.4 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Dr. Biden will visit the Dadaab Refugee Complex to highlight the crisis and pledge support for relief operations. She will also visit the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) in Nairobi to discuss development efforts and the Obama-Biden Administration's Feed the Future program, which aims to address the root causes of hunger and food insecurity. Dr. Biden will meet with government officials, including President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga, to discuss the best response to the crisis.
