First Lady Michelle Obama has announced that Learning Care Group, a major child care provider, is committing to creating healthier child care environments at 900 schools across the country. They will be implementing nutrition and physical activity standards that align with the Let's Move! Child Care goals in areas such as physical activity, screen time, food and beverages, infant feeding, and parent engagement. This commitment comes in light of the declining obesity rates among low-income preschoolers in several states, including Maryland. Learning Care Group's efforts will play a vital role in reducing obesity prevalence and promoting healthier habits in children from a young age. The organization will be promoting healthy eating, providing physical activity, limiting screen time, and supporting breastfeeding.
