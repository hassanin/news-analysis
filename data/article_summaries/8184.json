Vice President Harris will be meeting with business leaders to discuss how the care provisions in the Build Back Better Agenda can benefit workers, businesses, and the economy. The meeting will include leaders from companies such as Airbnb, Chobani, Etsy, Gap, Microsoft, Patagonia, and Seventh Generation. The Care Can't Wait Coalition has also announced support from over 275 companies for the care provisions in the agenda.

The article emphasizes the importance of a strong care infrastructure for businesses and the economy. When working families don't have the necessary support for childcare and caring for older or disabled relatives, it can lead to care disruptions, lower productivity, increased absenteeism, and higher turnover, all of which negatively impact businesses. The lack of access to family-friendly policies like childcare and paid parental leave has contributed to the decline in women's labor force participation in the United States compared to other OECD countries.

The President's Build Back Better agenda aims to invest in care by making childcare and long-term care accessible and affordable, as well as establishing national paid family and medical leave. These policies are seen as beneficial for both employees and employers and will strengthen the economy as a whole. It is estimated that the President's plan, particularly its investments in the care economy, could increase labor force participation and boost the economy's real GDP growth.

The article highlights the caregiving crisis in the United States, with rising childcare costs and a lack of access to paid leave. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the strain of childcare, with many working parents facing instability and businesses experiencing worker shortages due to childcare issues. Additionally, there are millions of unpaid caregivers who face challenges balancing their caregiving responsibilities with work.

The President's plan aims to address these issues and invest in care so that businesses can compete effectively.
