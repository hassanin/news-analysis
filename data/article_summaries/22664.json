President Obama is requesting the Senate's advice and consent to ratify an Amendment to the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries. The Amendment, adopted in 2007, brings the Convention in line with modern international fisheries governance by revising decision-making and objection rules and introducing a new dispute settlement procedure. The Amendment also includes changes to the budget contribution scheme, which will reduce U.S. annual payments to the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO). The strengthened Convention is supported by federal agencies and stakeholders and aims to improve the management of fish stocks in the Northwest Atlantic and ensure compliance with adopted measures. President Obama recommends that the Senate consider the Amendment favorably and provide its advice and consent for ratification as soon as possible.
