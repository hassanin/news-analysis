President Barack Obama established the Bears Ears National Monument in 2016 to protect the ancestral homeland of Tribal Nations in Utah. The area is culturally significant to several tribes, including the Hopi Tribe, Navajo Nation, Ute Indian Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, and Pueblo of Zuni. The monument contains significant cultural, historical, and archaeological artifacts, such as cliff dwellings, petroglyphs, and ancient roads. It also has unique geology, biology, and paleontology. In 2017, President Donald Trump reduced the size of the monument, leading to legal challenges. President Joe Biden has now restored the original boundaries of the monument to protect its historic and scientific objects. The monument will be jointly managed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, and a Bears Ears Commission will provide guidance on management decisions. Livestock grazing will continue under existing permits, but the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior may retire grazing permits if they deem it necessary.
