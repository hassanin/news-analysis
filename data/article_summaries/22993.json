December 17, 2015, marks the one-year anniversary of President Obama's announcement of an opening between the United States and Cuba. This new approach involves re-establishing diplomatic relations and adjusting regulations to facilitate greater travel, commerce, people-to-people ties, and the free flow of information to, from, and within Cuba. The progress made over the past year includes the removal of Cuba from the State Sponsors of Terrorism List, the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with the opening of embassies in both countries, the establishment of a U.S.-Cuba Bilateral Steering Commission to discuss various issues, advancements in areas such as environment, law enforcement, mail, claims, human rights, global health, travel, commerce, internet and telecommunications, and security of trade and travel flows. The United States also supports the peace talks between the Colombian government and the FARC, which are being hosted by Cuba. The goal is to continue pursuing increased engagement between the two countries and to eventually lift the U.S. embargo on Cuba.
