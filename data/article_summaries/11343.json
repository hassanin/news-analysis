On January 28, 2009, President Obama spoke with Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe and Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear regarding the severe winter storm in their states. He asked for updates on the situation and the status of emergency response efforts. President Obama informed both governors that he would be signing their requests for federal aid and declaring federal emergencies in Arkansas and Kentucky. The President signed the declarations shortly after the calls. The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will coordinate all disaster relief efforts to alleviate the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency. Specific counties in both states are included in the federal emergency declarations. FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide necessary equipment and resources. Emergency protective measures, limited to direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent federal funding. Nancy Ward, Acting Administrator of FEMA, named W. Michael Moore as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in Arkansas and Kim R. Kadesch for recovery operations in Kentucky. For further information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-4600.
