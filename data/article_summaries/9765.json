This article is a Presidential Memorandum from September 2011 written by President Barack Obama. In the memorandum, Obama discusses the economic and political challenges facing the country. He acknowledges that millions of Americans are struggling to find work and make ends meet. He criticizes Washington for prioritizing partisanship and special interests over the needs of the country. 

Obama presents his American Jobs Act as a solution to stimulate the economy and create jobs. The plan includes tax breaks for companies that hire new workers, cuts in payroll taxes for individuals and small businesses, and investments in infrastructure and education. He emphasizes the need for Congress to pay for the jobs bill and reduce the deficit. He proposes a plan that would generate over $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade, including cuts to mandatory programs and savings from drawdowns in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The President calls for everyone to contribute to getting the economy back on track. He argues for a balanced approach that includes tax reform, closing loopholes, and observing the "Buffett Rule" which ensures that millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share of taxes. He recognizes that some of these proposals may not be popular, but stresses that everyone must work together to restore the economy and achieve fiscal stability.

Obama concludes by expressing his faith in the American spirit and the ability of the country to overcome challenges. He calls for unity and a focus on the greater good, asserting that by putting aside partisanship, the United States can once again show the world its greatness.
