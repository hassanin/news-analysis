President Obama is taking action to improve the quality and accountability of Head Start programs. The Department of Health and Human Services will implement new rules that require low-performing Head Start grantees to re-compete for federal funding if they fail to meet rigorous benchmarks. This reform aims to direct taxpayer dollars to programs that provide high-quality services and ensure that children receive the best early education. The new benchmarks measure classroom quality based on a validated evaluation tool. It is estimated that one-third of all grantees will be required to re-compete for funding. Going forward, all Head Start grants will be converted to five-year grants and evaluated every five years. The Obama Administration has also taken additional steps to improve quality in Head Start programs, such as evaluating teacher-child interactions and providing improved training and assistance. Additionally, the administration has initiatives to promote school readiness and strengthen other early learning programs.
