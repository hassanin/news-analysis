President Biden visited Philadelphia International Airport to survey the damage caused by a recent tanker truck explosion on I-95. He expressed solidarity with the people of Philadelphia and pledged federal assistance to rebuild the affected area as quickly as possible. The President commended the collaboration between federal and state officials, as well as the efforts of first responders and workers on site. Immediate emergency funds of $3 million were released, and additional federal funding will be provided in the coming weeks. Pennsylvania has already received $8.9 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including $6.5 billion for transportation projects, which can be allocated to this project. Union crews have been working around the clock to clear debris and begin emergency repairs. The federal government has committed to reimbursing 100% of the initial phase of work and 90% thereafter. The President appointed Mayor Landrieu to lead the infrastructure project and emphasized the importance of this highway not just to Philadelphia but to the entire Northeast Corridor. Efforts are underway to redirect traffic and minimize congestion. President Biden assured that the government will do everything possible to reopen the highway quickly. He concluded by expressing his confidence in the governor's leadership and thanked him for his work.
