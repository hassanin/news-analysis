The article argues that the American Health Care Act (AHCA) is a good start in reforming the federal government's role in the health sector. It highlights that the AHCA moves decision-making to the states, providing funding and flexibility in dealing with preexisting conditions and other insurance protections. It also trusts individuals and families to make their own insurance choices, using health savings accounts and refundable tax credits. The AHCA eliminates many of the Affordable Care Act's tax policies, with only the "Cadillac tax" remaining until 2025. The article acknowledges that there will be additional rulemaking, administrative guidance, and legislative fixes, but concludes that the AHCA is a positive step forward.
