The President also expressed gratitude to the first responders working to protect homes and businesses. He reaffirmed his commitment to providing federal support to the state and local efforts and will stay in contact with local officials and federal partners. Additional resources, such as airtankers, engines, and helicopters, have been deployed to assist with the ongoing firefighting efforts. FEMA has approved Fire Management Assistance Grants for the Yarnell Hill fire, and the President asked the Governor to notify him of any additional resources needed. The President urged residents to follow the instructions of local officials, particularly evacuation orders.
