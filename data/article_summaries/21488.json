Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey announce new round of Iran sanctions and designations. They are adding more entities to the list of sanctioned institutions and individuals who are helping Iran finance nuclear and missile programs and evade international sanctions. The United States is taking these actions to deter other governments and foreign financial institutions from dealing with these entities and supporting Iran's illicit activities. The actions include designating Iran's Post Bank, adding front companies and ship names used by Iran's national maritime carrier to evade sanctions, designating individuals and entities associated with Iran's Revolutionary Guard and nuclear or missile programs, and identifying petroleum, energy, and insurance companies owned or controlled by the Iranian government. The United States will continue to increase financial pressure on Iran and target its support for terrorist organizations and its Revolutionary Guard. The United States is also working with other countries to build international support for sanctions and additional actions to prevent abuse of the global financial system by Iran.
