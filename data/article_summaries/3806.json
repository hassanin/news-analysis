President Joe Biden has signed National Security Memorandum-16 (NSM-16) to strengthen the security and resilience of the United States food and agriculture sector. The memorandum aims to ensure that American families have access to safe and affordable food, that producers can efficiently get their goods to market, and that the food and agricultural system is better prepared for threats that could harm crops, livestock, and the availability of food.

The agriculture, food, and related industries contribute about five percent of the country's GDP, representing over one trillion dollars per year and more than 19 million jobs. However, this critical sector has faced various threats to its security and resilience in recent years.

To address these challenges, NSM-16 designates food and agriculture systems and supply chains as critical infrastructure. It provides presidential guidance to identify and assess the most significant threats, strengthen partnerships to enhance the resilience of the workforce, and enhance preparedness and response. This memorandum supersedes Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 (HSPD-9) issued in 2004.

The NSM outlines a process for the federal government to identify and assess the threats of greatest consequence to the food and agriculture sector. It also aims to strengthen partnerships with the private sector and state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) officials to enhance the resilience of the workforce.

Furthermore, the memorandum positions the federal government to develop and maintain systems and activities that will improve the nation's ability to prepare for and respond to agricultural incidents.

This action by the Biden administration builds upon ongoing efforts by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to strengthen the resilience of the food and agriculture supply chains.
