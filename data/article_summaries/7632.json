The jury has found the three defendants guilty of murdering Ahmaud Arbery. However, despite the verdict, there is still a sense of grief and pain for Ahmaud's family and community. The defense counsel attempted to intimidate and dehumanize Ahmaud with racist tropes, but the jury reached their verdicts despite these tactics. Ahmaud was a son, a brother, and a friend, and his life had meaning. The fight for justice must continue in his honor.
