Senate Republicans voted down a bill to purchase vaccines, boosters, and treatments for the American people. This resulted in consequences such as the program that reimbursed healthcare providers for vaccinating the uninsured ending due to lack of funds. The supply of monoclonal antibodies, which are effective at preventing hospitalizations, will run out by late May. Test manufacturing capacity will also start to decrease by the end of June. This Senate vote is seen as a setback for the country's ability to respond to the virus, and efforts will continue to move this legislation forward with the help of the House and Senate.
