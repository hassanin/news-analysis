The President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities (PCAH) and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts have announced a new partnership to implement Turnaround Arts at the Kennedy Center. Turnaround Arts is an initiative that empowers high-need, low-performing schools with arts programming and resources to address broader school challenges and close the achievement gap. The partnership aligns with the Kennedy Center's legacy of providing arts education programming nationwide. As part of the announcement, the First Lady will host the Turnaround Arts Talent Show at the White House, featuring performances by students and artist mentors. Turnaround Arts has already empowered 27 school districts across 13 states and Washington, DC with arts and music education since 2011.
