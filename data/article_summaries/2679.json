Today marks the 30th anniversary of the Windhoek Declaration, a significant moment for African journalists who came together to advocate for an independent and free press. The declaration emphasized the importance of a free media in the development of democracy and economic growth. This article highlights the courage of journalists who risk their lives to uncover the truth, hold those in power accountable, and demand transparency. During the COVID-19 pandemic, journalists have played a crucial role in keeping the public informed, often at great personal risk. However, the truth is increasingly under attack, with a record number of journalists being imprisoned globally in 2020, and online abuse and harassment of journalists, especially women and journalists of color, on the rise. Authoritarians are attempting to undermine the free press, manipulate information, and spread disinformation. Additionally, the shrinking news industry has led to the creation of "news deserts," areas without local media coverage, worldwide. These attacks pose a threat to democracies everywhere. On World Press Freedom Day, we celebrate the bravery of journalists and recognize the vital role a free press plays in building prosperous and resilient societies. It is crucial for all of us to counter these threats and protect and promote free, independent, and diverse media globally.
