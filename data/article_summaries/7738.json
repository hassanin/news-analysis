Today, Jennifer Klein, the White House Gender Policy Council Director, and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, held a meeting with state legislative leaders from Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada to discuss reproductive rights. The three states have made significant progress in improving reproductive health care and ensuring access to abortion. Colorado recently passed the Reproductive Health Equity Act, which guarantees the right to make reproductive health decisions without government interference. New Mexico repealed a long-standing abortion ban, and Nevada will vote on an Equal Rights Amendment to protect individuals from discrimination. During the meeting, legislators discussed policies to advance women's reproductive health, such as expanding abortion care coverage and protecting doctors and clinics. They also addressed the need to prepare for an expected increase in out-of-state patients seeking abortion services. The senior Administration officials expressed gratitude for the state leaders' efforts and committed to continued collaboration.
