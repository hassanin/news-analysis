This article is a readout of a phone call between President Obama and President Putin of Russia. President Obama emphasized his commitment to a diplomatic solution for the situation in Ukraine, but due to evidence of Russia increasing the provision of heavy weapons to separatists and failing to de-escalate the crisis, the United States announced additional sanctions on Russian individuals and entities. President Obama also expressed concerns about the buildup of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border and called on President Putin to take concrete steps to de-escalate the situation. Both presidents agreed on the need for a peaceful resolution through diplomatic means. During the call, President Putin mentioned the early reports of a downed passenger jet near the Russia-Ukraine border.
