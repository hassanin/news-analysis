The purpose of the summit was to deepen partnerships with Muslim communities around the world, specifically focusing on issues related to education, economic opportunity, science and technology, and health. The summit brought together entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs, and other individuals from various countries to discuss how entrepreneurship can be used to promote economic growth. The agenda included panels on successful entrepreneurship, innovation and technology, access to capital, youth entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, cultural factors related to entrepreneurship, mentoring and giving back, and women entrepreneurs. The summit aimed to catalyze action and create partnerships between governments, private sectors, and foundations to promote entrepreneurship. The participants were selected through a process that involved nominations from embassies and a public application process. The summit was followed by specific announcements of support from the US government, as well as a series of follow-up events and initiatives to continue the momentum.
