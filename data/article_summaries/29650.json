On January 19, 2021, former President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for certain Venezuelans. The memorandum highlights the violations of sovereign freedoms by the autocratic government of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, resulting in a severe humanitarian crisis and the forced migration of approximately five million Venezuelans. The Trump administration had previously imposed sanctions against Maduro and recognized Juan Guaid√≥, the President of the Venezuelan National Assembly, as the interim president of Venezuela.

Considering the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, which poses a national security threat to the United States, the memorandum directs the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to defer the removal of Venezuelan nationals or individuals without nationality who last resided in Venezuela for a period of 18 months. However, there are exceptions to this deferral, including those who voluntarily returned to Venezuela, those who have not continuously resided in the United States since January 20, 2021, and those who are inadmissible or removable under certain sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

The memorandum also authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant employment authorization to those whose removal has been deferred. It concludes by instructing the Secretary of Homeland Security to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
