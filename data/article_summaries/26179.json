During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany addressed several topics. She began by acknowledging the tragic death of George Floyd in Minnesota and confirmed that the President has requested an expedited investigation into the incident. McEnany then announced that the U.S. Small Business Administration, in collaboration with the U.S. Treasury Department, will set aside $10 billion of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program to be lent exclusively to community development financial institutions (CDFIs). 

McEnany also addressed the issue of bias on social media platforms such as Twitter. She criticized Twitter for targeting President Trump and conservatives online while being reluctant to label actions by Chinese officials as misinformation. She highlighted various instances where Twitter allegedly censored the President and his employees but failed to take action against Chinese officials spreading misinformation.

When questioned about the President's tweets and false statements, McEnany defended the President and accused the media of making mistakes and being continually wrong about several issues. She also mentioned the President's concerns about mail-in ballots, citing instances of alleged fraud and arguing that mass mail-in voting can be subject to abuse.

McEnany briefly discussed the President's physical examination, stating that she would inquire about the completion of the second phase and the release of the results. She also mentioned that the President has completed his two-week regimen of hydroxychloroquine and stated that he is feeling "perfect" and would take it again if needed.

Other topics covered during the briefing included the President's offer to mediate between India and China on the border dispute, Russia's actions in Libya, and the upcoming G7 Summit in June.
