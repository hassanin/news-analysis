Former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed has been released from Russian detention and has returned home to his family. The news was shared with Trevor's parents, who expressed their relief and joy at his safe return. The efforts of Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens, U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation John Sullivan, and others in the government were instrumental in securing Trevor's freedom. The negotiations involved difficult decisions, but the administration remains committed to bringing home Americans who are held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. The hope is that Paul Whelan and others will soon be reunited with their loved ones as well.
