First Lady Melania Trump made her fourth annual holiday visit to Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. She continued the tradition of visiting with young patients and their families who are unable to spend the holidays at home. During the visit, she read a holiday-themed story to a small group of socially-distanced patients and their families in the hospital's atrium. The reading was broadcast to the hospital's 325 inpatient rooms so that children and their families could watch from their rooms. Melania Trump also led a holiday-themed round of bingo with the children at Seacrest Studios, which was live-streamed to patient rooms. Following her visit, she expressed gratitude for the opportunity to spread Christmas cheer to the children. The event followed COVID-19 safety protocols, with limited in-person participants, face mask requirements, and social distancing measures. The visit was broadcast to 325 inpatient hospital rooms.
