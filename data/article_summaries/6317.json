Yesterday, the CDC recommended the COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 through 11, following the FDA's authorization last week. This is a significant development in the vaccination campaign, as 28 million young kids are now eligible for vaccination. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices reviewed the latest data from Pfizer on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in this age group before making the recommendation. The vaccine was found to be nearly 91% effective in preventing COVID-19 among children ages 5 to 11 in clinical trials, with mild side effects similar to those seen in adults. The CDC emphasizes the importance of protecting children from severe illness, hospitalizations, and long-term complications of COVID-19. Vaccinating children can also help reduce disruptions in in-person learning and activities. The CDC urges parents to seek information from trusted sources and encourages pediatricians, school nurses, and pharmacists to provide information and answer questions. The vaccination program for kids ages 5 through 11 will be fully up and running starting the week of November 8th, with approximately 20,000 trusted providers and convenient sites across the country offering vaccinations. Parents can go to Vaccines.gov to search for locations near them offering vaccinations for their children. The federal requirements will follow the CDC guidance, and the definition of "fully vaccinated" remains the same. The federal government is also conducting outreach efforts to provide accurate information to parents and address vaccine hesitancy.
