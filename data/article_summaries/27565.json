President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring May 2020 as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. The proclamation recognizes the significant contributions that Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent have made to various aspects of society, including business, politics, literature, and the arts. It highlights the story of An Wang, a Chinese American who played a pivotal role in the tech revolution as an entrepreneur and innovator. The proclamation also emphasizes the United States' commitment to strengthening relationships with Asian and Pacific partners, mentioning the President's visit to India and the enduring friendship between the two countries. The proclamation acknowledges the contributions of more than 20 million Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent to the nation's economy, security, and culture, particularly those serving in the Armed Forces and as first responders. It encourages all Americans to learn more about Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander heritage and to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
