The White House has released a report on the progress made in response to the Rethink Discipline initiative, which aims to support all students and promote a safe climate in schools. The report highlights the negative outcomes associated with suspension and expulsion, such as adverse effects on personal health, interactions with the criminal justice system, and education. It also emphasizes the disparities in discipline practices, particularly for students of color and students with disabilities. The report outlines various efforts and initiatives launched by the White House, including the Supportive School Discipline Initiative, joint federal policy and legal guidance, and the Rethink Discipline Convening and Public Awareness Campaign. Other initiatives mentioned in the report include resources for superintendents, support for state and local educational leaders, fostering safe and supportive learning environments, addressing implicit bias and discipline disparities in early childhood settings, providing guidance to schools on ensuring equity for students with disabilities, transforming school climate, and promoting best practices for school resource officers. The report also mentions the recent call to end corporal punishment in schools.
