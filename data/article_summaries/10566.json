He praised her for building relationships with both Republicans and Democrats and credited her for progress made on bipartisan budget agreements, preventing a nuclear Iran, and enacting Ex-Im and IMF reforms. The President also mentioned that it is difficult to lose a close advisor and friend, but he is pleased that Amy Rosenbaum will be taking over the position.
