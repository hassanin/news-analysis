The article is a press briefing by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney and Alan Krueger, the Chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. The briefing discusses the impact of middle-class tax hikes on retailers and consumer spending. The report states that if the middle-class tax cuts are not extended, the typical middle-class family with two children would face a $2,200 tax increase, resulting in a $200 billion reduction in consumption. This would reduce GDP growth by 1.4 percentage points. The briefing also touches on other topics such as the fiscal cliff, immigration reform, and the situation in Egypt. The President has not made any decisions on troop levels in Afghanistan or on appointments for key posts. The President remains committed to achieving a balanced approach to deficit reduction and engaging with lawmakers and stakeholders to find a solution.
