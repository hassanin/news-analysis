The Biden Administration is facilitating the air shipment of approximately 1.6 million 8-ounce bottles of Nestlé NAN SupremePro Stage 1 infant formula from Cologne, Germany to Fort Worth, Texas. This delivery is part of Operation Fly Formula, an initiative launched by President Biden to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure its availability in stores. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is facilitating the flight for this shipment.

Last week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that Nestlé can export additional infant formula into the U.S. The company plans to import both standard and specialty infant formulas, including Nestlé NAN SupremePro 1, Nestlé NAN SupremePro 2, Nestlé Health Science Alfamino/Alfamino, Jr., Gerber Good Start Gentle, and Gerber Good Start Extensive HA. In total, Nestlé plans to export around 41 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of formula to the U.S. market.

The Biden Administration has also taken other actions to ensure an adequate supply of safe infant formula. This includes invoking the Defense Production Act, reopening Abbott Nutrition's Sturgis facility through a consent agreement with the FDA, and issuing guidance for major formula manufacturers to import formula that is not currently produced for the U.S. market.

Operation Fly Formula has already shipped 1.5 million bottle equivalents of Nestlé infant formula, and flights are being sourced for an additional 8.3 million bottle equivalents of Bubs Australia and Kendamil infant formula.
