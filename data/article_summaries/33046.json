The first bill, S. 743, known as the "Merrill's Marauders Congressional Gold Medal Act," awards a Congressional gold medal to the soldiers of the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), also known as "Merrill's Marauders," for their bravery and service in the jungles of Burma during World War II. The second bill, S. 785, called the "Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019," amends various VA authorities to assist veterans in transitioning from military to civilian life, prevent suicide, improve mental health care research and oversight, enhance mental health care staffing, and provide better health care for women veterans. The third bill, S. 2661, known as the "National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020," designates 9-8-8 as the universal telephone number for the national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system.
