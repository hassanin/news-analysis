The Biden Administration has made significant progress in providing COVID-19 treatments to the American public. One of the most effective treatments available is Pfizer's oral antiviral pill, Paxlovid, which has shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by about 90 percent. The U.S. has committed to purchasing 20 million treatment courses of Paxlovid. The administration has worked with Pfizer to accelerate the delivery of these pills, and they are now in ample supply.

The National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan outlines a roadmap for ensuring that these treatments, along with other treatments, are accessible to any American who needs them. Since December 2021, the administration has distributed COVID-19 oral antivirals directly to states, tribes, territories, and community health centers for free. States and territories are responsible for distributing these treatments to healthcare providers, pharmacies, and other locations. Any doctor can prescribe these treatments.

To make these treatments even more accessible, the administration is taking several actions. They are nearly doubling the number of places where oral antivirals are available, allowing all pharmacy partners in the federal antiviral pharmacy program to order free oral antiviral treatments directly from the federal government. They are also launching federally-supported Test-to-Treat sites, which will co-locate testing, medical assessments, and oral antiviral treatments in one convenient location. Additionally, the administration is providing more guidance and tools to healthcare providers to understand and prescribe these treatments, as well as increasing public awareness and education efforts on COVID-19 treatments.

The administration expects that oral antivirals will soon be available in more than 30,000 locations and aims to increase availability to up to 40,000 sites in the coming weeks. However, securing more and better treatments will require additional funding from Congress.
