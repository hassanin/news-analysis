The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet discussing the impact of gender stereotypes in media and toys on children's development and future career choices. The fact sheet emphasizes the need for children to be exposed to diverse role models and taught a variety of skills to pursue their passions without limits. A conference sponsored by the White House Council on Women and Girls, the Department of Education, and the Media, Diversity, & Social Change Initiative at the University of Southern California will address this challenge. Several companies and organizations, including Discovery Communications, FamilyFun magazine, Girls Inc., Girl Scouts, Netflix, Parents magazine, Participant Media, Scholastic, TIME for Kids magazine, and the Toy Industry Association, have committed to taking new action to break down gender stereotypes in toys and media. These actions include on-air reporting on gender in science fields, promoting gender equality and STEM skills through TV programming, raising awareness about gender stereotypes through media literacy activities, publishing articles and hosting webinars on gender stereotyping, commissioning new seasons of a TV series featuring smart and science-skilled girls, distributing STEM discovery kits, promoting a wide range of interests and talents for both girls and boys, launching a social action campaign to promote self-expression and creativity, inspiring students to think critically about gender stereotypes, and featuring stories about breaking gender barriers in a children's magazine. The Toy Industry Association will also devote a session of its annual conference to highlighting gender stereotypes in toys, entertainment, and retail.
