President Biden's Administration is launching Operation Fly Formula, which involves sourcing flights to transport Bubs Australia infant formula from Melbourne, Australia to Los Angeles and Philadelphia. These deliveries will include approximately 320,000 pounds of various Bubs Organic and Goat Milk formulas, equivalent to 5.5 million 8-ounce bottles. The product will be made available through retailers such as Target, Albertsons, Kroger, and Walmart. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed Bubs Australia to export additional infant formula into the U.S. market. The Biden Administration aims to speed up the import process of infant formula through Operation Fly Formula, partnering with several departments to ensure that formula meeting U.S. health and safety standards reaches store shelves faster. By June 26, Operation Fly Formula will have completed 32 flights and imported almost 19 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula. The Biden Administration has also invoked the Defense Production Act, reached a consent agreement with Abbott Nutrition to reopen a facility, and issued FDA guidance to safely import formula that is not currently produced for the U.S. market.
