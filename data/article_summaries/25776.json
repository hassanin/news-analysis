April 25, 2020, marked the 75th Anniversary of the meeting between American and Soviet troops on the Elbe River. This meeting symbolized the decisive defeat of the Nazi regime and was the result of the efforts of many countries under the United Nations Declaration of 1942. It required sacrifices from soldiers, sailors, and citizens in various theaters of war. The contributions of workers and manufacturers on the home front were also crucial in supplying war materials. The "Spirit of the Elbe" represents how countries can set aside differences and cooperate for a greater cause. As we face challenges in the 21st century, we honor the bravery and courage of those who fought together to defeat fascism.
