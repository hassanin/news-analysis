The article discusses the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. This emergency was initially declared in 2004 and has been modified and extended multiple times since then. The actions taken by the Government of Syria, including supporting terrorism, maintaining its occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining stabilization efforts in Iraq, pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The regime's brutality and repression of the Syrian people, who have called for freedom and a representative government, also generate instability in the region. The United States condemns the violence and human rights violations committed by the Assad regime, as well as its Russian and Iranian allies. The US calls for a nationwide ceasefire, the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and a political settlement in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254. The continuation of the national emergency will be reviewed based on the actions of the Government of Syria in the future.
