President Obama has directed the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create the first national policy promoting fuel efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions for medium and heavy-duty trucks. Currently, trucks consume over 2 million barrels of oil per day and emit 20% of the transportation-related greenhouse gas pollution. The President also called for an extension of the National Program for light-duty vehicles and trucks. Additionally, he instructed the Department of Energy to provide greater support for advanced vehicles, including electric vehicles, and for the EPA to reduce non-greenhouse gas pollutants from motor vehicles. The President's announcement aims to reduce dependence on foreign oil, protect the environment, and promote job creation. The EPA and DOT will develop regulatory proposals to achieve these goals with input from various stakeholders, including vehicle manufacturers, workers, and environmental organizations.
