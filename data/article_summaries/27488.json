According to a senior State Department official, nearly a third of the territory reclaimed from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria since 2014 has been won in the past six months due to new policies adopted by the Trump administration. The official stated that steps taken by President Trump, such as delegating decision-making authority to commanders in the field, have "dramatically accelerated" gains against the militants. The Islamic State has been driven out of 45 percent of Raqqa, their de facto Syrian capital, since the launch of an offensive by U.S.-backed local forces two months ago. Additionally, there has been a near-cessation of civilian displacements and the return of displaced civilians to their homes in places previously occupied by the Islamic State.
