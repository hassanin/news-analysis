President Obama has proposed a plan to build a 21st Century Clean Transportation System funded by a new fee paid by oil companies. The plan aims to reduce carbon pollution, strengthen the economy, and create new jobs. Currently, the transportation sector accounts for 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The President's plan would increase investments in clean transportation infrastructure by 50% and reform existing investments to cut oil consumption and carbon pollution. The plan also focuses on developing a more integrated and sustainable transportation sector, expanding transportation options, and integrating new technologies like autonomous vehicles. The President's plan would reduce carbon pollution, strengthen the economy, and make transportation easier for American families. The plan would invest in transit systems, high-speed rail, and modernizing the freight system. It would also reward state and local governments for innovations that lead to smarter, cleaner transportation systems and accelerate the integration of autonomous vehicles and low-carbon technologies. The plan would be funded through a new $10 per barrel fee on oil paid by oil companies, phased in over five years. The fee would incentivize private sector innovation to reduce reliance on oil and invest in clean energy technologies. The plan also utilizes one-time revenues from business tax reform and provides assistance to relieve energy cost burdens for families.
