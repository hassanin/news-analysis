The trucking industry plays a crucial role in the U.S. supply chain and economy, with 72% of goods being shipped by truck. However, the industry has been facing challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including high turnover rates, an aging workforce, and capacity strains. Truck drivers often face long hours away from home and unpaid waiting times. Despite increased wages, employment in some segments is still below pre-pandemic levels. The Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to address these challenges and build a next-generation trucking workforce. They are calling for industry, labor, and government partnerships to improve trucking jobs and provide clear paths to training and employment. The Departments of Transportation and Labor are launching initiatives to expand access to quality driving jobs, accelerate registered apprenticeship programs, address delays in obtaining commercial driver's licenses, and create more opportunities for underrepresented communities. The administration will also work with state partners, labor, training providers, and the trucking industry to advance these efforts. These actions are part of the administration's larger Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force, which aims to address bottlenecks and strengthen the economy's recovery.
