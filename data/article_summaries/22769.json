The White House has released details of its holiday decorations for 2015. The theme is "A Timeless Tradition" and it includes over 62 trees and 70,000 ornaments throughout the White House. Visitors will have the opportunity to share digital messages with service members using iPads set up on the East Landing. The gingerbread house in the State Dining Room weighs close to 500 pounds. The majority of the holiday decor was designed by Rafanelli Events and executed by 89 volunteers. Three rooms were designed by fashion designers Carolina Herrera, Duro Olowu, and Carol Lim and Humberto Leon of Opening Ceremony and KENZO. Only 10% of the design used new products and materials, with the remaining 90% using repurposed ornaments and embellishments.
