President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to address the national security concerns related to the spread of mobile applications developed by Chinese companies in the United States. Specifically, the order targets TikTok, a video-sharing mobile app owned by ByteDance Ltd. The order states that TikTok automatically collects vast amounts of user information, posing a potential threat to Americans' personal and proprietary information. It further highlights concerns about the Chinese Communist Party's access to this data, potential tracking of Federal employees and contractors, blackmail, corporate espionage, censorship, and disinformation campaigns. The order prohibits any transaction with ByteDance Ltd. or its subsidiaries, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, starting 45 days after the date of the order. The Secretary of Commerce will identify the specific transactions subject to this prohibition. The order delegates authority to the Secretary to take necessary actions and directs all departments and agencies to implement the order.
