A recent POLITICO/Morning Consult poll reveals that most voters are against eliminating Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the homeland security agency that some liberal Democrats have called to abolish. Only 25 percent of voters believe that the federal government should get rid of ICE, while 54 percent think it should be kept. Several liberal figures, including potential 2020 presidential candidates such as Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris, have voiced support for eliminating or replacing ICE. However, 40 percent of voters say they would be less likely to vote for a congressional candidate if they supported getting rid of ICE.
