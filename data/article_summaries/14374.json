President Obama has announced a $3.4 billion investment in smart energy grid technology, the largest single energy grid modernization investment in U.S. history. The funds will be used to promote energy-saving choices for consumers, increase efficiency, and foster the growth of renewable energy sources. The investment is part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act and will be matched by industry funding, resulting in a total public-private investment worth over $8 billion. The implementation of smart grid technologies is estimated to reduce electricity use by more than 4 percent by 2030, resulting in significant savings for businesses and consumers. The investment will create tens of thousands of jobs and benefit consumers in 49 states. The funding will be used to empower consumers to save energy and cut utility bills, make electricity distribution and transmission more efficient, integrate and crosscut across different components of a smart grid, and build a smart grid manufacturing industry. The investments will create high-paying career opportunities, leverage private investment, make the grid more reliable, and empower consumers to lower their electricity bills. The investment will also help the country transition to using 20 percent or more of renewable energy sources by 2020 and reduce peak electricity demand, resulting in significant cost savings.
