On Emmett Till's 82nd birthday, President Joe Biden signed a proclamation designating the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument in both Illinois and Mississippi. The monument honors the memory of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African American boy who was brutally murdered in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white woman. Till's mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, insisted on an open casket for his funeral, allowing the world to see the horrific violence inflicted upon her son and sparking a nationwide reckoning with racism and violence. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of learning and remembering the full history of the United States, including its painful chapters, in order to heal, seek justice, and progress towards a more perfect union. President Biden also highlights the critical work that still needs to be done to achieve racial justice and equality. The signing of the proclamation took place in the Indian Treaty Room of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with several members of Congress, including Vice President Kamala Harris, in attendance.
