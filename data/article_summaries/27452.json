The Council of Economic Advisers has released a report discussing the opportunity costs of socialism on the macro economy, standards of living, and the impact on the Federal budget. The report examines socialism's historic visions and intents, its economic features, its impact on economic performance, and its relationship with recent policy proposals in the United States. It argues that socialist policies provide little material incentive for production and innovation, and by distributing goods and services for free, they prevent prices from revealing important information about costs and consumer needs. The report highlights examples of socialist regimes, such as Maoist China, Cuba, and the USSR, which resulted in less food production and millions of deaths by starvation. It also suggests that highly socialist policies, like those in Venezuela, would reduce real GDP by at least 40% in the long run. The report argues that even the Nordic countries, often cited as socialist success stories, have lower living standards compared to the United States. It concludes that adopting socialist policies similar to those of the Nordic countries in the 1970s would lead to a decline in real GDP by at least 19%. The report also analyzes the "Medicare for All" proposal and suggests that it would require significant cuts in the Federal budget or higher taxes, leading to a decline in GDP and reduced longevity and health.
