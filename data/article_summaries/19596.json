President Obama has signed an Executive Order and released a National Strategy to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Executive Order establishes a Task Force and a Presidential Advisory Council to address antibiotic resistance. It also improves antibiotic stewardship, strengthens national surveillance efforts, promotes the development of new antibiotics and diagnostics, and strengthens international cooperation. The National Strategy outlines five goals to be achieved by 2020, including slowing the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria and advancing the development of rapid diagnostic tests. Additionally, a $20 million prize has been announced to facilitate the development of rapid diagnostic tests for highly resistant bacterial infections.
