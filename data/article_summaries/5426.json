The Biden-Harris administration and several companies have announced major investments to expand the domestic critical minerals supply chain in order to break dependence on China and promote sustainable practices. Critical minerals, such as rare earth elements, lithium, and cobalt, are crucial for various modern technologies and are key inputs in clean energy technologies like batteries, electric vehicles, wind turbines, and solar panels. The global demand for these minerals is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades, and the U.S. currently relies heavily on foreign sources, with China controlling a significant portion of the market. 

One year ago, the administration issued Executive Order 14017, which called for a review of vulnerabilities in the critical mineral supply chain. A supply chain assessment released in June highlighted the national and economic security threats posed by over-reliance on foreign sources. The assessment recommended diversifying sustainable sources, as well as expanding domestic mining, production, processing, and recycling of critical minerals. The focus is on ensuring strong labor, environmental, and environmental justice standards, as well as community engagement and Tribal consultation. 

President Biden will meet with various stakeholders to announce major investments in domestic production of critical minerals, aiming to benefit the community and create good-paying, union jobs in sustainable production. Several major companies have also committed to domestic sourcing of critical minerals. The administration has been taking action across the federal government to secure reliable and sustainable supplies of critical minerals while upholding labor, environmental, and equity priorities.
