On November 13, 2013, the President signed H.R. 2094, known as the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act," into law. This act includes a funding preference for states that require schools to maintain an epinephrine supply and have trained personnel who can administer it as needed. The purpose of the law is to ensure that schools are prepared to respond to asthma-related emergencies by having the necessary medication and personnel available.
