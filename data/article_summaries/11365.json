The President of the United States commends the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) for signing an agreement to reduce tensions in Abyei and allow UN peacekeepers into the region. However, the President urges both parties to agree to an immediate cease-fire in Southern Kordofan. Under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, both parties committed to resolving their differences peacefully and have a responsibility to end the current violence and provide humanitarian aid to those affected. The situation in Southern Kordofan is dire, with reports of attacks based on ethnicity. The United States condemns all acts of violence, including the Sudanese Armed Forces' aerial bombardment of civilians and harassment of UN peacekeepers. Without a cease-fire and political negotiations, Sudan's isolation in the international community will deepen. It is crucial for both sides to commit to peace and provide immediate assistance to civilians affected by the conflict.
