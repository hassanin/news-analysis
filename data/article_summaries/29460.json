President Trump has signed an Executive Order aimed at reforming government regulation by requiring every agency to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force to eliminate red tape. The goal is to address the costly regulations and job-stifling bureaucratic red tape that have hindered the American economy for too long. The regulations from the previous administration cost American taxpayers $873 billion, and the Obama Administration alone finalized over 3,000 regulations. President Trump is committed to reducing the regulatory burden on everyday Americans and their businesses.
