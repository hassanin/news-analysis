President Donald J. Trump's nominees have been confirmed at a historically low rate, with only 51% of his nominees being confirmed as of February 20, 2018. This is in stark contrast to the confirmation rates of previous presidents such as Obama, George W. Bush, Clinton, and George H.W. Bush. Senate Democrats are being blamed for obstructing the confirmation process by forcing cloture votes, which require 30 hours of debate time on the Senate floor. Even non-controversial nominees have been subject to this tactic, causing delays in the work of Congress. The abuse of the Senate blue slip tradition regarding judicial nominees has also forced Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley to hold hearings without the support of both state Senators.
