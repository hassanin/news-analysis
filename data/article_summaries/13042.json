President Barack Obama issued a proclamation declaring December 17, 2012, as Wright Brothers Day. The proclamation recognizes the achievements of Wilbur and Orville Wright, who achieved powered flight for 12 seconds in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The Wright brothers' determination and entrepreneurial spirit have inspired generations of Americans. Their innovation helped shape America's rise as an economic superpower and served as an example for the businesses and industries that built the middle class. The proclamation encourages Americans to carry on the Wright brothers' legacy by taking on new challenges with tenacity and courage. Wright Brothers Day is observed annually on December 17, as designated by a joint resolution of Congress in 1963.
