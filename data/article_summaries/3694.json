On March 3, 2022, the President signed H.R. 4445, known as the "Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021," into law. This legislation invalidates arbitration agreements that prevent individuals from filing lawsuits in court regarding sexual assault or sexual harassment. The law gives the party alleging such conduct the option to pursue legal action instead of being bound by a predispute arbitration agreement. The President expressed gratitude to Representatives Bustos, Griffith, and Jayapal, as well as Senators Gillibrand, Graham, Durbin, and other leaders involved in passing this bill.
