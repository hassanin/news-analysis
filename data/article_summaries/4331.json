During National Adoption Month, President Joe Biden emphasizes the importance of every child growing up in a safe and loving family. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges for children in the foster care system, making it difficult for them to navigate their upbringing without stable family connections. To address this, the Biden Administration has implemented the Supporting Foster Youth and Families Through the Pandemic Act, which provides substantial investments to help older adolescents transitioning from the foster care system. The President encourages states to utilize these funds to support older foster youth in various ways. Additionally, President Biden acknowledges the historical injustices and racial bias in the child welfare system, where Black and Native American children are more likely to be removed from their homes, stay in care longer, and less likely to be adopted compared to white children. To rectify this, efforts must be made to keep families together, prevent unnecessary child removal, and support new adoptive families, especially kinship caregivers. Furthermore, support should be extended to families who have already taken in youth, including LGBTQ+ youth, whose needs are often unmet in the foster care system. National Adoption Month celebrates the families formed through adoption, including those from foster care, and expresses gratitude to the professionals and foster families who support them. It also recognizes the strength and resilience of children and youth still waiting to find their forever homes. President Biden proclaims November 2021 as National Adoption Month and urges all Americans to help children and youth in need of permanent homes secure a more promising future with a forever family.
