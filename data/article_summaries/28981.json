President Donald J. Trump has granted full pardons to Dwight Lincoln Hammond, Jr. and his son, Steven Hammond. The Hammonds are cattle ranchers in Oregon who were imprisoned for a fire that spread onto public grazing land. The evidence regarding their responsibility for the fire was conflicting, and they were acquitted on most of the charges. The judge at their original sentencing believed that imposing the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years would be disproportionate to their conduct and imposed lesser sentences. However, the previous administration filed an appeal that resulted in the Hammonds being sentenced to five years in prison, which was deemed unjust. Dwight Hammond, who is 76 years old, has served approximately three years in prison, while Steven Hammond, who is 49, has served approximately four years. They have also paid $400,000 to settle a related civil suit. The Hammonds are respected in their community and have widespread support. President Trump believes that justice is overdue for them and that they deserve these grants of executive clemency.
