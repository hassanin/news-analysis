On January 18, 2021, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to revise and provide additional direction for the establishment of the National Garden of American Heroes. The purpose of the National Garden is to honor and celebrate the heroes of America's past and reflect the country's exceptionalism. The order highlights the recent attacks on America's history and values, with statues of prominent figures being vandalized and toppled. The National Garden aims to counter this by restoring, venerating, and celebrating the monuments of America's founding generation and other significant individuals. The order lists a wide range of individuals who will be honored in the National Garden, including historical figures, artists, athletes, scientists, and civil rights activists. The Secretary of the Interior will identify a suitable site for the National Garden and construction will proceed accordingly. Funding for the establishment and maintenance of the National Garden will be provided by the Secretary of the Interior and the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities. The Task Force for Building and Rebuilding Monuments to American Heroes will publish an annual public report on the progress of establishing the National Garden and building statues of American heroes. The executive order concludes with general provisions, stating that it does not impair existing authorities or create any enforceable rights or benefits.
