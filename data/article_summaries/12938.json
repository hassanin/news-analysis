Mark Gallogly, Co-founder and Managing Principal of Centerbridge Partners and a member of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, expressed his support for the American Jobs Act. He believes that the President's focus on jobs is crucial and that smart regulation can create a favorable environment for job creation. Gallogly has observed a strong commitment from the Administration to bring about real change. Executive agencies and independent regulatory commissions are conducting comprehensive reviews of regulations, eliminating or modifying those that are redundant or outdated. The Executive branch is also prioritizing ten permitting projects to pilot streamlined initiatives, while the Department of Interior has redesigned the permitting process for renewable energy projects on federal lands. Additionally, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is working to decrease the backlog of pending applications and speed up the approval process. Gallogly and the Jobs Council's regulatory working group are actively identifying other areas where business processes can be improved within the government. He was encouraged by the President's address on the need to enhance the regulatory process for job creation and looks forward to further collaboration on this issue.
