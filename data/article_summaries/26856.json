The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Ad Council, and the Truth Initiative have released a series of videos focused on preventing young adults from misusing or abusing opioids. The videos tell the stories of four young adults who went to extreme lengths to maintain their prescription opioid addiction. The campaign aims to raise awareness about the highly addictive nature of opioids and the risks associated with their misuse. Opioid addiction can take hold in as little as five days. In 2016, over 63,000 Americans died of a drug overdose, with more than 2 million suffering from opioid misuse. President Trump has made combating the opioid crisis a priority, declaring it a nationwide Public Health Emergency and unveiling an initiative to stop opioid abuse. The initiative focuses on prevention, treatment, and reducing the drug supply and demand. This campaign is the first step in raising awareness about the epidemic.
