President Trump welcomed a bipartisan group of Democrats and Republican lawmakers to the White House to discuss tax reform, infrastructure investment, healthcare, and immigration. The President emphasized the need for tax reform that is pro-jobs, pro-growth, pro-family, and pro-American. He also mentioned the importance of bringing back trillions of dollars held overseas by companies. The President expressed his desire to solve the DACA issue and other immigration problems in a bipartisan fashion. He also mentioned having dinner with Senator Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to continue discussions. The President acknowledged that some conservatives may be skeptical of the new approach with Democrats, but he believes that bipartisan collaboration can be successful. He mentioned that a 15 percent corporate tax rate is being considered, as it would help the US compete with other countries. The President stated that the focus of the tax plan is on the middle class and job creation, not on benefiting the wealthy.
