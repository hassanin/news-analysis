President Biden has issued the first United States Strategy on Countering Corruption to address the threat transnational corruption poses to national security. The strategy is organized into five pillars, which include modernizing and coordinating efforts to fight corruption, curbing illicit finance, holding corrupt actors accountable, preserving and strengthening the multilateral anti-corruption architecture, and improving diplomatic engagement and leveraging foreign assistance. Under each pillar, specific actions have been taken, such as aligning government authorities and policies, addressing vulnerabilities in financial systems, holding corrupt actors accountable through sanctions and enforcement actions, forging alliances with like-minded governments, and scaling up assistance and diplomacy to fortify foreign governments against corruption. Looking ahead, the strategy will involve further actions to integrate resources, enhance transparency in the U.S. real estate sector, assess illicit finance risks, strengthen coordination with international partners and civil society, support updated anti-corruption standards, and advance initiatives like the Blue Dot Network.
