In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims May 2014 as National Mental Health Awareness Month. He acknowledges that despite progress in understanding mental illness, many people still suffer in silence. He highlights the prevalence of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder among Americans. The President emphasizes the importance of increasing access to treatment and ensuring that those struggling with mental illness know they are not alone. He mentions that one in five adults will experience a mental illness in a year, but less than half will receive treatment, which he deems unacceptable.

The President also discusses investments in programs promoting mental health among young people and increasing support for veterans' mental health. He emphasizes the need to treat mental illness like any other disease and calls for an open dialogue that encourages support and respect for those struggling with mental illness.
