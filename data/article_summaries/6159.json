President Biden achieved four major wins this week in advancing climate, environmental justice, and conservation goals while lowering energy costs for Americans. The U.S. Postal Service announced a $9.6 billion investment to put 66,000 electric delivery trucks on the roads over the next five years, with plans to acquire only electric vehicles starting in 2026. The Environmental Protection Agency finalized the strongest-ever standards to cut emissions from heavy-duty trucks, which is estimated to result in 18,000 fewer cases of childhood asthma and 1.1 fewer lost school days by 2045. The Department of Energy proposed stronger efficiency standards for light bulbs to conserve energy and save families at least $100 annually. Lastly, an international agreement was reached to collectively commit to conserving at least 30 percent of lands and waters by 2030. Various leaders and organizations have praised these announcements for their positive impact on the environment, public health, and the economy.
