The White House has announced that the United States has submitted its plan for meeting its carbon emissions reduction goal to the United Nations. The plan includes the Clean Power Plan, higher efficiency standards for cars and trucks, improved energy efficiency standards for buildings, and efforts to reduce HFCs and methane emissions. The White House is confident that other countries will follow the US's lead and take action to combat climate change. In regards to the Iran nuclear talks, the White House stated that negotiations could continue into April if progress is being made. However, the White House emphasized that the negotiations need to result in Iran making serious commitments to shutting down every pathway to a nuclear weapon and agreeing to intrusive inspections. If Iran is unwilling to make these commitments, the US will consider other alternatives. The White House also commented on the Indiana religious freedom law, stating that it goes against the values of the country and has resulted in a strong outcry from business leaders and religious groups. The White House supports amending the law to clarify that it does not allow discrimination against gays and lesbians. Finally, the White House has congratulated the people of Nigeria on their recent elections and is hopeful that the new leadership will be able to address the Boko Haram insurgency.
