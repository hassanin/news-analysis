On June 16, 2006, the President of the United States declared a national emergency in response to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other individuals. The declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The actions and policies included undermining Belarus's democratic processes, human rights abuses such as political repression and disappearances, and public corruption. The President has determined that the national emergency must continue beyond June 16, 2021, and has extended it for one year in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
