The Biden Administration has announced that it will facilitate the air shipment of approximately 2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Danone's Nutricia specialized medical infant formula on July 8. These shipments will include Neocate Junior and Neocate Infant DHA/ARA, which are for babies with severe cow's milk or multiple food protein allergies. The formula will be mainly available through medical distributors. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed Danone to export additional infant formula, including Neocate Infant DHA/ARA and Aptamil First Infant Milk Stage 1. Danone plans to export approximately 38 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents into the U.S. market. President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure it reaches families who need it faster. By July 3, Operation Fly Formula will have transported more than 37.2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S. The Biden Administration has also taken other actions, such as invoking the Defense Production Act and issuing FDA guidance, to ensure an adequate supply of safe infant formula for families.
