President Biden will sign three proclamations restoring protections for Bears Ears, Grand Staircase-Escalante, and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts National Monuments. These national monuments had their protections significantly reduced during the previous administration. By restoring these protections, President Biden is fulfilling a key promise to protect America's national parks, monuments, and other protected areas for all time and for all people. This action is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to protect and conserve lands and waters, including those that are sacred to Tribal Nations. The administration has also halted leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, committed to restore protections for the Tongass National Forest, and initiated the process to protect Bristol Bay and its salmon fishery. The administration's conservation efforts are crucial for addressing the climate crisis, protecting public health, promoting wildlife and biodiversity, and rebuilding the economy. President Biden has proposed the creation of a new Civilian Climate Corps and set a national conservation goal. The administration is also supporting locally-led and voluntary conservation efforts and investing in urban parks to ensure equitable access to the outdoors. These actions are consistent with recommendations from Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, who reviewed the previous administration's actions and gathered input from various stakeholders.
