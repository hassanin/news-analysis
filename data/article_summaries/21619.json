The Vice President issued a statement regarding the quarterly reports that will be posted on Recovery.gov by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. These reports will provide more detailed information about the use of Recovery Act funding during the second quarter of 2010. According to preliminary totals, over 750,000 jobs were directly funded by the Recovery Act in the most recent quarter, which is the highest total so far. This reflects the early impact of the surge in projects across the country known as "Recovery Summer." The reports also indicate that these 750,000 jobs were funded by only 17 percent of the funds paid out so far, or about $80 billion. This suggests that the Recovery Act is on-track to create or save 3.5 million jobs by the end of the year. Independent economists Mark Zandi and Alan Blinder have also reported similar findings. While the reports are not perfect or complete, they provide real-time data from the recipients themselves and demonstrate the transparency and accountability of the Recovery Act.
