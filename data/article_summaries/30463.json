On June 6, 2017, the President signed into law the "DHS Stop Asset and Vehicle Excess Act" (also known as the DHS SAVE Act). This law requires the Under Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to oversee and manage vehicle fleets across the department. It also imposes new requirements on DHS components regarding the management of these fleets.
