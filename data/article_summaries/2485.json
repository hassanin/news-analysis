President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, which pertains to Ukraine, is to continue beyond March 6, 2023. The President cites the actions and policies of individuals undermining democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine, as well as the actions of the Russian Federation, including the annexation of Crimea and the use of force in Ukraine, as continuing threats to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
