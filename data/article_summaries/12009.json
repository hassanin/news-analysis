The White House is preparing for the upcoming visit of President Karzai and a delegation of Afghans to the United States. The visit will focus on discussions about the shared goals in Afghanistan and the implementation of the President's strategy. The schedule includes meetings at the State Department, an Oval Office meeting between President Obama and President Karzai, a joint press conference, and a lunch with senior national security team members. The visit will also include visits to Arlington Cemetery and engagements with think tanks in Washington. The White House sees this visit as an important step forward in continuing the partnership with Afghanistan and working towards shared objectives. The visit will provide an opportunity to discuss issues such as corruption and governance, as well as the reintegration and reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan. The White House remains committed to the goal of disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and preventing its capacity to threaten the United States and its allies. The administration believes it is feasible to withdraw troops by July 2011 and that the Afghan security forces are on the right path of training to take over once US troops leave. The visit of Abdullah Abdullah, who is coming to town the same week, is not being hosted by the US government and he is not seeing anyone in an official capacity.
