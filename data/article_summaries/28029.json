In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders discussed the recent progress on the tax reform bill. She highlighted the positive impact the bill will have on American entrepreneurs, workers, and families, and emphasized the need for economic growth to create jobs and raise wages. Sanders also invited Kevin Hassett, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, to discuss the economic benefits of the tax plan. Hassett explained that lower marginal tax rates and corporate tax reform would lead to economic growth and benefit American workers. Sanders addressed questions about the allegations against Senator Al Franken and Roy Moore, stating that the President finds the allegations against Moore troubling and believes it's up to the people of Alabama to determine the outcome of the election. Sanders also faced questions about the President's previous allegations of sexual misconduct, to which she stated that the President denies all allegations. Additionally, Sanders discussed the administration's disaster funding request, the pending AT&T and Time Warner merger, and the recent veto by Russia at the U.N. Security Council regarding the investigation of chemical weapons in Syria. Finally, Sanders responded to questions about the administration's decision to allow the importation of elephant trophies from Zambia and Zimbabwe, and the tax break for corporate jets in the Senate tax bill.
