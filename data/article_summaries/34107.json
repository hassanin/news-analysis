President Trump and his administration applaud the Ninth Circuit decision to uphold the Title X regulation. This regulation ensures that Title X grants are allocated according to Congress's intentions, rather than being directed towards abortion providers or advocacy organizations. Title X prohibits grant funds from going to programs that consider abortion as a method of family planning. The ruling upholds the regulation, which aims to ensure compliance with this law. The President and his administration continue to prioritize pro-life policies.
