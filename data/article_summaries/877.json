The Biden-Harris Administration has released a comprehensive strategy to address the financial risks of climate change. The strategy aims to measure, disclose, manage, and mitigate the systemic risks that climate change poses to American families, businesses, and the economy. It includes actions such as redesigning the NOAA Climate.gov site, proposing rules to safeguard pensions from climate risk, and considering greenhouse gas emissions in procurement decisions. Extreme weather events have already disrupted supply chains and cost Americans billions in damages. The federal government's strategy aims to protect the financial health of households, create good-paying jobs, and ensure long-term economic sustainability. The strategy is built on six pillars, including promoting the resilience of the financial system, protecting life savings and pensions, using federal procurement to address climate risks, and incorporating climate risks into financial management and lending. By taking these steps, the government aims to safeguard savings, create jobs, and mitigate climate-related financial risks for the benefit of workers, families, and businesses.
