President Donald Trump has issued a Presidential Memoranda to the Congress of the United States, outlining his Administration's framework for rebuilding infrastructure in America. The memorandum states that the nation's infrastructure is in a state of disrepair, which is damaging the country's competitiveness and quality of life. Trump urges Congress to pass an infrastructure bill that will stimulate at least $1.5 trillion in new investment over the next 10 years, shorten the project approval process, address rural infrastructure needs, empower state and local authorities, and train the American workforce. The plan aims to address traditional infrastructure needs like roads, bridges, and airports, as well as other areas such as water systems, energy, public lands, and veterans' hospitals. The President believes that these reforms will strengthen the economy, increase competitiveness, reduce costs for American families, and enable the construction of the best infrastructure in the world. Trump expresses his commitment to working with Congress to enact a law that will facilitate the construction of new and efficient infrastructure across the country.
