The White House has announced the launch of an international public-private partnership called Climate Services for Resilient Development. The partnership aims to provide climate services to developing countries that are working to strengthen their national resilience to the impacts of climate change. The partnership has received over $34 million in financial and in-kind contributions from the US government and seven other founding-partner institutions. The Climate Services for Resilient Development partnership will collaborate with local stakeholders and use the resources of various institutions to provide actionable science, data, information, tools, and training to developing countries. The partnership will focus on countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia and will initially work in Colombia, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh. The founding partners of the partnership include the American Red Cross, Asian Development Bank, Esri, Google, Inter-American Development Bank, the Skoll Global Threats Fund, and the UK government. The US government's involvement is led by USAID, with support from NASA, NOAA, USGS, and other agencies. The partnership will leverage existing programs and initiatives in focus countries and build on ongoing efforts to support climate resilience.
