Today, the U.S. government commemorates the one-year anniversary of the sarin nerve gas attack carried out by the Assad regime on the town of Khan Shaykhun. This attack resulted in the deaths of many civilians, including women, children, and men. The U.S. government is committed to seeking justice for the victims and holding the Assad regime accountable for its actions. It also expects all parties involved to fulfill their promise made in 2013 to prevent the Assad regime from using chemical weapons against the Syrian people.
