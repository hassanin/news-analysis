This executive order, issued by President Barack Obama on March 8, 2011, extends the provisions of the International Organizations Immunities Act to the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the International Civilian Office in Kosovo. This means that all privileges, exemptions, and immunities provided by the International Organizations Act will be extended to these offices and their officers and employees. If either of these offices is dissolved, their privileges, exemptions, and immunities will still continue to exist. The extension does not intend to diminish any privileges, exemptions, or immunities that these offices or their officers and employees may have acquired or may acquire by law.
