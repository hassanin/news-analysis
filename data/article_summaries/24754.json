President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Alabama and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred in April 2010. The declaration provides funding for individuals in DeKalb and Marshall Counties, including grants for housing and repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other recovery programs. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. W. Michael Moore has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling FEMA.
