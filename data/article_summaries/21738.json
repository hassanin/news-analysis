In this statement, President Obama discusses the issue of sexual assault in the armed forces and the steps that have been taken to address it. He commends the Pentagon for their efforts but emphasizes the need to do more to support victims and hold perpetrators accountable. The President acknowledges the urgency of eradicating this issue and mentions the reforms proposed in the National Defense Authorization Act. He instructs Secretary Hagel and Chairman Dempsey to continue their efforts and report back to him with a full-scale review of their progress. If the expected progress is not seen, additional reforms will be considered to eliminate sexual assault from the military ranks and protect service members.
