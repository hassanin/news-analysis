President Barack Obama has established the Browns Canyon National Monument in central Colorado's upper Arkansas River valley. The monument encompasses approximately 21,586 acres of rugged granite cliffs, colorful rock outcroppings, and stunning mountain vistas. It is home to a diverse range of plant and animal species, including bighorn sheep, mountain lions, and various bird species. The area also has significant cultural and historical resources, with evidence of human habitation dating back over 10,000 years. The monument will be managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service, and will provide opportunities for recreational activities such as hiking, camping, and fishing.
