The article discusses the recent protests in Iran and the different approaches of President Trump and former President Obama towards the Iranian regime. It highlights that while Obama sought to win over the regime by avoiding confrontation and focusing on the nuclear deal, Trump has distinguished between the regime and the Iranian people, echoing Ronald Reagan's approach towards the Soviet Union. Trump has criticized the regime for stirring up trouble and subjugating its people. The article also mentions that instead of using the money from the nuclear deal to improve the lives of Iranians, Tehran has used it to support troublemaking clients in the region. The protesters in Iran are rejecting this adventurism and demanding a better economy and more opportunities. The article concludes that Trump's rhetorical support for the Iranian people matters and encourages Europeans and Democrats in Congress to join in supporting the protesters.
