This article is a Presidential Memorandum from September 30, 2011, regarding the determination of foreign governments' efforts in combating trafficking in persons. The memorandum states that certain funding will not be provided to Burma, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Zimbabwe until they comply with minimum standards or make significant efforts to do so. Similar determinations are made for Cuba, North Korea, Eritrea, Iran, Madagascar, and Venezuela. However, provision of assistance to Algeria, Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, and Yemen would promote the purposes of the Act or be in the national interest of the United States. Partial waivers are granted for certain programs in Burma, Cuba, Venezuela, and Equatorial Guinea. The memorandum concludes by authorizing the submission of this determination to Congress and its publication in the Federal Register.
