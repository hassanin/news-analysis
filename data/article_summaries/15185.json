President Obama has declared a state of emergency in West Virginia due to severe storms that began on June 29, 2012, and are ongoing. This declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts in order to alleviate the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency. FEMA is authorized to provide assistance for emergency measures to save lives, protect property and public health, and lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in all 55 counties in West Virginia. The agency will also mobilize and provide necessary equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. The federal funding for emergency protective measures will be at 75 percent. Donald L. Keldsen has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
