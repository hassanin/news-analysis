The Biden-Harris Administration released the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism two years ago. Since then, they have increased their understanding of the domestic terrorism threat and improved information sharing with law enforcement and foreign partners. They have also doubled investigations into domestic extremism, prioritized funding for research on factors influencing domestic terrorism, strengthened local prevention efforts, and expanded capabilities to disrupt and prosecute such acts while safeguarding privacy and civil liberties. The administration aims to protect Americans' rights and ensure that domestic terrorism and hate-fueled violence do not interfere with their ability to speak freely, practice their faith, live safely, or exercise other constitutional rights. They are adopting an evidence-based, public health-focused violence prevention approach and focusing on deterring domestic terrorism through investigation and prosecution. Additionally, the administration has launched efforts to prevent and reduce hate crimes, including the United We Stand Summit and initiatives to address antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of bias and discrimination.
