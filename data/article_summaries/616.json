During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was joined by Gene Sperling, the person overseeing the implementation of the American Rescue Plan. Sperling discussed the issue of evictions and the Biden administration's efforts to prevent unnecessary evictions for families affected by the pandemic. He explained that the President has long fought for an eviction moratorium and has supported the CDC in extending the moratorium multiple times. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the CDC could not grant further extensions without clear congressional authorization. Sperling stated that the President has asked state and local governments to extend or pass their own eviction moratoriums to cover the next two months. He also called on departments that provide mortgage-backed lending to extend eviction moratoriums and for landlords with government-backed mortgages to seek Emergency Rental Assistance funding before seeking evictions. Sperling emphasized that the President is committed to doing everything within his power to prevent evictions and that the administration is exploring all options, including legal authority, to achieve this goal. He also highlighted the importance of state and local governments accelerating the distribution of rental assistance funds to help tenants and landlords.
