The article provides data and figures on the reduction of troops in Iraq. When President Obama took office in January 2009, there were 144,000 US soldiers in Iraq. He announced in February 2009 that the combat mission in Iraq would conclude on August 31, 2010, and a transition force of up to 50,000 soldiers would remain to train and advise Iraqi Security Forces. By January 2010, there were 112,000 US soldiers in Iraq, and by May 2010, this number had been reduced to 88,000. The final reduction began in June 2010, with the goal of reaching 50,000 soldiers by the end of August 2010. The mission would then be called Operation New Dawn. According to agreements with the Iraqi government, all US soldiers were scheduled to leave Iraq by the end of 2011. Currently, there are 665,000 Iraqi Security Forces responsible for the security of Iraq. Despite attempts by terrorists, security incidents have been at their lowest since the count began. The reduction of troops does not mean a decrease in the US commitment to Iraq but rather a shift from a military-led commitment to a civilian-led one. The US will continue to support the Iraqi Security Forces and strengthen the alliance in areas such as education, law enforcement, trade, and technology. The article also mentions the reduction of equipment in Iraq and the closure or transfer of military bases. It concludes by providing an overview of the number of US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, showing a decrease in overall numbers due to the reduction in Iraq and an increase in Afghanistan.
