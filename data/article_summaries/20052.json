This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama establishing the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument. The San Gabriel Mountains are located near Los Angeles and provide open space and drinking water for millions of people. The mountains have a rich cultural history, including Native American, Spanish, Mexican, and Euro-American influences. The area is popular for recreation, with hundreds of miles of hiking, motorized, and equestrian trails. The mountains also have significant scientific value, with important research conducted on the geology and astronomy of the region. The proclamation establishes the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, which includes approximately 346,177 acres of land. The management of the monument will be carried out by the Forest Service, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior. The proclamation emphasizes the need to protect the scientific and historic objects in the area, while also allowing for public access and traditional cultural activities. The Secretary of Agriculture will develop a management plan for the monument, which will include regulations for its protection and interpretation. The plan will also address transportation, motor vehicle use, and vegetative management. The proclamation does not affect existing rights, including water rights and grazing permits. It also does not restrict general aviation, commercial, or military aircraft operations. Unauthorized individuals are warned against damaging or removing any features of the monument.
