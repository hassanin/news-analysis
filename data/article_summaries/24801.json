Attorney General Eric Holder announced the formation of the Oil and Gas Price Fraud Working Group, aimed at identifying and addressing cases of fraud and manipulation in the oil and gasoline markets. The group will increase cooperation between the Department of Justice, federal agencies, and state attorneys general to enforce laws against collusion, manipulation, and other forms of wrongdoing. The Working Group will report to the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, which has already been successful in fighting financial fraud. The goal is to protect American consumers from unnecessary financial burdens caused by illegal activity and promote a competitive and fraud-free marketplace.
