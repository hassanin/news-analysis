President Donald J. Trump has issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency to address the threat of unrestricted acquisition or use of bulk-power system electric equipment by foreign adversaries in the United States. The bulk-power system is crucial for national defense, emergency services, critical infrastructure, the economy, and daily life. The Executive Order prohibits certain future transactions involving bulk-power system electric equipment if it is determined that the equipment is designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of foreign adversaries. The Secretary of Energy, in coordination with other agencies, will assess whether a transaction poses an undue risk of sabotage, catastrophic effects on critical infrastructure or the economy, or otherwise poses an unacceptable risk to national security. The Executive Order also establishes a Task Force on Federal Energy Infrastructure Procurement Policies Related to National Security. The President has delegated authority to the Secretary of Energy to implement the Executive Order. All agencies, including the Tennessee Valley Authority, are directed to take appropriate measures to comply with the provisions of the Executive Order.
