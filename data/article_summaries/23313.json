The White House issued a statement expressing regret over Israel's plans to approve additional settlement construction, stating that it is inconsistent with Israel's commitment under the Roadmap. The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued settlement expansion and urges Israel to stop. The statement also mentions that the U.S. is working to create a climate for negotiations and that such actions make it harder to do so. The U.S. appreciates Israel's intent to limit settlement activity and will continue discussing this with them. The U.S. remains committed to Israel's security and believes it can be achieved through comprehensive peace in the region, including a two-state solution with a Palestinian state living peacefully alongside Israel. The ultimate goal is to resume meaningful negotiations as soon as possible.
