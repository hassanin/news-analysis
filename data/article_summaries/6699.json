In honor of National Small Business Week, President Biden is hosting small business award winners at the White House and releasing a report card highlighting the administration's efforts to support small businesses. The report card outlines actions taken, such as distributing pandemic assistance and expanding access to capital. The Council of Economic Advisers is also releasing an analysis on the potential benefits to small businesses from the Investing in America agenda. The report highlights that Americans filed a record number of applications to start new businesses in 2021 and 2022, and that small businesses have created 3.1 million jobs since Biden and Harris took office. The administration has also increased enforcement against tax evasion by big corporations and instituted a corporate minimum tax to level the playing field for small businesses. However, House Republicans recently passed a bill that could jeopardize the small business boom and lead to job losses and a higher risk of recession, according to Moody's Analytics.
