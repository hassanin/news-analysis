President Obama has directed the National Security and Homeland Security Advisors to conduct a 60-day review of the government's cyber security initiatives. The review aims to ensure that these initiatives are integrated, resourced, and coordinated with Congress and the private sector. Melissa Hathaway, who has served as Cyber coordination Executive to the Director of National Intelligence, will lead the review and serve as Acting Senior Director for Cyberspace during this period. The President emphasizes the importance of protecting the nation's critical cyber infrastructure while upholding the rule of law and safeguarding privacy rights and civil liberties.
