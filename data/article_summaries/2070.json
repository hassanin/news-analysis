President Joe Biden has issued an executive order outlining his administration's approach to immigration and asylum policies. The order emphasizes the importance of securing the border while also addressing the humanitarian crisis and root causes of migration. The administration plans to work with civil society, international organizations, and governments in the region to establish a comprehensive strategy for addressing the causes of migration, strengthen asylum systems, and increase opportunities for vulnerable populations to apply for protection closer to home. The order also calls for a review of mechanisms for identifying and processing eligible refugees, enhancing access to visa programs, and restoring and enhancing asylum processing at the border. The order revokes several previous executive orders related to border security and immigration enforcement.
