President Joe Biden has announced new actions to tackle climate change, tap economic opportunity, and emphasize the importance of global efforts. On his first day in office, President Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement and restored U.S. leadership on the world stage. He is committed to combating climate change through urgent and direct action, and believes it is a challenge that must be confronted today. The President has announced the Build Back Better Framework, which is the largest effort to combat climate change in American history. This framework aims to cut greenhouse gas pollution, reduce clean energy costs, create jobs, and advance environmental justice. President Biden is committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, achieving a carbon pollution-free power sector, and reaching a net-zero economy by 2050. He also plans to partner with countries most in need to strengthen their resilience to climate change impacts. The President will launch the President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE) and work with Congress to provide $3 billion in adaptation finance annually. He will also submit the First U.S. Adaptation Communication under the Paris Agreement and release the U.S. Long-Term Strategy to meet the 2050 goal. In addition, President Biden announced the Build Back Better Framework, a $555 billion investment in the clean energy economy, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, which aims to rebuild the economy while accelerating clean energy and transportation.
