This executive order, issued on August 24, 2020, aims to promote economy and efficiency in the planning, acquisition, utilization, and management of Federal space facilities. It includes amendments to Executive Order 12072 (Federal Space Management) and Executive Order 13006 (Locating Federal Facilities on Historic Properties in our Nation's Central Cities).

Amendments to Executive Order 12072 include giving preference to qualified opportunity zones, distressed areas, and centralized community business areas in the process of meeting Federal space needs. The Administrator of General Services is tasked with developing programs to implement the policies of this order through the efficient acquisition, utilization, and disposal of Federally owned and leased space.

Amendments to Executive Order 13006 involve changing the language to refer to distressed communities instead of central cities and reaffirming the commitment to strengthen these communities.

It is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations. This order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
