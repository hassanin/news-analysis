President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in Mississippi and has ordered federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions caused by Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura. This action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts aimed at alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency. FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide necessary equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. The federal funding for emergency protective measures, such as mass care and evacuation support, will be provided at 75 percent. Brett H. Howard has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. For further information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
