The confirmation hearing for Judge Neil Gorsuch to become the next Supreme Court Justice has begun. There has been overwhelming bipartisan support for Gorsuch, with the American Bar Association unanimously rating him as "well-qualified" for the position. Dozens of Gorsuch's former Harvard Law classmates have also endorsed him, stating that he is a highly qualified judge. Gorsuch is being praised as a judge who rules based on the Constitution rather than personal opinions, with the Tampa Bay Times describing him as a "well-qualified conservative." The Washington Post emphasized Gorsuch's reverence for the country's values and legal system. Supporters are encouraged to sign a petition and follow @GorsuchFacts on Twitter for updates on Gorsuch.
