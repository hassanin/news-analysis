The White House is urging the Senate to consider and ratify an extradition treaty between the United States and the Republic of Serbia. The treaty aims to replace an outdated treaty from 1901 and includes provisions for extraditing individuals for offenses such as money laundering and cyber-related crimes. It also prohibits the refusal of extradition based on nationality and includes a modernized "political offense" clause. The treaty incorporates procedural improvements to streamline and expedite the extradition process. President Barack Obama recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the treaty.
