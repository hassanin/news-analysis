President Trump held a meeting in the Cabinet Room to discuss the United States Reciprocal Trade Act. He expressed his concerns about other countries taking advantage of the United States through high tariffs and trade barriers that prevent American products from being sold overseas. The Reciprocal Trade Act would impose the same tariffs on foreign countries as they impose on the United States, with the goal of encouraging other countries to lower their tariffs and trade barriers. The President also discussed the ongoing government shutdown and the need for border security, including a wall, to address issues such as drug trafficking and illegal immigration. He expressed his willingness to support a reasonable agreement to reopen the government, but emphasized the importance of having a wall or barrier to secure the southern border.
