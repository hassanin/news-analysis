The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to engage communities with high numbers of uninsured individuals. The challenge aims to help these communities reach the remaining 10.5 million people eligible for Marketplace coverage who are still uninsured. The Department of Health and Human Services, along with State-based Marketplaces, will publish the number of new Marketplace signups in participating communities at the end of the third open enrollment period. The community that makes the most progress during the challenge will receive recognition, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama. Detroit is one of the 20 communities participating in the challenge. The article also provides information on health insurance coverage in Detroit, stating that 77 percent of people in Michigan can find a plan for $100 or less, and that the average monthly premium for the second-lowest cost silver plans in Detroit will decrease by 2 percent from 2015 to 2016 before tax credits. The article highlights the importance of tax credits, the availability of multiple issuers and plans, and the potential savings for consumers who switch to the lowest-cost plan. It also notes that while progress has been made in reducing the uninsured rate in Michigan, more work is needed to cover the remaining uninsured population.
