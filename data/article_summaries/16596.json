The United States welcomes the agreement reached in Minsk by the OSCE-led Trilateral Contact Group, endorsed by Ukraine, Russia, Germany, and France. The agreement represents a potentially significant step towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and the restoration of its sovereignty. The US calls on all parties to fulfill the commitments made in the agreement and the previous agreements from September. The cease-fire must be implemented and heavy weapons must be withdrawn from the conflict zone. Russia must end its support for the separatists and withdraw its soldiers and military equipment from eastern Ukraine. The US is concerned about the escalation of fighting today, which goes against the spirit of the agreement. The true test of the accord will be its full and unambiguous implementation, including the end of hostilities and the restoration of Ukrainian control over its border with Russia.
