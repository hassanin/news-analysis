The President and G7 leaders have vowed to respond quickly to Russian President Putin's attack on Ukraine. They expressed solidarity with Ukraine and agreed to implement severe sanctions and economic measures against Russia. The G7, representing the world's leading democracies and 50% of the global economy, will impose unprecedented costs on Russia. Putin's actions will result in immediate economic pressure and isolation for Russia, including restrictions on financial systems, global trade, and technology. The leaders also pledged to mitigate any spillover effects and ensure stability in global energy markets. President Biden thanked German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for convening the leaders during this critical time.
