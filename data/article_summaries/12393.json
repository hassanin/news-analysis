During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, Press Secretary Jay Carney discussed a range of topics including the conflict in Syria, the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund, school nutrition, the outing of a CIA officer in Afghanistan, Edward Snowden, immigration reform, and the Nigerian abductions. Carney emphasized the importance of supporting the moderate opposition in Syria as an alternative to both the Assad regime and extremist groups. He also discussed the purpose of the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund, which aims to provide support to partners in countering extremist threats in various parts of the world. Carney expressed the President's support for school nutrition and criticized attempts to undermine progress in this area. He also mentioned that the White House Counsel is looking into the outing of a CIA officer in Afghanistan to ensure it doesn't happen again. Carney stated that the President believes there is an opportunity for comprehensive immigration reform in Congress and hopes the House will take action. However, he didn't speculate on the chances of immigration reform if it doesn't occur by the end of July. Regarding the Nigerian abductions, Carney stated that the U.S. government cannot confirm the Nigerian government's claim that it knows the location of the abducted girls.
