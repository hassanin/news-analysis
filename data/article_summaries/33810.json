The article discusses the Ninth Circuit's decision to block the implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), which allowed the Department of Homeland Security to return over 60,000 aliens to Mexico while their asylum claims were being processed. The administration argues that the decision obstructs the executive branch from executing immigration laws and protecting American citizens. They claim that the MPP has been successful in reducing burdens on US communities and easing the humanitarian crisis at the southern border. If the decision is allowed to stand, they argue that it could lead to a flood of immigration, increased risk of coronavirus entry, strained relationships with Mexico and other regional partners, and a resurgence of the humanitarian and security crisis at the border. The administration is considering legal options to seek further review of the decision and will take all necessary lawful means to prevent the illegal entry of foreign nationals.
