President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring September 11, 2011, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. This day is dedicated to honoring the victims and heroes of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The proclamation encourages Americans to come together in service and volunteerism to strengthen the nation and meet the challenges of the 21st century. It calls for the flag of the United States to be flown at half-staff and for community service activities to be organized in remembrance of those who lost their lives. The proclamation also requests a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, the time when the first plane struck the World Trade Center.
