President Biden made a brief announcement from the Oval Office regarding two executive orders he was about to sign. The first order aims to restore the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid to their pre-Trump administration state, undoing the changes made by the former president. The second order focuses on protecting women's health and reinstating changes made to Title 10 and other measures that made it harder for women to access affordable healthcare related to their reproductive rights. President Biden emphasized the importance of meaningful access to healthcare, particularly during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. He also mentioned the need to pass a COVID relief package before addressing other issues, such as healthcare legislation.
