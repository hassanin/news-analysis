The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit held on December 13, 2022, included the first-ever U.S.-Africa Space Forum. The forum aimed to strengthen the U.S.-Africa space partnership and cooperation in addressing various challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. This includes responding to climate change, biodiversity loss, and global food crises, promoting responsible behavior in outer space, and enhancing scientific and commercial space cooperation between the U.S. and Africa. Nigeria and Rwanda became the first African countries to sign the Artemis Accords, which are a set of principles guiding the next phase of space exploration and reinforcing obligations outlined in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. The private sector also discussed its role in supporting the U.S.-Africa space partnership, with several U.S. companies announcing new investments in this area.
