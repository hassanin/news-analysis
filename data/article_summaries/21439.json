This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama to extend nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Moldova. The proclamation states that the Russian Federation and the Republic of Moldova have been found to be in compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements under the Trade Act of 1974. The extension of this treatment will allow the United States to avail itself of all rights under the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement with respect to these countries. The proclamation also states that certain provisions of previous proclamations and executive orders that are inconsistent with these actions are superseded. The extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of these countries is effective as of the date of the proclamation.
