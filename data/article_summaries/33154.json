The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, held a press briefing to discuss the 2019 budget proposal. He explained that the budget includes two parts: one for 2018 and one for 2019. The budget includes increased spending for defense, infrastructure, border security, opioid crisis, and IT modernization. Mulvaney emphasized that the budget is a messaging document and does not balance in 10 years. He also addressed questions about entitlement cuts, the impact of the tax reform bill, and the proposal for a food box program for SNAP recipients.
