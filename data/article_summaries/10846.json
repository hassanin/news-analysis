This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to North Korea. The national emergency was initially declared in 2008 due to the threat of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. In 2010, the scope of the national emergency was expanded to address the actions and policies of the North Korean government, including the sinking of a South Korean navy ship, nuclear tests, violations of United Nations Security Council Resolutions, and illicit activities in international markets. Additional steps were taken in 2011 to implement import restrictions. The national emergency is being continued because the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States still exists. The continuation of the national emergency has been authorized for one year.
