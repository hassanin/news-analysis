President Biden is traveling to Max S. Hayes High School in Cleveland, Ohio, to announce new protections for workers in multiemployer pension plans. The American Rescue Plan will provide special financial assistance to over 200 multiemployer pension plans, ensuring their solvency through at least 2051. The President will be joined by Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh, Senator Sherrod Brown, ARP Coordinator Gene Sperling, Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb, Representative Shontel Brown, and Representative Marcy Kaptur.

During the press briefing, it was mentioned that there is currently a bipartisan bill in Congress called the Bipartisan Innovation Act that aims to boost private sector investment in semiconductor manufacturing in the US. The bill is supported by mayors, governors, CEOs, manufacturers, and unions across the country, including the Republican Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine. Intel has announced a $20 billion investment in semiconductor factories in Ohio, with the potential to expand to $100 billion if the bill is passed.

The press secretary also addressed questions about the President's efforts to reach out to the family of an Al Jazeera journalist who was detained in Russia and the President's stance on gun reform. She stated that the President has been in close contact with the journalist's family and that he is committed to getting her released. On gun reform, she highlighted the President's leadership on the issue, including signing a bipartisan gun reform bill and his focus on addressing the gun violence epidemic.

There were also questions about the President's visit to Ohio and the absence of certain Democratic candidates. The press secretary emphasized that the President is focused on working for all Americans, regardless of party affiliation, and that his visit to Ohio is aimed at strengthening the economy and providing financial relief to workers. She mentioned that there is ongoing communication with the candidates who couldn't be present.

Regarding the semiconductor legislation, the press secretary stated that the White House is working with Congress on the bill and highlighted its potential benefits for American competitiveness and job creation. However, she did not comment on whether the legislation would be included in a reconciliation package.

Other topics discussed include the President's letter to Brittney Griner, an American detained in Russia, the nomination of a judge in Kentucky, the situation in Ukraine, and the US government's support for Ukraine's recovery and rebuilding efforts after the conflict.
