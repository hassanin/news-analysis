The article is a letter from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, notifying them of his decision to continue the national emergency with respect to Burma. The letter explains that although Burma has made significant progress in areas such as the release of political prisoners and the improvement of labor standards, there are still concerns regarding ongoing conflict and human rights abuses in ethnic minority areas, as well as the role of the military in the country's political and economic activities. Despite these concerns, the United States remains committed to supporting and strengthening Burma's reform efforts.
