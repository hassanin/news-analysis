President Obama has proclaimed December 2012 as Critical Infrastructure Protection and Resilience Month. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of protecting and maintaining the nation's critical infrastructure, which includes physical and virtual assets and systems that are essential to everyday life. The proclamation highlights the need to understand the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure to emerging threats, particularly cyber incidents. The administration continues to prioritize cybersecurity as a national security issue and calls for comprehensive legislation to improve infrastructure security and enhance information sharing between the government and the private sector. The proclamation also acknowledges the physical threats posed by natural disasters and emphasizes the importance of partnerships between federal, state, and local governments, as well as community leaders and the private sector, in modernizing and fortifying critical infrastructure. The proclamation calls on all Americans to play a role in protecting critical infrastructure and directs them to visit www.Ready.gov for more information on how to get involved.
