The article discusses the continuation of a national emergency with respect to export control regulations. On August 17, 2001, President Obama issued Executive Order 13222, declaring a national emergency due to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979. Since the act has not been renewed by Congress, the national emergency must continue beyond August 17, 2015. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
