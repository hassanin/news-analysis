President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed October 2021 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. In his proclamation, he highlights the significance of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was passed 31 years ago and aims to provide liberty, justice, dignity, and equality for all Americans. The ADA has been instrumental in offering opportunities and self-sufficiency for over 60 million disabled Americans, promoting economic participation, and combating workplace discrimination. The Office of Disability Employment Policy, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, plays a crucial role in advancing opportunities for workers with disabilities and addressing emerging challenges such as the long-term effects of COVID-19. Despite progress, people with disabilities, especially women and people of color, still face employment, advancement, and income disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these inequities, particularly for those employed in heavily impacted industries. President Biden's administration is committed to promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility through executive orders and eliminating outdated provisions that allow employers to pay disabled workers less than the minimum wage. The inclusive economic recovery should include young people with disabilities, providing them with fulfilling careers and future prospects. The president emphasizes the importance of tearing down remaining barriers for people with disabilities and ensuring equal employment opportunities for all Americans. The proclamation encourages embracing the talents and skills of workers with disabilities in the national recovery process.
