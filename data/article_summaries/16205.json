President Barack Obama has declared September 2015 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month in the United States. Ovarian cancer is the most deadly of all female reproductive system cancers, with over 14,000 women expected to lose their lives to the disease this year. Additionally, more than 21,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The proclamation aims to raise awareness about ovarian cancer, improve prevention, detection, and treatment, and honor those affected by the disease. The Obama Administration has invested in research to improve early detection and treatment of ovarian cancer and has worked to increase public awareness among women about gynecological cancers. The Affordable Care Act also provides coverage for well-woman visits without copays or deductibles and eliminates annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage, ensuring access to critical care for women. The proclamation calls upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, health care providers, and research institutions to raise ovarian cancer awareness and contribute to improving care for those with the disease.
