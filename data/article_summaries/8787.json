President Joe Biden will award the Medal of Honor to retired Colonel Paris D. Davis for his exceptional bravery and courage during combat operations in Vietnam in 1965. As the commander of an inexperienced South Vietnamese regional raiding force, Captain Davis led his troops against a superior North Vietnamese enemy force. Despite being wounded, he engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat and led a successful counterattack. He also destroyed enemy gun emplacements, captured enemy personnel, and rescued two fellow Americans under heavy enemy fire. Captain Davis continued to coordinate air and artillery support and remained on the battlefield until all members of his company were extracted. He has received numerous other military awards and was inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame in 2019. The Medal of Honor is awarded to individuals who demonstrate exceptional bravery and self-sacrifice above and beyond the call of duty.
