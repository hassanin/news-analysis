The White House has authorized the use of up to $10 million from the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to address the refugee and migration needs resulting from the conflict in northern Mali. The funds will support the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in providing protection and assistance to those fleeing the conflict. Currently, there are almost 230,000 Malian refugees in Algeria, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Niger, with an additional 155,000 internally displaced people. The United States is concerned about the situation in Mali and calls for the restoration of democratically elected civilian governance. They urge the interim government to issue a roadmap for elections and for the military-led National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy to refrain from interfering in political matters. The US also condemns attacks against civilians and the destruction of cultural sites in Timbuktu. They call on rebel groups to disassociate themselves from terrorist organizations and engage in legitimate political negotiations. The United States supports the mediation efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and will continue to consult with regional stakeholders to facilitate the political transition and restore peace and security in Mali.
