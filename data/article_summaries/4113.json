Women's Equality Day is celebrated to acknowledge the progress made in women's rights and to recognize the work that still needs to be done. The ratification of the 19th Amendment, which established that no American's right to vote could be denied based on gender, is commemorated. However, it is important to remember that women of color continued to face discrimination even after this victory. The Voting Rights Act and subsequent measures have aimed to strengthen voting rights and expand access. These efforts have been particularly important for women, who face various challenges such as caregiving responsibilities and barriers caused by voter ID laws. Despite progress, attacks on voting rights persist, disproportionately impacting communities of color, low-income communities, and people with disabilities. The Biden administration is committed to upholding suffragists' promise of equality and ensuring that all Americans have the opportunity to participate fully in society. This includes advocating for gender equality, reproductive rights, access to healthcare, freedom from violence, pay equity, and family-friendly policies. Women's Equality Day serves as a reminder to honor past trailblazers and work towards gender equality and accessible voting for all. President Biden has proclaimed August 26, 2021, as Women's Equality Day and calls upon the people of the United States to celebrate progress and defend the right to vote.
