The White House has issued a notice stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. This emergency was initially declared on March 15, 1995, due to the actions and policies of the Government of Iran posing a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Over the years, additional executive orders have been issued to respond to this threat. The national emergency will continue for another year, as the actions and policies of Iran still pose a significant threat. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
