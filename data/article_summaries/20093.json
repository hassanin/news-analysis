President Obama has announced a new campaign to combat waste and fraud in Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs through the increased use of audits to recover payments. The President believes that Washington often treats taxpayer money as Monopoly money, and this campaign aims to change that. The use of audits to recover payments could recover at least $2 billion over the next three years. The President will sign a presidential memorandum instructing all federal departments and agencies to expand and intensify their use of audits to recover payments. He will also endorse the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act, which would increase the government's ability to fund these specialized audits with recovered payments. The President's proposed healthcare reform includes measures to combat waste, fraud, and abuse, and he is open to using undercover investigations to further combat fraud. The government currently wastes billions of taxpayer dollars on improper payments, and this campaign aims to hold agencies accountable and reduce this waste.
