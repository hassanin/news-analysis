The White House has released a state-by-state analysis of the tax relief measures in President Biden's American Rescue Plan (ARP). The ARP has provided significant benefits for working families and workers by lowering costs. Some key highlights of the ARP include:

1. Expanded Child Tax Credit: The ARP has introduced the largest ever Child Tax Credit, which aims to alleviate child poverty. This credit has contributed to record lows in child poverty.

2. Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit: The ARP has also increased the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without dependent children. This expansion provides additional support for low-income workers.

3. Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit: The ARP has delivered a historic increase in the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. This credit assists working families in meeting the high costs of care.

The White House has provided factsheets for each state and territory, detailing the specific impacts and benefits of these tax relief measures.
