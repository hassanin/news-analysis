The President of the United States, Donald Trump, has issued an Executive Order declaring additional steps to be taken regarding the national emergency concerning the information and communications technology and services supply chain. This order is meant to address the threat posed by applications and other software developed or controlled by Chinese companies. The spread of certain Chinese software applications in the United States is seen as a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. These applications can access and capture large amounts of personal and sensitive information from users. The Executive Order prohibits certain future transactions involving Chinese connected software applications such as Alipay, CamScanner, QQ Wallet, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate, WeChat Pay, and WPS Office. The Secretary of Commerce is directed to evaluate other Chinese connected software applications that may pose a risk and to take appropriate action. The Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence, is also directed to provide a report with recommendations on preventing the sale or transfer of US user data to foreign adversaries. The Secretary has been granted the authority to take necessary actions to implement the Executive Order, and all executive departments and agencies are directed to implement its provisions.
