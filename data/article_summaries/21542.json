First Lady Michelle Obama will be planting the White House Kitchen Garden for the seventh year in a row. The garden was initially planted in 2009 as part of a national conversation about the health and well-being of the nation, which eventually led to Mrs. Obama's Let's Move! initiative. Since its launch in 2010, Let's Move! has brought together various sectors to improve the health of children and families. To mark the fifth anniversary of Let's Move!, Mrs. Obama will announce an interactive map showcasing the impact of the programs across the country. She will also issue a #GimmeFive garden challenge, encouraging Americans to share five things they are doing to lead healthier lives. Children from various Let's Move! programs will participate in the garden planting, including Let's Move! Active Schools, Let's Move! Child Care, Let's Move! Cities, Towns and Counties, Let's Move! Faith and Communities, Let's Move! in Indian Country, Let's Move! Museums and Gardens, Let's Move! Outside, Let's Move! Salad Bars to Schools, Let's Read! Let's Move!, and Chefs Move to Schools. Students from Bancroft Elementary School and Harriet Tubman Elementary School, who have been active participants in the garden since its inception, will also join Mrs. Obama.
