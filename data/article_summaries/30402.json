President Donald J. Trump commends the Senate for passing the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (H.R. 1865). This bipartisan legislation aims to combat human trafficking by enabling federal, state, and local prosecutors to hold websites responsible for facilitating the sale of sex trafficking victims. The President and his Administration have collaborated with Congress, industry experts, and human trafficking survivors to develop a range of initiatives to eliminate modern slavery. The Administration remains dedicated to ensuring that those involved in these heinous crimes are held accountable and will continue to work with relevant stakeholders to eradicate this scourge.
