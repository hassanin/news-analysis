In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims September as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. He acknowledges the ongoing battle against ovarian cancer and the need for effective screening methods and improved treatments. The President encourages women, especially those with a family history of ovarian or breast cancer and those over the age of 55, to protect their health by understanding risk factors and discussing possible symptoms with their healthcare provider. He highlights the efforts of various government agencies, such as the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Defense, in reducing the burden of ovarian cancer through research investments. President Obama also mentions the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which provides support for women living with ovarian cancer by eliminating limits on benefits, creating programs for those denied health insurance due to pre-existing conditions, and ensuring free preventive care for women enrolling in new insurance plans or covered by Medicare or Medicaid. The ACA also prohibits new health plans from dropping coverage if an individual participates in a clinical trial or denying coverage for routine care while enrolled in a trial. The President commends the women fighting this disease, their families and friends, as well as the healthcare providers, researchers, and advocates working to reduce its impact. He calls upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, healthcare providers, and research institutions to raise awareness and continue helping Americans live longer, healthier lives.
