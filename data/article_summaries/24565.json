The White House announced that the United States will provide an additional $339 million in humanitarian aid to support those affected by the ongoing crisis in Syria. This brings the total US funding for humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people to nearly $1.4 billion. The aid will provide food, clean water, shelter, medical care, and relief supplies to over 4.2 million people inside Syria and more than two million refugees across the region. The United States is the largest contributor of humanitarian aid for the Syrian people. The funding will support various United Nations agencies, international and non-governmental organizations, and local Syrian organizations. The aid will also help support the needs of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, and Egypt, including shelter improvements, vocational training, educational classes, and healthcare. The funding will also provide assistance to Palestinians from Syria living in Lebanon and support efforts to mitigate gender-based violence and provide aid to survivors.
