On April 13, 2018, US, French, and British military forces conducted a joint strike on Syrian military facilities related to chemical weapons. This action was in response to the Syrian government's repeated use of chemical weapons, including the attack in Duma on April 7. The goal of the strike was to degrade Syria's ability to carry out further chemical attacks and deter the use and spread of chemical weapons. President Donald Trump directed this action based on his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. Trump states that he will take additional action if necessary to protect national interests. He is providing this report to Congress in accordance with the War Powers Resolution and appreciates their support in this matter.
