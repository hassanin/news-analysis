The White House has released a fact sheet outlining the U.S. response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The U.S. is partnering with the United Nations and other international partners to help the affected countries respond to the crisis. The strategy is based on four key goals: controlling the epidemic at its source, mitigating secondary impacts, engaging a broader global audience, and fortifying global health security infrastructure. The U.S. has dedicated over $175 million to address the crisis and is leveraging the unique capabilities of the U.S. military to provide support in areas such as command and control, logistics, training, and engineering. The U.S. is also implementing a community- and home-based strategy to complement the use of Ebola Treatment Units and is providing resources and training to communities and households to help protect themselves. The U.S. response includes the deployment of specialists from multiple departments and agencies, such as the Departments of State and Health and Human Services, the CDC, USAID, and the Department of Defense. The U.S. is also working closely with the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and other partners. In addition to the response efforts in West Africa, the U.S. has taken steps to fortify against the introduction of Ebola cases into the United States, including enhanced screening processes at ports of entry. The U.S. health care infrastructure is well-equipped to detect and contain the disease if a patient does make it to the U.S. The U.S. is also working on global efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats through initiatives such as the Global Health Security Agenda.
