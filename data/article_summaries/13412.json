The article discusses the launch of the Digital Promise Initiative, a national center created by Congress to advance technologies that can transform teaching and learning. The initiative will work with educators, researchers, technology firms, and entrepreneurs to address three key challenges: identifying breakthrough technologies, learning faster what's working and what's not, and transforming the market for learning technologies. The article also mentions other initiatives being announced with the launch of Digital Promise, such as the creation of a League of Innovative Schools, new investments by NSF on cyber-learning, and the launch of the 2012 National STEM Video Game Challenge. Additionally, leading researchers will work together to determine what works in learning technology, and Valve, a leading video game company, will establish an education prize. The Nature Conservancy and Morgridge Family Foundation will partner to create digital content for kids, and tech firms will provide recommendations and support for Digital Promise.
