President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13664 with respect to South Sudan will continue beyond April 3, 2020. The situation in South Sudan, characterized by activities that threaten peace, security, and stability, including violence, atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
