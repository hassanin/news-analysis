President Donald Trump issued a proclamation declaring October 2020 as National Energy Awareness Month. The proclamation highlights the Trump administration's efforts to reduce regulatory burdens on the American energy sector and promote stronger production of crude oil and other liquids. The administration has also worked to eliminate regulatory obstacles to building major energy infrastructure and has approved projects such as the Keystone XL, Dakota Access, and Mountain Valley Pipelines. As a result, the United States has become a net energy exporter for the first time since 1952 and is the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. The proclamation emphasizes the administration's commitment to promoting robust energy development while also being responsible stewards of the environment. The United States has made significant progress in reducing emissions of common air pollutants and is a world leader in clean air. The proclamation also mentions the Great American Outdoors Act, which directs royalties from energy production on federal lands and waters toward conserving and repairing national parks, forests, refuges, public lands, and tribal schools. The proclamation concludes by recommitting to supporting the nation's energy workers and sustaining energy dominance and independence in the future.
