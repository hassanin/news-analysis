President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu held a meeting in the Oval Office to discuss Mideast peace. They announced that a plan will be revealed the next day, which they believe both Netanyahu and his opponent will like. Trump mentioned that many Arab nations have already agreed to the plan and think it's a positive step towards peace. He acknowledged that it is a challenging deal to make, but he hopes it can be achieved. Netanyahu thanked Trump for his support and called the plan the "opportunity of the century." Trump mentioned that the Palestinians may initially reject the plan but believes they will eventually see its benefits. He also addressed the issue of cutting off aid to the Palestinians. The President stated that the plan will be a suggestion between Israel and the Palestinians and will be the closest they have come to an agreement. He expressed hope for support from all parties involved. The press conference ended with Trump dismissing allegations made by John Bolton as false.
