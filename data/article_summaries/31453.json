On July 9, President Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement. Following the announcement, several senators, former President George W. Bush, members of the House of Representatives, and state and territory officials expressed their support for Kavanaugh's nomination. They praised Kavanaugh's qualifications, judicial record, commitment to the Constitution, and adherence to the rule of law. Various policy and advocacy organizations, such as the 60 Plus Association, Faith & Freedom Coalition, and the National Rifle Association, also backed Kavanaugh's nomination, citing his conservative judicial philosophy and commitment to interpreting the Constitution as written. Media commentators and legal experts have predicted that Kavanaugh's confirmation is likely due to his qualifications and record.
