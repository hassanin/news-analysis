President Biden was asked about his plans to speak with Mitch McConnell on the debt limit, to which he responded that he will be speaking with McConnell. When asked about profane signs, the President said he smiles and gives a thumbs up. On trimming a trillion or more dollars from the package, Biden stated that negotiations are ongoing and his objective is to eventually get everything he campaigned on passed. He mentioned that a compromise will be reached between supporters of infrastructure and human infrastructure, but that doesn't mean it's the end of the package. Means testing will be part of it. When asked about the Hyde Amendment, Biden said it will have to be decided based on the whole package. He also mentioned that the group of moderates he met with earlier are on the same page as him. Biden emphasized that major shifts in the American economy rarely come from a single piece of legislation and that the totality of what gets passed remains to be seen. If McConnell refuses to cooperate, Biden said there aren't many options and that there's not much time left to do it by reconciliation. He expressed confidence in Fed Chair Powell, but stated that he needs to catch up on recent assertions. When asked how he persuaded Senator Manchin to come up on the package, Biden mentioned having many talks and asking Manchin and Sinema to decide what they like in the Build Back Better plan. He also mentioned that they added up what they liked, which resulted in a higher number, but it remains to be seen if they settle on that. Finally, Biden explained that he went to Slotkin's district to be with the engineers and expressed his admiration for her.
