President Obama will host Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore at the White House for an official visit and State Dinner on August 2. The visit will mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Singapore and the United States. The two leaders will celebrate the bilateral relationship between the two countries, which has attracted numerous U.S. companies to establish a presence in Singapore, strengthened security ties between their militaries, and increased exchanges of college students. They will also discuss how their partnership can address international challenges and promote a rules-based order for the Asia-Pacific region.
