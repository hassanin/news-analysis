The article discusses the job growth in the United States since President Trump took office. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nonfarm payroll employment rose by 103,000 in March, bringing the average monthly job growth for 2018 to 202,000. Since Trump's inauguration, more than 2.5 million jobs have been added to the economy, with nearly 3 million added since his election in November 2016. The manufacturing and mining industries have experienced significant job growth, with mining adding 9,000 jobs and manufacturing adding 22,000 jobs in March. However, employment in retail trade and construction declined due to bad weather. The article also highlights the unemployment rate, which has remained steady at 4.1 percent for the past six months, the lowest since December 2000. The unemployment rate has decreased for all major demographic groups, including Americans with disabilities, who have experienced a decline in unemployment rates of 3 percentage points for men and 2.6 percentage points for women since Trump took office. Disabled Americans have also seen stronger employment growth compared to the rest of the labor market since 2017. Overall, the article suggests that the President's pro-growth economic agenda has had positive effects on job creation and unemployment rates.
