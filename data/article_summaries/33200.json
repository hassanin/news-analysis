The White House will be opening its gardens and grounds to visitors on October 19 and 20. Visitors will have the opportunity to explore the South Lawn, Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, Rose Garden, and the White House Kitchen Garden. The event is free and open to the public, but attendees will need to obtain a timed ticket from the National Park Service (NPS) tent near the entry point. Tickets will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis starting at 8:30 AM each day. Certain items are not allowed on the White House grounds, such as aerosols, animals (except service/guide dogs), oversized backpacks and bags, drones, firearms, and more. Strollers, wheelchairs, umbrellas (with no metal tips), and cameras are permitted, as well as any necessary medical items. In case of inclement weather, the event may be canceled, so visitors can call the 24-hour information line to check the status.
