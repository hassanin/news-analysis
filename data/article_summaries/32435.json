The proclamation honors the bravery and sacrifices of those who fought and died in the war. It also acknowledges the ongoing relationship between the United States and South Korea, which is built on respect, economic prosperity, and a commitment to democratic values and peace through strength. The proclamation also mentions the historic summit with Chairman Kim Jong Un in Singapore, which offered hope for the future, including the promise of complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The recovery and repatriation of the remains of Americans missing in action is also highlighted. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor and give thanks to Korean War veterans.
