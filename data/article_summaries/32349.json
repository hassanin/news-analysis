On February 19, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a statement to continue the national emergency with respect to Cuba. The national emergency was initially declared in 1996 and has been modified and expanded over the years. The unauthorized entry of US-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters and the situation in Cuba are seen as a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency will continue for another year. The statement is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
