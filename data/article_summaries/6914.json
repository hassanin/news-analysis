During a trip to Lorain, Ohio, EPA Administrator Michael Regan joined White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre to discuss President Biden's announcement of $1 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to accelerate the cleanup and restoration of environmentally degraded sites in the Great Lakes. The investment aims to address legacy pollution, clean up the environment, ensure clean drinking water, tackle climate change, strengthen resilience to extreme weather, and create good-paying union jobs. Administrator Regan expressed excitement about the investment, stating that it will allow for the cleanup of 22 of the 25 areas of concern along the Great Lakes by 2030. He also discussed the potential closure of remaining U.S. coal plants and the impact of the Supreme Court's decision on the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In response to questions about Russia's actions in Ukraine, Jean-Pierre highlighted the unprovoked expulsion of the deputy chief of mission and the risk of a Russian invasion. She emphasized the importance of diplomacy, the need to watch for false pretexts, and the role of the international community in addressing the crisis. Jean-Pierre also addressed other topics, including the possibility of a government shutdown, infrastructure and economic frameworks in the Indo-Pacific region, Supreme Court nominee interviews, and the President's travel plans.
