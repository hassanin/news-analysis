The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a background press call on the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay. The plan to close the detention facility will be presented to Congress and includes four main elements: continuing to transfer detainees to other countries, conducting periodic reviews of detainees, identifying dispositions for detainees who remain in law of war detention, and working with Congress to find a location in the US to hold detainees that cannot be transferred. The plan does not endorse a specific facility in the US and estimates that it would be cheaper to hold detainees in the US than at Guantanamo Bay. The plan also addresses the legal issues associated with relocating detainees to the US. The administration is urging Congress to work with them on this plan and hopes to have a productive conversation with legislators. The plan does not specify a final date for action, but emphasizes that time is of the essence. The administration believes that the closure of Guantanamo Bay is a national security imperative and that it is time to bring this chapter of American history to a close.
