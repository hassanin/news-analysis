On August 6, 2015, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 876, also known as the "Notice of Observation Treatment and Implication for Care Eligibility (NOTICE) Act," requires hospitals to notify Medicare beneficiaries who are in the hospital for observation that they are classified as outpatients and explains the effects of that classification on their Medicare coverage. 

The second bill, H.R. 1626, known as the "DHS IT Duplication Reduction Act of 2015," mandates the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to identify duplicative or fragmented information technology systems within the department and develop a strategy to reduce such duplication or fragmentation.

The third bill, S. 1482, referred to as the "Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2015," extends exemptions to Federal antitrust law until September 30, 2022. These exemptions allow two or more colleges or universities that admit all students on a need-blind basis to agree to award financial aid to students solely based on demonstrated financial need.
