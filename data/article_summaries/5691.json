The Biden administration is addressing supply chain issues that are causing price increases, particularly in the meat industry. Large corporations in uncompetitive markets are taking advantage of their market power to raise prices and increase their own profit margins. The data from four major meat-processing companies show that their gross profits have increased by over 120% and their net income has surged by 500% since before the pandemic. They have also announced over a billion dollars in new dividends and stock buybacks. Despite claims that rising input costs are driving price increases, the profit margins of these companies have skyrocketed. This suggests that they are using their market power to extract bigger profit margins for themselves. The Biden administration is taking action to promote competition and crack down on illegal price fixing. They are investing in creating more competition in meat-processing, providing relief to small businesses and agricultural workers, and promoting transparency in cattle markets. The Department of Agriculture has also announced a loan guarantee program to invest in small meat processors and distributors, which will expand capacity and bring competition to the industry. These actions aim to support families, farmers, ranchers, and workers, and address the concentration in meat processing that allows dominant corporations to raise prices.
