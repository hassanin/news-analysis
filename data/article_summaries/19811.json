This executive order, issued by President Barack Obama on November 29, 2016, provides for the appointment of alumni from the Fulbright U.S. Student Program, Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program, and Critical Language Scholarship Program to the competitive service. The order states that the federal government benefits from a workforce that can be recruited from a diverse pool of qualified candidates for highly competitive, merit-based positions. Participants in these programs develop advanced language skills and cultural competence in strategically important regions. The order allows the head of any agency in the executive branch to appoint individuals who have successfully participated in these programs, as certified by the Secretary of State or designee, and have passed the required examination by the Office of Personnel Management. The Secretary of State or designee is responsible for issuing certificates to those who have completed the program requirements. Appointments must be made within a year of completing the program, with possible extensions for military service, pursuing higher education, or other activities. Individuals appointed under this order become career conditional employees. Disqualifying criteria for appointment include restrictions on employing non-U.S. citizens, violation of anti-nepotism provisions, failure to register for Selective Service, not meeting occupational standards, or not meeting suitability factors. The Office of Personnel Management is authorized to issue additional regulations as needed. The order does not affect the authority granted to executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. This order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
