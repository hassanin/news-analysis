The article is a letter from President Joseph R. Biden Jr. addressed to the Speaker of the House (or President) regarding the continuation of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894. Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act stipulates that a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and transmits it to Congress within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the declaration. President Biden states that the situation in and in relation to Syria, specifically the actions of the Government of Turkey conducting a military offensive in northeast Syria, undermines the campaign against ISIS, endangers civilians, threatens peace and stability in the region, and poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894.
