The article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama in 2011 regarding the implementation of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) Rule. The MATS Rule aims to control emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants from power plants in order to protect public health and the environment. The rule is expected to have significant health benefits for Americans, especially vulnerable populations. The memorandum emphasizes the need for cost-effective implementation that ensures electric reliability. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) have conducted analyses indicating that the MATS Rule will not compromise electric generating resource adequacy. The Clean Air Act provides flexibility for compliance with the rule, including a 3-year compliance period and the possibility of an additional year if necessary. The EPA is directed to work with state and local permitting authorities to make the additional year broadly available to sources and to promote early planning and execution of measures to implement the rule while maintaining electric reliability. The memorandum also calls for the public dissemination of information regarding the use of authorities under the Clean Air Act to address any need for additional time to comply with the rule.
