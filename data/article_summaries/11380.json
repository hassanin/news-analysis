The United States and the European Union, along with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), recognize the importance of nuclear security and their shared responsibility to prevent, detect, and respond to the trafficking of nuclear or radioactive materials. In line with the Nuclear Security Summit's focus on combating illicit trafficking, they have taken initial steps to address this issue. This includes the collaboration of various organizations to conduct the Illicit Trafficking Radiation Assessment Program (ITRAP+10) test campaign, which evaluated different detection and identification equipment against international standards. The findings of this campaign will be shared to inform future revisions to nuclear security standards, and scientific and technical data on detection systems will be made available to promote research and development efforts.
