The law in question is 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), which gives presidents wide latitude over who can come into the country. The article mentions that presidents such as Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush have used this law to ban certain groups of foreigners in the past. It also mentions that President Obama had banned immigrants who had committed or participated in war crimes, crimes against humanity, and violations of human rights. The article concludes by stating that the White House argues that Trump's executive order is well within his authority and that the law is on the president's side.
