On October 5, 2018, the President signed into law H.R. 302, the "FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018." This act reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration and related revenue authorities until September 30, 2023. It also modifies the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster assistance authorities and provides $1.68 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund for long-term disaster recovery. Additionally, the act further integrates unmanned aircraft systems into the nation's airspace systems and establishes a United States International Development Finance Corporation.
