The Obama Administration has unveiled a "Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights" as part of an effort to improve privacy protections for consumers online. The blueprint aims to give users more control over how their personal information is used on the internet and to help businesses maintain consumer trust in the digital environment. The Commerce Department will work with companies, privacy advocates, and other stakeholders to develop and enforce privacy policies based on the Bill of Rights. Additionally, leading internet companies and advertising networks have committed to implementing "Do Not Track" technology, allowing users to control online tracking. The advertising industry has also pledged not to release consumers' browsing data for purposes other than advertising. The Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights includes rights such as individual control, transparency, respect for context, security, access and accuracy, focused collection, and accountability. The administration plans to work with Congress to develop legislation based on these rights to extend privacy protections to sectors that existing laws do not cover. This initiative comes after a comprehensive review of privacy policy and innovation in the internet economy.
