President Biden has signed a new Executive Order (E.O.) that strengthens U.S. sanctions against financial facilitators of Russia's military activities. The E.O. warns foreign financial institutions that they risk losing access to the U.S. financial system if they facilitate significant transactions related to Russia's military industrial base. It also allows for the expansion of U.S. import bans on certain Russian goods. The Biden Administration has been actively working with allies and partners to hold Russia accountable for its aggression towards Ukraine. The United States has imposed sanctions on thousands of entities and individuals, including multinational procurement networks used by Russia. To counter evasion of these measures, the Biden Administration has coordinated with partners to target companies in third countries and engage with foreign governments, companies, and financial institutions to share information and highlight sanctions risks. The new E.O. provides additional tools to root out Russia's procurement networks and makes it more difficult for specific Russian goods, such as diamonds and seafood, to enter the United States.
