The President has authorized targeted airstrikes in Iraq to support a humanitarian operation in the town of Amirli. Thousands of Shia Turkomen in the town have been cut off from food, water, and medical supplies for two months by ISIL. The United States, along with Australia, France, and the United Kingdom, delivered aid to the town. These operations are in line with previous military missions in Iraq, which aim to protect U.S. personnel, address the humanitarian situation, and are done in coordination with the Iraqi government. The Administration will continue to consult with Congress and provide reports consistent with the War Powers Resolution.
