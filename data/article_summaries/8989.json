On Child Health Day, President Biden reaffirms the commitment to ensuring equal access to quality and affordable healthcare, child care, and education for every child in America. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted children's health and well-being, causing isolation, mental health issues, and learning loss. Families are also facing financial struggles. The President emphasizes the importance of schools in safeguarding children's health and supporting their development. The American Rescue Plan provides funding for schools to ensure safe in-person instruction and address COVID-19 risks. The plan also supports school-based health programs, mental health services, youth suicide prevention, and maternal and child health. Additionally, it lowers health insurance premiums and expands the Child Tax Credit to assist families. The President calls upon families, professionals, organizations, and governments to prioritize the safety and health of America's children.
