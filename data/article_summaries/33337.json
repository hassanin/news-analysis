According to Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Robert L. Wilkie, President Donald Trump has done more in two years to strengthen the military and reform the Department of Veterans Affairs than any other president. Trump has focused on serving veterans and has implemented key initiatives, such as the MISSION Act and the Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, to improve their lives and provide them with more choices for healthcare. These reforms make the VA one of the most accountable agencies in the federal government.
