President Donald J. Trump has signed a directive that puts human exploration back at the core of America's space program. The directive, called Space Policy Directive 1, refocuses America's space program on human exploration and discovery. The goal is to return American astronauts to the moon for the first time since 1972 and establish a foundation for a mission to Mars. The directive is seen as a way to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers and spur innovation. By maintaining a continuous human presence in low-Earth orbit, the United States also aims to enhance national security and capacity for defense.
