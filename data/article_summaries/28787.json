Vice President Pence is going on a national tour to promote the importance of ratifying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). He believes that the USMCA is crucial for maintaining the momentum of the US economy, creating jobs, and promoting growth in manufacturing and the automotive industry. Pence hopes that Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, will recognize the significance of the USMCA and pass it into law. He emphasizes that the USMCA is a win for American workers and jobs, as it levels the playing field and prevents job outsourcing. Pence also mentions that the deal has already been negotiated and that there may be some give-and-take in the implementing legislation. He stresses that passing the USMCA is essential and that Congress needs to set aside politics and focus on creating jobs and opportunities for Americans. If the USMCA does not pass, Pence believes that it would be a missed opportunity for economic growth and job creation. Regarding concerns about tariffs, Pence states that the priority is to get the USMCA approved, and then other tariff issues can be addressed. Finally, when asked about the Mueller report, Pence expresses confidence in its conclusions and believes that the focus should be on important issues such as the economy and addressing the opioid crisis.
