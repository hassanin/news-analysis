The White House announced $2.4 billion in grants to accelerate the manufacturing and deployment of the next generation of batteries and electric vehicles in the United States. These grants, funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will support 48 new advanced battery and electric drive projects in over 20 states. The projects will help establish American leadership in creating advanced vehicles and will create tens of thousands of new jobs. The grants will be used to produce batteries and their components, expand battery recycling capacity, produce electric drive components, purchase plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles for testing and deployment, install electric charging infrastructure, and provide education and workforce training. The largest investment in advanced battery technology for hybrid and electric-drive vehicles ever made, this funding is expected to result in the creation of tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the battery and auto industries.
