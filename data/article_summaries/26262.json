This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Donald Trump on February 27, 2020. The memorandum addresses the effect of titanium sponge imports on national security. The Secretary of Commerce conducted an investigation and found that imports of titanium sponge threaten to impair national security by placing domestic producers under financial stress. The Secretary also noted that the United States depends heavily on imports of titanium sponge and lacks the capacity to produce it domestically for defense and critical infrastructure needs. However, the memorandum does not recommend taking actions to adjust imports at this time. Instead, it directs the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce to form a working group with other executive departments and agencies, including their counterparts in Japan, to discuss measures to ensure access to titanium sponge for national defense and critical industries. The Secretary of Defense is also instructed to take appropriate actions, including using authorities under the Defense Production Act and seeking new appropriations, to increase access to titanium sponge and support domestic production capacity. The Secretaries are required to provide periodic updates on their progress. The memorandum concludes with general provisions stating that it does not impair existing authorities or create any legally enforceable rights or benefits.
