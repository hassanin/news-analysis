With less than a week before the end of the fiscal year, extreme House Republicans are risking a government shutdown that could have damaging impacts across the country. One of the programs at risk is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which serves nearly half of babies born in the US. During a shutdown, women and children who rely on WIC could be turned away at grocery stores as the federal contingency fund dries up after a few days. Many states would be left with limited funds to operate the program, putting food assistance for these families in jeopardy. House Republicans have proposed a continuing resolution that makes devastating cuts to programs like WIC instead of working in a bipartisan manner to keep the government open and address emergency needs. They have also refused to include the Administration's request for additional WIC funding, which is necessary to ensure the program can serve every eligible person. Without this funding, states may have to institute waiting lists for WIC, causing mothers and children to lose access to vital nutrition assistance. The article provides a state-by-state breakdown of the number of women and children at risk of losing critical nutrition assistance under a government shutdown caused by extreme House Republicans.
