This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Donald J. Trump on April 29, 2019. The memorandum is addressed to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Energy. The subject of the memorandum is a Presidential Determination pursuant to Section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. 

The determination is based on various factors such as reports submitted by the Energy Information Administration, global economic conditions, increased oil production by the United States and other countries, spare petroleum production capacity, and the availability of strategic reserves. 

Based on these factors, the President determines that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran to allow for a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions. The President states that he will continue to closely monitor the situation. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
