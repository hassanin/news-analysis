The leaders of Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, the United States, and Uruguay have come together to establish the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity. The partnership aims to deepen economic collaboration and integration in the Americas and pursue an ambitious economic and development agenda. Five initial priorities have been identified: advancing inclusive and sustainable growth, developing inclusive and sustainable approaches to trade and investment, pursuing high-standard finance and investment initiatives, building resilient regional value and supply chains, and promoting social, cultural, economic, and political inclusion. The partnership will work towards these priorities through three tracks: Foreign Affairs, Trade, and Finance. The leaders also call for the involvement of underrepresented communities and stakeholders, as well as the regular engagement of ministers and the establishment of a process to welcome additional countries to join the partnership. The leaders intend to meet every two years to assess progress and identify further opportunities for collaboration.
