The President has announced his intent to nominate a new U.S. Attorney and a new U.S. Marshal. These officials are crucial for upholding the rule of law and enforcing federal law. The nominees were chosen for their dedication to enforcing the law, their professionalism, their experience, their commitment to equal justice, and their support for the independence of the Department of Justice. The President has proposed a budget increase for law enforcement to address the rising crime rate inherited by the administration. Additionally, efforts have been launched to combat gun crime, including increasing police presence, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys is important for these initiatives. The President has announced a total of 68 U.S. Attorney nominees and 22 U.S. Marshal nominees.
