This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2014. The order is titled "Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine" and expands the scope of a national emergency declared in a previous executive order. The order blocks the property and interests in property of certain individuals and entities involved in the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation with respect to Ukraine. It also prohibits the entry of these individuals into the United States and restricts the making of donations to them. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to take necessary actions to carry out the order, and circumstances can be reviewed to determine if the blocking of property is still warranted. The order went into effect on March 17, 2014.
