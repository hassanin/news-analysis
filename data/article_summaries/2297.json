President Biden has established the White House Gender Policy Council to address gender equity and equality. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the inequalities faced by women and girls, especially those of color. The Council will work on issues such as economic security, pay equity, caregiving, and education. It will also focus on combating gender-based violence globally and working towards gender equality in conflict prevention, peacebuilding, and development assistance. The Council will collaborate with various federal agencies to develop agency-wide plans for gender equity and compile a government-wide strategy for advancing gender equity and equality. The goal is to approach every issue with gender equity in mind and hold the government accountable for meeting clear goals. The Council recognizes the unique barriers faced by Black women and girls, Indigenous women and girls, and other women and girls of color.
