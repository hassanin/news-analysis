President Joe Biden has issued an executive order focused on addressing climate-related financial risks. The order aims to increase the stability of federal operations and protect the financial system from climate-related risks. It calls for the development of a comprehensive government-wide strategy to measure, assess, mitigate, and disclose climate-related financial risks. The order also directs financial regulators to assess climate-related risks to the stability of the financial system and issue a report on efforts to integrate climate-related risks into their policies and programs. Additionally, the order emphasizes the importance of integrating climate-related risks into federal lending, underwriting, and procurement processes. The Secretary of Labor is instructed to identify actions to protect the life savings and pensions of US workers and families from climate-related risks, while agencies are required to integrate climate-related risks into their procurement process. The order also reinstates the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and calls for the identification and quantification of federal climate-related financial risk exposure. Overall, the order aims to position the US to lead the global economy towards a more sustainable future.
