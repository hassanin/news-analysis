The article is a transcript of a press gaggle with Josh Earnest, the Press Secretary for the White House, on April 2, 2014. Earnest discusses President Obama's upcoming speech in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he will talk about the economic benefits of raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Earnest mentions that other businesses, like Costco and Gap, have raised their workers' pay, which has increased productivity and reduced turnover. He also mentions that many governors are fighting to raise the minimum wage in their states, and the President has signed an executive order raising the pay of federal contractors. Earnest emphasizes the need for Congress to raise the minimum wage for everyone else, as it would reward hard work and benefit 28 million hardworking Americans. The President will be joined by Congressman Peters and Congressman Conyers, who are strong advocates for raising the minimum wage. The press gaggle also touches on topics such as the Supreme Court ruling on campaign contribution limits, the Mideast peace process, the use of Jonathan Pollard as a bargaining chip, and the President's support for D.C. voting rights. Earnest briefly mentions the GM recalls and the routine maintenance of Air Force One.
