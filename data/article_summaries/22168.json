In this article, President Barack Obama expresses his commitment to fighting for the American people and ensuring that their voices are heard above the interests of corporations and lobbyists in Washington. He discusses the Supreme Court's recent ruling that allows corporations to use their economic power to directly influence elections, which he sees as an attack on democracy. Obama highlights the progress his administration has made in reducing the influence of special interests, such as implementing reforms to restrict the relationship between lobbyists and the government and disclosing daily visits to the White House. However, he acknowledges that the Supreme Court ruling is a setback to these efforts and warns of the potential consequences, including an influx of money from special interests and foreign corporations into elections. Obama emphasizes the need for bipartisan support in developing a strong response to the ruling and reiterates his determination to fight for the American people and limit the influence of powerful interests in Washington.
