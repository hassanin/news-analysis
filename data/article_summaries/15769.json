On March 31, 2010, the President signed two laws: the "Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010" and the "Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009" (also known as the PACT Act). 

The Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act extends authorities related to the collection of taxes, funding the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, making expenditures from the fund, and granting funds to airports under the Airport Improvement Program. This extension is in effect until April 30, 2010.

The PACT Act requires entities that sell or ship cigarettes in interstate commerce to register with the Department of Justice. It also establishes requirements for entities engaged in mail-order or Internet sales of cigarettes, including shipping and packaging, recordkeeping, and tax collection. The Department of Justice is required to maintain a list of unregistered or noncompliant sellers, and the act prohibits the delivery of cigarettes through the U.S. Postal Service.
