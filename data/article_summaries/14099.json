The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has passed a resolution holding Iran accountable for its failure to comply with international obligations regarding its nuclear program. The IAEA's report revealed that Iran had been hiding its uranium enrichment program and engaging in covert research and development related to building a nuclear warhead for delivery on a ballistic missile. The United States, along with other countries, is determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons due to the threat it poses to regional peace and international security. The US will continue to pressure and isolate Iran until it changes its behavior.
