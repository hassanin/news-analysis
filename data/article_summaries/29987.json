President Donald J. Trump's Administration has announced plans to establish the United States â€“ Africa Institute for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation (the U.S.-Africa Institute). The institute aims to partner with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to prevent pandemics and enhance healthcare in Africa. HBCUs will serve as principal partners in this effort, utilizing their expertise to address health emergencies and respond to disease outbreaks. The U.S. government has been investing in Africa's public health for the past two decades, and this initiative further strengthens the partnership between the United States and the African continent. President Trump is pleased to have the support of HBCUs in this endeavor.
