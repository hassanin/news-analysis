President Biden has announced his intent to nominate Dr. Arati Prabhakar as the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and as Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. If confirmed, Prabhakar will be the first woman, immigrant, or person of color to hold this position. As the President's Chief Advisor for Science and Technology, she will also serve as a co-chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and a member of the President's Cabinet. 

Prabhakar has previously been unanimously confirmed by the Senate to lead the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and served as the director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). At DARPA, she oversaw the development of breakthrough technologies such as stealth aircraft and the Internet. Under her leadership, DARPA also initiated the development of a rapid-response mRNA vaccine platform in response to COVID-19. 

Prabhakar's nomination is historic, as she would become the first woman, immigrant, or person of color to be confirmed as the director of OSTP. She has extensive experience in federal R&D agencies, startups, large companies, universities, government labs, and nonprofits. Prabhakar is an engineer and applied physicist with a background in management and leadership. She is also a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.
