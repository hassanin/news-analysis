President Obama has declared a major disaster in Kentucky due to severe storms, tornadoes, flooding, and mudslides that occurred between May 3-20, 2009. Federal aid will be provided to supplement recovery efforts in the affected areas. Assistance will include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid individuals and businesses in recovering from the disaster.

Additional designations may be made if further damage assessments warrant it. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
