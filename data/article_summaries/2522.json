Today, millions of American families will receive their first monthly Child Tax Credit payments, totaling an estimated $15 billion. The American Rescue Plan has increased the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $3,000 per child between the ages of 6 and 17, and to $3,600 for each child under the age of 6. This increase aims to provide critical tax relief to middle-class families and lift millions of children out of poverty. Over 97% of families receiving the expanded credit are working families, and over 26 million children from low-income families will now receive the full Child Tax Credit. Experts project that the expanded credit could cut child poverty by around half. Studies show that children who receive more in refundable credits perform better in school, have higher educational attainment, and earn more as adults. The Biden administration plans to extend the new Child Tax Credit beyond 2021 through the American Families Plan and Build Back Better agenda.
