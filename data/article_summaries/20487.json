President Obama has proclaimed November 2012 as National Entrepreneurship Month in the United States. The proclamation highlights the importance of entrepreneurship in driving economic growth and job creation. The government has taken various measures to support entrepreneurs and small businesses, including tax cuts, initiatives to connect innovators with funding and mentorship, and the launch of a virtual one-stop shop called BusinessUSA. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act has made it easier for innovative companies to go public and for ordinary Americans to invest in startups through crowdfunding platforms. The government has also implemented programs to encourage entrepreneurship, such as the Presidential Innovation Fellows program and Self-Employment Assistance programs. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to celebrate National Entrepreneurship Month and National Entrepreneurs' Day on November 16, 2012.
