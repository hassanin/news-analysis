In a statement by Christina Romer, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, she discusses the employment situation in February. While the labor market is still distressed, there are signs of stabilization and gradual healing. The unemployment rate remained at 9.7 percent, indicating that the decline seen in January was likely genuine. The number of workers unemployed for more than 26 weeks decreased by 180,000, the first decline in over a year. However, payroll employment declined by 36,000, possibly due to the negative impact of snowstorms in the Mid-Atlantic region in mid-February. Workers who missed pay due to the weather were not counted as being on the payroll. The impact of bad weather on the employment number is expected to be counteracted next month when these workers are counted again. Temporary Census employment also contributed about 15,000 to the payroll employment total in February. Romer emphasizes that an unemployment rate of 9.7 percent is still too high and calls for Congress to pass measures to promote job creation. She also highlights the importance of supporting those struggling with unemployment. Romer cautions against reading too much into any individual data release, considering the disruptions caused by weather. Although the overall trajectory of the economy has improved, there may still be challenges ahead.
