Vice President Biden met with members of the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel for Sudan, including former South African President Thabo Mbeki, to discuss resolving outstanding issues related to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in Sudan. They particularly focused on the issue of Abyei. The Vice President expressed concern about the deteriorating security conditions in Darfur and the restrictions on peacekeepers' and humanitarian workers' access to vulnerable populations. He emphasized the importance of establishing two viable states in Sudan after South Sudan's independence in July and stressed that resolving the situation in Darfur should be part of that process. Both sides committed to working together to garner international support for addressing their shared interests. The meeting builds on Vice President Biden's previous trip to Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa to promote regional cooperation on CPA implementation.
