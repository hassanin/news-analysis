President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Dr. Jill Biden have put forward nearly 50 commitments by Federal agencies to support military families. This initiative aims to establish a coordinated and comprehensive approach to supporting military families. The commitments address four strategic priorities: enhancing the well-being and psychological health of military families, ensuring excellence in military children's education and development, providing career and educational opportunities for military spouses, and increasing child care availability and quality for the Armed Forces. The Federal Government is partnering with various agencies to expand capacity and quality of services, tackle homelessness among veterans, promote career opportunities for military spouses, and raise awareness on the challenges facing military families. The Department of Education is prioritizing support for military families in its grant programs, and the Treasury Department is establishing an Office of Service Member Affairs to protect military families from predatory lending. The report also highlights the contributions of military families as a national and community resource and aims to strengthen feedback mechanisms for them to voice their concerns and opinions.
