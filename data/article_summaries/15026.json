Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Edward Kennedy, has passed away. She is remembered for her many roles, including being a mother who inspired her children to serve others, a wife who supported her husband in the Peace Corps and in politics, and the founder of the Special Olympics. She championed for people with intellectual disabilities and taught the world that no physical or mental barrier can stop the power of the human spirit. Her leadership greatly impacted the lives of Special Olympians worldwide. The thoughts and prayers of President Obama and his wife Michelle are with Sargent Shriver, their children, and the entire Kennedy family.
