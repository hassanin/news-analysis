President Donald Trump has signed a series of Executive Orders and Presidential Memoranda aimed at reducing regulations and expediting energy and infrastructure projects. One of the Memoranda focuses on approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would connect oil production in Canada to refineries in the US. The construction and operation of the pipeline is expected to create jobs, enhance energy security, and generate tax revenues. Another Memorandum directs federal agencies to expedite reviews and approvals for the Dakota Access Pipeline, which aims to transport crude oil from North Dakota to US oil markets. Trump also issued a Memorandum calling for all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted or expanded pipelines, to use materials and equipment produced in the US to the maximum extent possible. Additionally, a Memorandum was issued to streamline permitting and reduce regulatory burdens for domestic manufacturing. Finally, an Executive Order was signed to expedite environmental reviews for high priority infrastructure projects.
