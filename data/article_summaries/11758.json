President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Alaska due to severe storms, straight-line winds, flooding, and landslides that occurred between September 15-30, 2012. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Kenneth K. Suiso has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
