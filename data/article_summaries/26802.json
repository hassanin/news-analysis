President Donald J. Trump will award the Medal of Honor to Sergeant Major Thomas P. Payne, United States Army, for his actions during a daring nighttime hostage rescue in Kirkuk Province, Iraq, on October 22, 2015. Payne led a combined assault team to clear buildings known to house hostages. He liberated 38 hostages in one building and then, on his own initiative, moved to the other building under enemy fire. Payne engaged enemy fighters, climbed to the roof, and used grenades and small arms fire. He entered the building, enduring smoke, heat, and flames to free the hostages. Payne's courageous actions motivated the team members to assist with cutting the locks and ultimately freed 37 hostages. He facilitated their evacuation despite being ordered to leave the collapsing building himself. Payne's heroism resulted in the liberation of 75 hostages and the killing of 20 enemy fighters. He will receive the Medal of Honor on September 11, 2020.
