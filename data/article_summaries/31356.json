The article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued by Donald J. Trump on September 8, 2020, regarding the withdrawal of certain areas of the United States Outer Continental Shelf from leasing disposition. Under the authority granted to him in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, Trump withdraws these areas from leasing for a period of 10 years, starting from July 1, 2022, until June 30, 2032. The areas include those designated by the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 and those currently designated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management as the South Atlantic and Straits of Florida Planning Areas. This withdrawal prevents these areas from being considered for exploration, development, or production purposes during the specified period. However, the withdrawal does not apply to leasing for environmental conservation purposes. It is important to note that existing leases in the withdrawn areas are not affected by this memorandum. The memorandum clarifies that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
