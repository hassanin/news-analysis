President Trump announced his support for a bipartisan prison reform bill called the FIRST STEP Act. The bill aims to make communities safer and give former inmates a second chance at life by providing incentives for inmates to learn skills for employment, allowing inmates to be placed closer to home for family visitation, and implementing reasonable sentencing reforms while keeping dangerous criminals off the streets. Trump highlighted the importance of maintaining family and community ties for successful reentry into society. He also mentioned the support of law enforcement and the faith community for the bill. Trump urged lawmakers to work quickly and send the bill to his desk for signing.
