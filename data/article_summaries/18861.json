President Obama announced the National Export Initiative (NEI) to double U.S. exports and create two million new jobs. The Administration is taking five steps under the NEI to support U.S. firms in expanding their sales abroad: creating a new Cabinet-level focus on exports, expanding export financing, prioritizing government advocacy for U.S. exporters, providing resources to U.S. businesses seeking to export, and ensuring a level playing field for U.S. exporters in global markets. The President also signed an Executive Order to enhance and coordinate federal efforts to promote exports, including the creation of the Export Promotion Cabinet and the relaunch of the President's Export Council. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) is increasing its support for U.S. exporters and expanding its efforts to work with small businesses. The government is also launching trade missions, a market exporter initiative, an international business partnership program, and a commercial diplomacy strategy. The Administration is providing increased support and resources for potential U.S. exporters by increasing funding for export promotion programs and creating one-stop export promotion shops. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) will continue to enforce trade rights and work towards opening new markets. The Administration is also reforming the export control system to enhance national security and the competitiveness of key U.S. industries. The President announced specific steps to reduce the delay of U.S. exports of encryption products.
