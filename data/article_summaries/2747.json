President Biden has declared a major disaster in Alaska and authorized federal assistance to support recovery efforts in areas affected by severe storms, winds, flooding, landslides, and mudslides from late October to early November 2021. The federal funding will be available to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and repair or replacement of damaged facilities in the Kenai Peninsula Borough. Additionally, funding will be provided for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Thomas J. Dargan has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations, and more designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
