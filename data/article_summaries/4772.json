The article expresses gratitude for the work of Senator Capito and her colleagues on a proposal that includes increased funding of nearly $1 trillion. The article acknowledges the constructive additions made to the proposal, particularly regarding roads, bridges, and rail. However, there are concerns that the plan does not allocate substantial funds for critical needs such as veterans' hospitals, modern rail systems, transit systems, lead pipe removal, and clean energy. The article also mentions uncertainty about how the plan will be funded, with worries that major cuts in COVID relief funds could affect aid to small businesses, restaurants, and rural hospitals. The President has thanked Senator Capito for the proposal and will follow up after receiving more details. Other proposals are also being explored, and efforts will be made to advance jobs legislation when Congress resumes legislative business in June.
