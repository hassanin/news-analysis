First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden visited Sears in Columbus, Ohio as part of their national tour for military families. They were joined by Labor Secretary Hilda Solis to highlight the commitments made by major businesses as part of the Joining Forces initiative. The focus of the visit was on private sector commitments that ensure job transferability for military spouses when soldiers are transferred. Sears Holdings announced its "PCS Promise," which provides transfers for military personnel and spouses employed at Sears Holdings in cases of Permanent Change of duty Station (PCS), retirement, or separation. They also announced a virtual career fair for military spouses to connect with employment opportunities at 3,900 locations. Walmart and Sam's Club also announced their Military Family Promise, guaranteeing a job at a nearby store or club for military personnel and spouses who move due to military transfers. Other businesses, including Siemens Corporation, SCORE, Cisco/Futures, Indeed.com, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have committed to hiring and training initiatives for veterans and family members, as well as job options for military spouses. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce will conduct hiring fairs for veterans and military spouses in 100 local communities across the country. The Joining Forces initiative aims to provide support for military families and has received commitments from various sectors of society, including citizens, businesses, non-profits, and government.
