The presidential memorandum extends the use of the National Guard by governors to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitate economic recovery. It states that the federal cost share for the use of National Guard forces in the states of Florida and Texas will terminate on December 31, 2020. However, to maximize assistance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will fund 75% of emergency assistance activities in several states and territories using their National Guard forces. This funding will be available for orders authorizing duty through March 31, 2021. The memorandum also includes general provisions and directs the Secretary of Defense to publish it in the Federal Register.
