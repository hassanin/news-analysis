President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Grant of Clemency (Full Pardon) for Army First Lieutenant Clint Lorance, Army Major Mathew Golsteyn, and ordered the promotion of Special Warfare Operator First Class Edward R. Gallagher. Lieutenant Lorance was pardoned for ordering his men to engage and killing two of three men on a motorcycle in Afghanistan in 2012. Major Golsteyn, who is set to stand trial for an alleged unlawful killing during the Afghanistan War, was granted clemency due to concerns about deficiencies in the Afghan detention system. Special Warfare Operator First Class Edward Gallagher, who was acquitted on serious charges but stripped of honors, will be promoted back to the rank of Chief Petty Officer. The President's actions are in line with granting second chances to deserving individuals, particularly those in uniform who have served the country.
