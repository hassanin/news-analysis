On June 24, 2009, the White House released a statement from the President regarding the signing of the Supplemental Appropriations Act. The President thanked members of Congress for putting politics aside and supporting a bill that will provide funding for the safety of troops and the American people. The legislation aims to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end, defeat terrorist networks in Afghanistan, and prepare the nation for a continued outbreak of the H1N1 pandemic flu.
