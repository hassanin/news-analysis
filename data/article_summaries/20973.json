Vice President Biden and Secretary Vilsack visited the Goshen Medical Center in Faison, North Carolina to highlight how the Recovery Act is helping rural health clinics. The Recovery Act has invested $2 billion in community health centers, with $500 million already distributed to clinics across the nation. These centers serve a critical need for millions of Americans living in rural areas. The Goshen Medical Center in Faison is receiving $635,876 through the Recovery Act, which will be used to increase staffing and serve 4,800 new patients, including 1,500 without health insurance. This funding will also create seven new health center jobs. In total, 27 community health centers in North Carolina are receiving over $8.6 million to provide primary healthcare for over 41,000 additional patients, including 26,889 uninsured individuals. The Goshen Medical Center served 40,457 patients in 2007, with 33% uninsured and 67% having incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Line. Community health centers play a crucial role in providing primary care, with nearly 1,100 health center grant recipients operating over 7,000 community-based clinics across the US. These centers treated over 16 million people in 2008, with nearly 40% of patients having no health insurance and one-third being children. Community Health Centers also support over 105,000 jobs and leverage over $9 billion in needed health services.
