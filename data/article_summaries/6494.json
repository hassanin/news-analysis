In a press conference, President Joe Biden addressed concerns about the rising number of COVID-19 cases, particularly due to the Omicron variant. He emphasized that being fully vaccinated and getting the booster shot provides a high degree of protection against severe illness. However, he urged unvaccinated individuals to get vaccinated as they are at a higher risk of getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19.

The President acknowledged the fatigue and frustration people are experiencing, especially during the holiday season. He reassured vaccinated individuals that they can celebrate the holidays as planned, but advised them to remain vigilant and wear masks in public indoor settings.

President Biden outlined additional steps his administration is taking to combat the spread of COVID-19. These steps include ramping up vaccination and booster efforts, expanding testing capacity, preparing hospitals for potential surges in cases, and keeping businesses and schools open with necessary safety measures in place.

He also addressed the issue of testing availability, acknowledging that the rapid spread of the Omicron variant created a surge in demand. The federal government is working to increase testing capacity, including setting up emergency testing sites and purchasing half a billion additional at-home rapid tests to be distributed for free.

President Biden discussed the importance of trust and unity in addressing the pandemic and urged Americans to get vaccinated, follow safety measures, and support one another during this challenging time. He also mentioned the possibility of reversing travel bans in response to the Omicron variant and expressed his commitment to working with Senator Joe Manchin to advance legislation.
