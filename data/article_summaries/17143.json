The G-20 Leaders have agreed to implement a comprehensive set of policies to reinvigorate global economic recovery. They have emphasized the need for strengthened international policy cooperation and providing more and better jobs for citizens. The financial crisis in Europe is identified as the most serious risk to global recovery, but progress in rebalancing global demand has also stalled. The G-20 members have committed to measures to secure the recovery, including restoring debt sustainability in Greece, strengthening European banks, and building firewalls to avoid contagion. The United States, Japan, and other countries with relatively strong public finances will implement specific measures to support growth. Emerging market economies will implement policies to support domestic demand-led growth and move towards market-determined exchange rates. The stability of banking systems and financial markets will be preserved, and the IMF will have adequate resources. The G-20 Leaders have also agreed on an action plan to strengthen the medium-term foundations for growth, including sustainable public finances, open trade and investment markets, structural reforms, and actions to promote development. Specific commitments include rebalancing demand towards domestic consumption, stabilizing oil markets, resisting trade protectionism, implementing structural reforms, and implementing financial sector reforms. These commitments are expected to lead to stronger and more sustainable global growth and create good jobs for citizens.
