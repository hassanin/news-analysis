President Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate regarding an alternate plan for monthly basic pay increases for members of the uniformed services in 2014. The President is committed to supporting the uniformed service members but believes tough choices need to be made to maintain a sustainable fiscal course. Therefore, he has decided to set the 2014 monthly basic pay increase at 1.0 percent, which is consistent with his fiscal year 2014 Budget and will not significantly impact the government's ability to attract and retain qualified members for the uniformed services. This adjustment will take effect on the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2014.
