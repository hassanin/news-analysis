The Biden-Harris Administration recently held a mental health summit focused on improving access to behavioral health care for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities. The event aimed to address the mental health crisis faced by these communities, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, rising anti-Asian hate, and gun violence. Suicide rates among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, particularly among young individuals, have been a significant concern. The administration is taking a whole-of-society approach to transform behavioral health services and support underserved communities. This includes eliminating barriers to care, expanding prevention and treatment services, promoting language access, conducting research, providing mental health services in schools, supporting workers' mental health, and delivering justice and resources to these communities.
