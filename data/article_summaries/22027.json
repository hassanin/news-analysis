On July 6, 2009, Presidents Obama and Medvedev signed a Joint Understanding to guide the negotiations for a new treaty on reducing and limiting strategic offensive arms. The new treaty will replace the expiring Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and will include reductions in strategic warheads to a range of 1500-1675 and strategic delivery vehicles to a range of 500-1100. These reductions will be lower than those in any existing arms control agreements. The new treaty will also include effective verification measures and enhance the security, predictability, and stability of strategic offensive forces for both the U.S. and Russia. The negotiations for the new treaty began in April 2009 and will continue towards finalizing an agreement for signature and ratification.
