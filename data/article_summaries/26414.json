The US Department of the Treasury and the Department of State have announced sanctions on four individuals and ten entities that are supporting the Assad regime in Syria. These designations target individuals and entities involved in supporting the regime, including a corrupt businessman and entities involved in luxury real estate construction. The US also designated three Assad regime figures, including a senior regime general and the regime-controlled First Division of the Syrian Arab Army for obstructing a ceasefire. These sanctions are part of a sustained campaign to deny the Assad regime the resources it uses to wage war. The US emphasizes that these actions are not directed at the Syrian people, whom they support in their efforts for peace and stability. The US remains committed to a political solution in Syria and urges the Assad regime and its patrons to recognize that a political resolution is the only way to bring an end to the conflict.
