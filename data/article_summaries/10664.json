The statement by the Press Secretary on Syria emphasizes the belief that Bashar al-Assad needs to leave power for the Syrian people to achieve the change they deserve. The Assad regime's words have lost credibility due to their continued outrageous actions. Despite committing to end violence and withdraw security forces from residential areas, the regime has violated this commitment by indiscriminately killing civilians and army defectors, destroying property, and arresting protesters without due process. While Syrian security forces have also suffered casualties, most of the violence and loss of life stems from the actions of the Assad regime. The statement calls for an end to violence and the full implementation of the Arab League agreement, including the withdrawal of security forces, release of political prisoners, and access for monitors and international media. The Assad regime is already facing isolation and sanctions, and the international community urges Syria's remaining supporters to warn Damascus that failure to implement the Arab League initiative will result in additional pressure. The world is watching, and both the international community and the Syrian people do not accept Assad's legitimacy.
