President Obama has announced that the Federal Government will reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution by 28 percent by 2020. This reduction is aimed at leading by example in building the clean energy economy and will result in energy cost reductions, job creation, and innovation in clean energy industries. The Federal Government is the largest energy consumer in the U.S. economy and achieving this target will reduce energy use, equivalent to taking 17 million cars off the road for one year and saving $8 to $11 billion in energy costs through 2020. Federal agencies will achieve these reductions by measuring their current energy use, becoming more energy efficient, and shifting to clean energy sources. Examples of agency actions already underway include installing solar arrays, tapping landfills for renewable energy, and replacing older vehicles with more fuel-efficient models. The Office of Management and Budget will validate and score each agency's sustainability plan to ensure accountability, and annual progress will be reported to the public.
