The article is about Secretary Sebelius's address to America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) conference. She acknowledges the challenges faced by insurance companies due to the increasing number of young, healthy Americans leaving the market and the lack of choice and competition in the insurance market. She highlights the frustration of customers when their premiums increase significantly and the system fails to protect them from high healthcare costs. Secretary Sebelius emphasizes the need to empower families and small business owners in the healthcare system. She presents two choices for insurance companies - to continue opposing reform, which would lead to negative consequences such as higher premiums and fewer people with insurance, or to use their resources to provide relief to Americans from rising premiums and support meaningful reform. She suggests that the latter choice would lead to a sustainable health insurance market and benefit both the American people and insurance companies.
