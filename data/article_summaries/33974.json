President Donald J. Trump's Administration is committed to achieving the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The United States, along with the Republic of Korea and the international community, agree that denuclearization should be the result of any dialogue with North Korea. The maximum pressure campaign will continue until North Korea denuclearizes. President Trump believes that there is a brighter path available for North Korea if it chooses denuclearization. The United States and the world must continue to emphasize that North Korea's nuclear and missile programs are a dead end.
