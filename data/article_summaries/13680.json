The United States has provided assistance to Moldova in its efforts to build democratic institutions, a prosperous economy, and ensure sovereignty and security. As Moldova prepares to sign agreements with the European Union, the United States has targeted programs to help Moldova advance its European aspirations. Vice President Joe Biden announced an additional $8 million in assistance to Moldova, pending consultations with the U.S. Congress, to support Moldova's European choice and mitigate vulnerabilities to external pressure. This assistance will build upon previous funds announced on March 3, which aim to increase productivity and competitiveness of Moldovan businesses and position them to take advantage of European markets. In total, the United States is providing approximately $31 million in assistance to Moldova this year, and has provided approximately $1.2 billion in assistance since 1992. The assistance focuses on improving governance, increasing transparency and accountability, strengthening the rule of law, combating corruption, promoting economic growth, supporting energy efficiency, enhancing civic and economic ties, building law enforcement capacity, promoting international peacekeeping operations, and encouraging reforms necessary for European integration.
