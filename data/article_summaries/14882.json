One year ago, the US administration implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) process, which aimed to protect young immigrants brought to the country as children from deportation. The purpose was to allow law enforcement to focus on dangerous criminals rather than students seeking an education. The administration believes that these young individuals are Americans in every way except on paper and, as a result of this action, many have been able to come out of hiding and no longer fear deportation. However, the administration recognizes that this is not a permanent solution and urges Congress to pass a bipartisan immigration reform bill to allow these "Dreamers" to continue contributing to the country.
