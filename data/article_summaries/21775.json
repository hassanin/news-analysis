President Obama expressed his gratitude for the dedicated service of Christine H. Fox, who recently retired as Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense. Fox had agreed to return to the Department of Defense after her retirement to support Secretary Hagel and the President during a challenging time. She provided steady leadership during the sequester and developed a budget approach that aimed to restore readiness to the military. President Obama commended Fox for her willingness to serve the nation once again and acknowledged her as the highest ranking woman ever to serve at the Department of Defense. He wished her the best in her future endeavors.
