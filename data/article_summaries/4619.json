Vice President Kamala Harris delivered remarks at Brown Chapel AME Church in commemoration of the 56th anniversary of the Selma Bridge Crossing. She expressed her honor in being present and acknowledged the absence of Congressman John Lewis. Harris emphasized that the spirit of Selma and Lewis lives within everyone and highlighted the actions of Black teachers who marched to the Dallas County Courthouse to register to vote before the 1965 bridge crossing. She discussed the importance of the right to vote and its impact on other rights, such as dignity at work, public education, and healthcare. Harris criticized voter suppression efforts, mentioning the gutting of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 and the recent surge in bills to restrict voting. She called for the passage of the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect voting rights. Harris emphasized that Americans want to vote and that laws should make it easier, not harder, to exercise that right. She concluded by urging people to fight for the right to vote, stating that it is an act of love for our community and country.
