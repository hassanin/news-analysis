President Barack Obama has proclaimed November 16-22, 2015 as Get Smart About Antibiotics Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of antibiotics in fighting bacterial infectious diseases, but also highlights the problem of antibiotic resistance due to their overuse and misuse. It states that more than 2 million people in the United States are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year, leading to over 23,000 deaths. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics are identified as the biggest contributing factors to antibiotic resistance. The proclamation also mentions the efforts of the Obama administration to prevent infections and improve the appropriate use of antibiotics through measures like an Executive Order and the development of a National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. The proclamation calls for the responsible use of antibiotics and raising awareness of the dangers of their misuse and overuse.
