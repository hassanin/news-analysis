This article highlights the Obama Administration's commitment to American-made energy and its efforts to develop infrastructure, promote clean alternatives to traditional fuels, and support clean energy innovation and jobs. The President announced a new Executive Order to improve the permitting and review process for infrastructure projects, with a focus on reducing the time it takes for agencies to make decisions. The President also issued a Memorandum directing federal agencies to expedite the Cushing Pipeline and other pipelines to address the urgent need for pipeline infrastructure. Additionally, the President traveled to Ohio State University to highlight investments in clean energy research and training programs. The Administration announced support for the design and licensing of small modular reactors, investments in a smarter grid to give consumers more control over their energy bills, funding for research and development in advanced biofuels, and funding to accelerate the development of stronger, lighter materials for vehicles. These efforts are part of the Administration's all-of-the-above strategy to develop American energy, reduce reliance on foreign oil, and enhance energy security.
