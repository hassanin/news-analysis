President Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm have announced the selection of seven regional clean hydrogen hubs to receive $7 billion in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This investment is aimed at accelerating the domestic market for low-cost, clean hydrogen. The goal is to achieve a strong clean energy economy, enhance energy security, promote domestic manufacturing, create jobs, and improve communities' health. The selected hubs will attract over $40 billion in private investment and generate tens of thousands of good-paying jobs. They will produce over three million metric tons of clean hydrogen per year, contributing to the 2030 U.S. clean hydrogen production goal and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Clean hydrogen is crucial for decarbonizing sectors like transportation and manufacturing. The Biden administration's focus on clean energy has already boosted U.S. manufacturing and deployment of clean energy technologies, creating union jobs and onshoring production. The regional clean hydrogen hubs program is part of the administration's commitment to investing in clean energy and achieving ambitious climate goals. The program is aligned with the Justice40 Initiative, ensuring that the benefits of federal investments reach disadvantaged communities. The Department of Energy (DOE) is also providing additional resources for clean hydrogen research and development through initiatives like the Hydrogen Hub Matchmaker. Overall, this investment in clean manufacturing and jobs is one of the largest in history.
