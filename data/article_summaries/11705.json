In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims May as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. He acknowledges the contributions and accomplishments of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States, recognizing their entrepreneurship, fortitude, and their role in building the country. Despite facing prejudice and obstacles, AAPI individuals have made significant contributions as leaders, athletes, public servants, entrepreneurs, and artists. However, the article also highlights that many AAPI communities still face challenges such as unemployment, poverty, language barriers, and disparities in education, economics, and healthcare. To address these challenges, the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders was reestablished to promote increased access to federal programs. President Obama calls upon all Americans to learn more about the history of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
