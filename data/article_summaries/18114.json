President Obama has authorized an increase in federal funding for Public Assistance projects in the Sovereign Tribal Nation of the Havasupai Tribe in Arizona. This decision comes in response to severe storms and flooding that occurred in October 2010. Previously, the Federal funding for Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation was set at 75% of total eligible costs. However, with the President's order, the Federal share for Public Assistance has been increased to 90% of the total eligible costs. For further information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
