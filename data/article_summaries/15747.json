President Obama has declared a major disaster in Kentucky and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe winter storms, snowstorms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred from February 15-22, 2015. The federal funding will be available to the commonwealth and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, to cover the cost of emergency work and repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Boyd, Boyle, Caldwell, Clark, Estill, Floyd, Harlan, Jackson, Jessamine, Knott, Knox, Lawrence, Lee, Letcher, Lyon, Marshall, Menifee, Metcalfe, Morgan, Pendleton, Perry, Pike, Powell, Simpson, Taylor, Washington, and Wolfe. Snow assistance will also be provided for a 48-hour period in some of these counties. Hazard mitigation measures will be funded throughout the state. Jose M. Girot has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
