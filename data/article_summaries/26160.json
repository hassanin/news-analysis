Vice President Pence expressed gratitude for the warm welcome in Reykjavík and highlighted the significance of the city in history. He mentioned standing with leaders from over 40 nations in Warsaw to commemorate the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which he believes was influenced by President Reagan's stance in Reykjavík in 1986. Pence emphasized the importance of Reykjavík and Iceland, not only to the people of Reykjavík and Iceland but also to the United States. He pledged the US's commitment to the safety and security of its people and its allies, while also advocating for freedom and peace.
