This article is a proclamation issued by President Donald Trump regarding the implementation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and other trade agreements. The proclamation modifies the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to provide for the preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA, establish rules for determining eligibility for preferential tariff treatment, and set tariff-rate quotas for certain goods. It also authorizes various actions by the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the Committee for Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA), and other government agencies to carry out the provisions of the trade agreements. The proclamation also includes technical corrections and modifications to the HTS for other trade agreements, such as the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, and the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement. The modifications and corrections to the HTS are detailed in the annexes of the proclamation.
