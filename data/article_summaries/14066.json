In this article, President Barack Obama issues a presidential determination regarding the unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs in South Sudan. He determines that it is important to the national interest to provide assistance under the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962. The assistance will be in the form of $50 million from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund. This funding will be used to address the refugee and migration needs resulting from the crisis in South Sudan. The assistance may include contributions to international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, as well as the payment of administrative expenses of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration of the Department of State. The memorandum concludes by authorizing and directing the publication of this determination in the Federal Register.
