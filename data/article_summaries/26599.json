President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons to undermine democratic processes or institutions of Belarus will continue beyond June 16, 2019. The President believes that these actions and policies continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and therefore, it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405.
