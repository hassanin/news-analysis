President Obama is calling on Republican senators to stop blocking a vote to prevent a 21% cut in Medicare payments to doctors. Since 2003, Congress has deferred these cuts to protect Medicare reimbursements. However, if Congress does not act, doctors will start receiving lower Medicare payments, which could result in seniors losing access to their doctors. Obama acknowledges that postponing these cuts is not a long-term solution and is committed to finding a responsible and permanent solution. He emphasizes the importance of providing fair reimbursement to doctors and maintaining healthcare for seniors. Obama urges Republican senators to allow a majority of senators and representatives to stop this payment cut and support the elderly and doctors in the United States.
