Dr. Jill Biden, wife of then-Vice President Joe Biden, was scheduled to travel to Germany and France from July 3rd to July 7th, 2009. During her visit, she planned to celebrate Independence Day with US service members and their families stationed in Germany. This trip was part of her ongoing efforts to raise awareness and show appreciation for the military and their families. After Germany, Dr. Biden would travel to Paris to deliver a keynote address at the opening ceremony of the UNESCO 2009 World Conference on Higher Education on July 5th. She would lead the US delegation and emphasize the Obama-Biden Administration's commitment to higher education and the role of community colleges. More details about Dr. Biden's trip would be announced later.
