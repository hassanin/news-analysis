Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed leaders to her office to discuss the future of the United States. The focus of the conversation was on the DREAMers, who include members of the military, college students, and frontline workers. Harris emphasized that DREAMers deserve a pathway to citizenship and that they are not alone. She mentioned that the recent federal court ruling will not immediately affect current DACA recipients but could put many young immigrants, including Diana, at risk. The administration is taking action by appealing the decision and proposing a new rule concerning DACA. Harris called for Congress to pass the American Dream and Promise Act and the Farm Workers Protection and Modernization Act to create a pathway to citizenship. She stressed that this issue is about self-determination and who we are as a country. Diana, an undocumented individual, shared her perspective and story, highlighting the challenges faced by her family and the emotional toll of being undocumented. She called on Congress to pass immigration reform with a path to citizenship. Harris agreed that action needs to be taken immediately.
