The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued warning letters to the marketers and distributors of 11 opioid cessation products for illegally marketing products with unproven claims about their ability to help in the treatment of opioid addiction and withdrawal. Selling these unapproved products with false claims is a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act. These products have not been proven to be safe or effective and may prevent patients from seeking appropriate, FDA-approved therapies. In addition to the warning letters, the FTC and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) have issued a fact sheet to help consumers get real help for opioid addiction or withdrawal while avoiding products that promise but do not deliver help. The fact sheet provides tips for consumers and health practitioners. The FDA and FTC have requested responses from the companies within 15 working days. Failure to correct violations may result in law enforcement action.
