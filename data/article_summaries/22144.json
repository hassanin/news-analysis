The White House has established the White House Rural Council to address the challenges faced by rural communities and promote economic growth. Chaired by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, the council will coordinate programs across government to encourage public-private partnerships and provide recommendations for investment in rural areas. The council will focus on job creation, expanding markets for agriculture, increasing access to credit, promoting innovation, developing regional economies, improving access to quality healthcare and education, increasing broadband opportunities, coordinating infrastructure investment, and expanding opportunities for conservation and economic growth. The Obama administration has been working to improve the lives of rural Americans by modernizing infrastructure, expanding educational opportunities, and providing affordable healthcare.
