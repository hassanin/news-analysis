President Trump announced that he has directed Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue to provide $16 billion in assistance to American farmers and ranchers. The funds will come from tariffs and charges imposed on China, and will be used to support farmers who have been negatively affected by the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China. The President also discussed the importance of fair and reciprocal trade deals, the need to protect American industry and agriculture from foreign competition, and his hope for a trade deal with China. He also addressed other topics such as the USMCA, infrastructure, and the release of John Walker Lindh. Additionally, President Trump accused some individuals, including former FBI officials, of treason for their actions during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
