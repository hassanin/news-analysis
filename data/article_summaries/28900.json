The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director James Carroll has issued a statement ahead of National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, which is on April 27. The statement emphasizes the importance of preventing drug misuse and highlights the potential dangers of leftover prescription drugs in medicine cabinets. National Take Back Day provides an opportunity for Americans to safely dispose of their unused or unwanted prescription medications. Approximately 6,000 collection sites manned by nearly 5,000 partner law enforcement agencies will be open during the event, and the public can find a nearby collection site at www.DEATakeBack.com or by calling 800-882-9539. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has collected nearly 11 million pounds (over 5,400 tons) of expired, unused, and unwanted prescription medications through Take Back Day events over the past nine years.
