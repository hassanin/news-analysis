President Obama has announced that the Atlanta Regional Multimodal Passenger Terminal project will be expedited as a significant infrastructure project. This initiative aims to make the permitting and review process for infrastructure projects more efficient and effective. The project will create a centralized transit hub in downtown Atlanta, linking various transportation networks such as high-speed rail, commuter rail, streetcar, Greyhound, MARTA, pedestrians, and cyclists. The project is part of a larger economic redevelopment plan for downtown Atlanta and will also catalyze commercial and residential development on 120 acres of underutilized land. The project is funded by the Federal Transit Administration and Georgia Department of Transportation's Public-Private Partnership program. Efforts have been made to minimize environmental and archeological impacts through proper project siting and design.
