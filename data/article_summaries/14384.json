The White House has sent a letter to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq, which was declared in Executive Order 13303 in 2003, will continue beyond May 22, 2014. The letter explains that obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the maintenance of peace and security, and the development of political and economic institutions in the country continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. President Barack Obama has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
