President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared on March 15, 1995, will continue beyond March 15, 2018. Despite the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions on Iran in 2016, non-nuclear-related sanctions remain in place due to Iran's actions and policies. These include the development of ballistic missiles, support for international terrorism, and human rights abuses. President Trump has determined that it is necessary to maintain comprehensive sanctions against Iran to address this threat.
