The Trump administration has announced a proposed rule on the Title X family planning program, which aims to improve women's health and prevent federal funds from being used to fund abortions. The rule would update regulations governing the program and ensure compliance with the existing prohibition on funding programs that use abortion as a method of family planning. Contrary to recent media reports, the proposed rule does not include a "gag rule" on counseling about abortion. The rule does not cut funds from the Title X program but aims to prevent taxpayers from indirectly funding abortions.
