The Biden-Harris Administration recently held a meeting with trucking companies and industry associations to discuss the challenges faced by the industry in meeting the high demand for goods during the pandemic recovery. The participants highlighted the important role of trucking in delivering essential goods and the existing challenges such as high turnover rates, an aging workforce, and unpaid wait time. The Administration's focus on developing a pipeline of well-trained drivers was welcomed, with Secretary Walsh announcing nearly $10 million in funding for registered apprenticeships and resources to support veteran recruitment. The participants also discussed efforts to recruit and retain a diverse workforce, including women, underrepresented minorities, and veterans, and the benefits of partnerships with unions for training and retention. The roundtable members praised the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, emphasizing the importance of infrastructure investments in supporting the industry and strengthening supply chains. The Department of Transportation's efforts to reduce delays for new drivers seeking commercial driver's licenses were also welcomed.
