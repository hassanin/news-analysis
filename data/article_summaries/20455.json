President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Washington and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts from a severe winter storm, winds, flooding, landslides, mudslides, and a tornado that occurred in December 2015. Federal funding will be available for emergency work and repairs, as well as for hazard mitigation measures throughout the state. Thomas J. Dargan has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, and more designations may be made in the future if requested by the state.
