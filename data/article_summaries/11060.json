The article is a letter from President Barack Obama to selected congressional committee leadership. In the letter, Obama discusses his National Security Strategy of 2010 and how the United States has worked to strengthen its global leadership position, end the war in Iraq, combat al-Qa'ida, and achieve economic recovery. He emphasizes the importance of a whole-of-government approach and mentions the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, which reinforced this integration. Obama informs the committee leadership of his intention to release a new National Security Strategy in early 2014, which will update the vision provided in 2010 and outline his administration's national security priorities for the remainder of his term. He mentions that a broader update on the whole-of-government implementation plan will be submitted in the spring to align with the new Strategy.
