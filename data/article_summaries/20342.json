The White House has issued a statement congratulating the people of Rwanda on their national election, in which President Paul Kagame won reelection with approximately 93% of the vote. However, the statement also expresses concern about several events leading up to the election, such as the suspension of two newspapers, the expulsion of a human rights researcher, the exclusion of two opposition parties from participating, and the arrest of journalists. The statement emphasizes that democracy goes beyond just holding elections and should include the protection of freedom of expression, freedom of the press, and the inclusion of minority voices. The White House acknowledges the challenges Rwanda has faced since the 1994 genocide and commends the country's progress but urges the government to promote democratic governance, respect for minority and opposition views, and continued peace. The statement also calls on the electoral commission to handle any election complaints fairly and promptly.
