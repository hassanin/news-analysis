This article is a statement made by President Obama on July 14, 2009, regarding the health care reform legislation introduced in the House of Representatives. The President emphasizes that this proposal will lower costs, provide better care for patients, and ensure fair treatment by the insurance industry. The plan aims to control the rising cost of health care by addressing waste and fraud, promoting quality and accountability, and saving over $500 billion over 10 years. It also aims to change incentives in the health care system, offer more choices and affordable health care, prevent insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions, and provide health insurance options for workers who lose their job or start a new business. The proposal includes a health insurance exchange that allows families and small businesses to compare prices and quality. Additionally, it introduces a public health insurance option to increase competition and keep insurance companies honest. The plan aims to cover an estimated 97% of all Americans, improve the quality of health care, reduce deficits, and bring fiscal sustainability to the nation. The President thanks the Chairmen for their hard work and looks forward to working with all House members to ensure the legislation helps all Americans.
