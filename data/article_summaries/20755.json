President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Illinois and has ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The declaration comes after severe storms, flooding, and tornadoes struck the area in May 2009. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Dolph A. Diemont has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
