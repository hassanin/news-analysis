Second Lady Karen Pence and Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt visited Shenandoah National Park to discuss the mental health benefits of spending time outdoors. Pence, who is the Lead Ambassador for PREVENTS, emphasized the importance of getting outdoors for mental health and thanked National Park Service employees for their work in reopening and preserving the park. They also met with the park's Artist-in-Residence to learn about the program and observed a watercolor class. Pence later hiked the Compton Peak Trail. The visit aligns with President Trump's call to invest in national parks and public lands. PREVENTS recently launched a national health campaign called REACH to prevent suicide.
