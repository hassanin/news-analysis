President Biden has signed a memorandum to defer the removal of certain Hong Kong residents who are currently in the United States, providing them with temporary safe haven. This move reflects the Biden administration's strong support for the people of Hong Kong in the face of ongoing repression by the Chinese government. It also sends a clear message that the U.S. will not stand idly by as China breaks its promises to Hong Kong and the international community. The Biden administration has consistently expressed opposition to China's use of the National Security Law to suppress basic rights and freedoms, erode Hong Kong's autonomy, and undermine its democratic processes. The politically motivated arrests and trials, media censorship, and restrictions on elections and democratic opposition in Hong Kong have prompted the U.S. to take further actions in support of the people there.
