First Lady Melania Trump made an unannounced visit to The Mary Elizabeth House in Washington, D.C. to deliver a donation of boxed lunches, Be Best tote bags, and other items. The Mary Elizabeth House is a ministry community home that provides life skills, counseling, and educational resources to at-risk and vulnerable single mothers and their children. The First Lady had previously donated vegetables and produce from the White House Kitchen Garden to the staff and residents of the house. During her visit, she met with staff, mothers, and their children, spent time with the children at the playground, and handed out the donated items. Mrs. Trump discussed the importance of strengthening families, protecting children, and supporting community-based prevention efforts. She also talked about an Executive Order signed by the President last week that will impact the Mary Elizabeth House and promote child and family well-being. The First Lady expressed her gratitude to the staff and volunteers for their work in providing resources and care to families in need.
