Vice President Biden has announced that the Department of Energy will provide a $25 million grant over the next five years to support cybersecurity education. The grant will support the creation of a new cybersecurity consortium consisting of 13 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), two national labs, and a k-12 school district. The goal of the consortium is to create a sustainable pipeline of students focused on cybersecurity issues. The program is designed to be flexible and reflect the unique regional priorities of universities and the research and skill development targets of DOE sites. This initiative aims to fill the growing demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals in the US job market and diversify the pipeline of talent in the STEM fields. The announcement also highlights the Administration's ongoing commitment to HBCUs.
