The United States, along with its Allies and partners, has emphasized its preparedness to impose significant consequences on Russia if it further escalates military action against Ukraine. However, the US also prefers de-escalation through diplomacy. Ahead of talks with Russia, the US outlined three principles: Europe should be involved in decisions about Europe, discussions must be reciprocal, and genuine progress can only occur in a de-escalated environment. The US has engaged in extensive consultations with European Allies and partners, including Ukraine, and has coordinated closely with them in various diplomatic engagements. This includes consultations with Ukraine, NATO, the European Union, the OSCE, Bucharest Nine (B9) and NATO Eastern Flank Allies, as well as Transatlantic Allies and partners. The US is committed to remaining in lockstep with its Allies and partners and will continue consultations with them in the future.
