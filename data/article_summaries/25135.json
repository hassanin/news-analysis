President Donald J. Trump met with the House Republican Deputy Whip Team to discuss efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. The President stated that Obamacare is collapsing, with insurers leaving the exchanges and premiums and deductibles increasing. He emphasized the need to take action now to fulfill the Republican promise of repealing the law and replacing it with a new system based on principles outlined in his recent address to Congress. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise thanked the President for his commitment to rescuing people from the Obamacare disaster and praised his recent speech. The group discussed strategies to ensure the healthcare bill passes both the House and Senate. The President assured the team members that he supports their efforts and wants Congress to act swiftly. The President plans to reconvene the group next week to continue working on the bill.
