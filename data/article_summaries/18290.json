President Obama congratulates the House of Representatives on passing the DISCLOSE Act, which aims to regulate the influx of special interest money in elections. The act includes strong disclosure requirements for election-related spending by special interests, restricts spending by foreign-controlled corporations, and gives the public the right to know who is spending money to influence campaigns. While the President acknowledges that the House bill is not perfect, he emphasizes the unprecedented transparency it brings to campaign spending and the accountability it imposes on corporations involved in American elections. He urges the Senate to act quickly on its version of the bill and expresses his readiness to collaborate with both chambers to enact the final legislation promptly.
