The progress of the vaccination program for kids ages 5 to 11 in the United States is going well, with 10% of kids already receiving their first shot within 10 days of the program being at full strength. Vaccines for kids are readily available at over 30,000 locations. The pace of vaccinations for kids has been accelerating, with 1.7 million kids getting vaccinated in the last week, double the previous week.

In addition to the kids' vaccination program, efforts are still underway to vaccinate unvaccinated Americans 12 and older and provide booster shots to eligible individuals. About 300,000 people are getting their first shot each day, and 80% of Americans 12 and older have received at least one shot. Over 31 million Americans have received a booster shot, with a focus on eligible seniors.

The United States is also making progress in its global vaccinations program, having donated and delivered 250 million doses to 110 countries. The U.S. government is committed to donating 1.2 billion doses in total, with each dose administered in the U.S. being matched with three doses donated to other countries.

The briefing also addressed the issue of health misinformation and the efforts to combat it. The Surgeon General released a toolkit to help individuals and communities address health misinformation. The toolkit provides information on what health misinformation is and how to identify and address it.

In terms of the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, the goal is to achieve control of the virus rather than complete eradication. The focus is on getting as many people vaccinated as possible and reaching a low level of transmission. The duration of public health protection measures such as masking will depend on reaching that low level of transmission.

Overall, the briefing highlighted the progress in vaccination efforts and emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated and addressing health misinformation.
