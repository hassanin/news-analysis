President Donald Trump has signed House Joint Resolution 38, which aims to stop the Stream Protection Rule from further harming coal workers and the communities that depend on them. The resolution blocks a regulation that threatened the coal industry with compliance costs, reduced coal production, and fewer jobs. Since 2009, the coal industry has declined, resulting in the loss of over 36,000 jobs and the closure of over 600 coal mines. The resolution is intended to provide relief to coal country from harmful regulations created under the Obama Administration. President Trump has been committed to reducing regulatory burdens and has required that for every new regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated.
