The United States commends Panama and President Juan Carlos Varela for their efforts in uncovering and preventing Venezuelan money laundering in Panama. This action was taken in response to the Maduro dictatorship's attempt to evade international sanctions. The United States emphasizes the need for Venezuela to restore democracy, end repression, and alleviate the suffering of its people. It also urges the international community to support Panama's stance and unite against the corrupt and illegitimate rule of the Maduro regime.
