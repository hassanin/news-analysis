President Donald J. Trump has announced that the Department of State has officially nominated Poland for entry into the Visa Waiver Program. This move aims to enhance economic, security, cultural, and people-to-people connections between the two nations. The Department of Homeland Security will now assess Poland's eligibility for the program, and if approved, Polish nationals would be authorized for visa-free travel to the United States for business and tourism. This development signifies the strong bilateral relationship between the United States and Poland and would be a significant achievement for both countries.
