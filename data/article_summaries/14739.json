President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Missouri due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred in April 2011. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected area. The declaration makes federal funding available to individuals in several counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses. Federal funding will also be available for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures. Elizabeth Turner has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional counties may be designated for assistance. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
