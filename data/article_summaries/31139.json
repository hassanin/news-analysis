President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at restoring local control in education. The order directs Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to review federal regulations and ensure that they do not hinder the ability of states, local governments, teachers, and parents to make decisions regarding education. Trump emphasized the importance of empowering parents and teachers to make decisions that help students succeed, stating that local communities know best how to educate their children. The executive order is seen as a step towards reversing federal power over education and giving power back to states and localities.
