In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims November as National Diabetes Month. He highlights the impact of diabetes on millions of Americans and emphasizes the importance of managing the disease properly to lower the risk of complications. The article explains the two common forms of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. It mentions that type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys insulin-producing cells, while type 2 diabetes is more prevalent and usually affects individuals who are older, overweight, inactive, or have a family history of the disease. The article also highlights the growing epidemic of obesity and the increasing number of children being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Preventive care, such as maintaining a healthy diet and engaging in regular exercise, is emphasized as a way to avoid diabetes and its complications. Certain populations, such as African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and the elderly, are mentioned to be at greater risk of developing diabetes. The article acknowledges the complexity of diabetes but expresses support for ongoing research and education programs. The proclamation calls on citizens, medical institutions, government agencies, businesses, non-profit organizations, and other groups to participate in activities that help prevent, treat, and manage diabetes.
