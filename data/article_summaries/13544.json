This article is a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House, explaining his decision to continue the national emergency with respect to Libya. The national emergency was initially declared in 2011 due to the extreme measures taken by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his government against the people of Libya. The actions included the use of weapons of war, mercenaries, and violence against unarmed civilians. The declaration of the national emergency was aimed at protecting Libyan state assets from being misappropriated by Qadhafi, his government, family members, or close associates. Although there have been developments in Libya, such as the fall of Qadhafi and the establishment of a democratically elected government, the situation in the country still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama has decided to continue the national emergency in order to protect against this threat and prevent the diversion of assets by certain members of Qadhafi's family and other former regime officials.
