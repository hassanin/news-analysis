The United States strongly condemns recent brutal attacks in West Africa, including the kidnapping of over 100 school girls and the murders of aid workers in Nigeria, a terrorist attack against United Nations peacekeepers in Mali that killed 4 people, and attacks in Burkina Faso that resulted in many deaths and injuries. The United States expresses condolences to the families and friends of the victims and wishes a quick recovery for the injured. These attacks only strengthen the determination of the United States and other responsible nations to pursue and eliminate those who commit such atrocious acts.
