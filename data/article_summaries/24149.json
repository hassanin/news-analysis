President Obama is calling on Congress to fix the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law before the start of the next school year. He wants a fair accountability system that rewards excellence and is based on high standards and sophisticated assessments. He also wants a flexible system that empowers principals and teachers and supports reform and innovation at the state and local level. Additionally, he wants a system that focuses on low-performing schools and provides resources to the most effective teachers. The current NCLB law is not meeting its goals and is not helping the students most at risk. President Obama's plan includes replacing NCLB's accountability system with a new framework that focuses on student learning and growth, supporting teacher effectiveness, fostering innovation and focusing on results, and providing a 21st-century education for every student. The plan aims to address the shortcomings of the current NCLB law and ensure that all students are ready for college and career.
