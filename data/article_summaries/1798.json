The Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to address "junk fees" that hurt Americans' finances and the economy. These fees are hidden charges and add-ons that can be found in various industries, such as banking, cable and internet bills, and airline tickets. These fees not only inconvenience consumers but also weaken market competition and disproportionately affect vulnerable Americans. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has announced new measures to eliminate billions of dollars in banking fees. The administration aims to create more transparent and fair markets by reducing or eliminating these fees, which can confuse consumers and make it difficult for them to compare prices and choose the best deal. Junk fees can also harm businesses by increasing switching costs and hindering market competition. By limiting or disallowing these fees, the administration hopes to encourage firms to compete on price and product quality rather than resorting to exploitative practices. Junk fees generate significant revenue for industries like transportation, banking, and hospitality, and they can artificially inflate prices. While in some competitive markets, these fees may not increase the total amount consumers pay, in less competitive markets, they can lead to higher costs for consumers. Additionally, these fees can disproportionately affect low-income households and people of color. The administration is urging federal agencies to find ways to reduce or eliminate these fees and has already taken actions that will save consumers and businesses billions of dollars.
