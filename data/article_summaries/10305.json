In a press briefing by Jeff Bader, the NSC Senior Director for Asian Affairs, it is stated that President Hu and President Obama met for about an hour and a half and had a positive and constructive conversation. They discussed ways to expand their interests and responsibilities in dealing with global challenges, specifically non-proliferation and the global economic recovery. They agreed on the need for concrete actions on these issues to develop a partnership. The two leaders discussed the Iranian nuclear program at length and agreed to instruct their delegations to work on a sanctions resolution with the P5-plus-1 and U.N. Security Council representatives. The meeting also addressed the global economic situation, with President Obama emphasizing the importance of China moving towards a more market-oriented exchange rate and addressing market access barriers. Additionally, President Obama informed President Hu about the tragedy in West Virginia and called for a moment of silence to remember the miners who lost their lives.
