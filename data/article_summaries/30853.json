The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has released a report highlighting the economic costs of malicious cyber activity on the U.S. economy. The report emphasizes that cyber threats are constantly evolving and can come from sophisticated adversaries. It also states that due to common vulnerabilities, security breaches occur across firms in patterns that are difficult to predict. The report suggests that cyberattacks and cyber theft create externalities that discourage private sector investment in cybersecurity. It further notes that firms in critical infrastructure sectors can have particularly large negative effects on the wider economy. The report emphasizes the importance of accurate data and cooperation between firms and the public sector in effectively protecting against cyber threats.
