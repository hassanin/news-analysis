President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. has declared a major disaster in the State of Arkansas due to severe storms and tornadoes that occurred on March 31, 2023. This declaration allows for Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts. Affected individuals in the counties of Cross, Lonoke, and Pulaski can receive assistance, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. State and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, can also receive Federal funding for emergency work in these counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide can be funded on a cost-sharing basis. Mr. Roland W. Jackson of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are still ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated later. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362).
