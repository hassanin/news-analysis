President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed May 2019 as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month in the United States. This proclamation highlights the importance of physical fitness and sports in uniting Americans and promoting active and healthy lifestyles. The benefits of exercise and sports go beyond physical health, as they also improve mental health, teach valuable life skills, and foster camaraderie and friendship. The proclamation emphasizes the role of coaches, parents, and teachers in breaking down barriers to youth participation in sports and empowering young people to reach their full potential. It also addresses the decline in youth sports participation and directs the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition to develop a national strategy to increase participation. The strategy aims to increase awareness of the benefits of sports and physical activity, promote good nutrition, and recruit individuals to support youth participation through coaching, mentoring, teaching, and offering athletic and nutritional programs. The strategy also focuses on providing accessible and inclusive physical activity opportunities for all Americans, including girls, youth with disabilities, and those from economically distressed areas. The proclamation encourages individuals to prioritize physical activity and sports participation in their lives, recognizing the countless benefits they provide.
