President Donald J. Trump has issued a full pardon to I. "Scooter" Lewis Libby, the former Chief of Staff to Vice President Richard Cheney. Libby was convicted in 2007 but had his sentence commuted by President George W. Bush. Despite this, Libby paid a fine, performed community service, and served probation. In 2015, a key witness against Libby recanted her testimony, stating that the prosecutor had withheld important information during interviews. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals reinstated Libby to the bar in 2016, agreeing that he had presented credible evidence of his innocence. Before his conviction, Libby had served honorably in various government roles. President Trump believes that Libby has been treated unfairly and hopes that the pardon will rectify this.
