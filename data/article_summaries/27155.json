Jim Carroll, the newly sworn-in Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), has released the Administration's National Drug Control Strategy. The strategy aims to address the challenge of drug trafficking and use and reaffirms President Trump's commitment to aggressively tackling the opioid crisis. The plan focuses on saving American lives, educating the public about the dangers of drug abuse, providing help to those struggling with addiction, and stopping the flow of illegal drugs across the borders. Jim Carroll was nominated by the President on April 24, 2018, confirmed by the Senate on January 2, 2019, and sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence during a ceremony in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.
