The White House has announced that President Obama will be hosting a Leader's Summit on Refugees on September 20, 2016. The co-hosts for the summit include Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden, and the UN Secretary General. These co-hosts have pledged to work together to advance the objectives of the summit, including increasing financing for global appeals and international humanitarian organizations, doubling the global number of resettled refugees, and increasing the number of refugees worldwide in school and granted the legal right to work. The summit aims to address the challenges faced by the international community in protecting and assisting refugees, as well as recognizing new and significant commitments made by UN member states in 2016. The United States, along with its partners, is committed to being a humanitarian leader and addressing the current level of displacement, which is the highest since World War II.
