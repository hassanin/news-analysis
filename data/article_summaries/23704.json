White House and Department of Homeland Security officials met with law enforcement officials to discuss the need for immigration reform. The principles of the President's proposal include strengthening border security, cracking down on employers who hire undocumented workers, creating a pathway to earned citizenship, and streamlining the legal immigration system. Secretary Napolitano highlighted the Department's work with local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws and secure the borders. There has been significant progress in reducing illegal border crossings and seizing illegal items along the Southwest border. Immigration reform is seen as a way to strengthen trust between communities and law enforcement agencies and allow officers to focus resources on public safety. The meeting included several law enforcement officials from across the country. Secretary Napolitano recently visited San Diego, California and Clint and El Paso, Texas to inspect border security operations and discuss efforts to secure the border while facilitating lawful travel and trade.
