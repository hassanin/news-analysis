Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared on NBC's Meet the Press to discuss the state of the economy and debunk the misperception that it is exclusively based on GDP. She emphasized that the technical definition of a recession takes into account a broad range of data, and based on the current data, she believes the economy is not in a recession. Yellen highlighted the strong labor market, with the creation of almost 400,000 jobs a month, as evidence of a healthy economy. She also acknowledged that the economy is slowing down, but explained that this slowdown is necessary and appropriate for steady and sustainable growth. Yellen mentioned that consumer spending remains solid, industrial output has grown in five of the six most recent months, and household balance sheets are generally in good shape. However, she expressed concerns about high inflation and stated that the Federal Reserve is working to bring it down. The Biden Administration is also taking actions to lower prices for the American people, including cutting the deficit, releasing gas from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower gas prices, and working towards passing a bill to lower prescription drug costs and maintain current levels of healthcare costs.
