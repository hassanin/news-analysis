Small-business confidence is at a record high in 2018 due to optimism among small-business owners about the recently passed tax-reform package. According to the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey, the Q1 Small Business Confidence Index saw a five-point increase, reaching a record high of 62. This is the largest quarter-to-quarter move the index has seen since its inception. The survey also found that more small-business owners now expect positive effects from tax policy changes, with 46 percent saying it will have a positive impact, up from 38 percent in the previous quarter. In addition, the National Small Business Association reported that over half of small-business owners believe the national economy is doing better than it was six months ago, and 59 percent anticipate economic expansion in the next year.
