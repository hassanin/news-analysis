It highlights the leadership and activism of survivors in shaping VAWA and the need to bring an intersectional lens to address the unique barriers faced by marginalized communities.

It also mentions the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2021, which includes provisions that respond to the voices of survivors and advocates by extending protections to Native American victims of sexual violence, stalking, trafficking, child abuse, elder abuse, and assault against law enforcement. The article concludes by highlighting the urgency of VAWA reauthorization, particularly in light of the pandemic and economic crisis, and calls for a commitment to preventing sexual assault and upholding the rights of all people to live free from sexual violence.
