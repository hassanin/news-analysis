On March 22, 2018, the President signed a memorandum outlining steps to protect domestic technology and intellectual property from discriminatory trade practices by China. This was in response to a report by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative on China's practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. The United States will continue efforts to protect its technology and intellectual property, prevent non-economic transfers to China, and improve access to the Chinese market. The United States also wants China to remove trade barriers, including non-monetary ones, that make it difficult and unfair to do business there. Discussions with China will continue to address these issues, with the goal of resolving long-standing structural problems and increasing exports by eliminating import restrictions imposed by China.
