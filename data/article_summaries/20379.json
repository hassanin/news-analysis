President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Kansas due to severe storms and flooding that occurred between September 2-12, 2016. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, facility repairs or replacements, and hazard mitigation measures. Christian M. Van Alstyne has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the area, and additional designations may be made if necessary.
