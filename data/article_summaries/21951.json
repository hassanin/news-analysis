President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 16, 2014, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 11 through May 17, 2014, as National Transportation Week. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of infrastructure to the economy, security, and way of life. He urges Congress to pass transportation and waterways bills that provide at least 4 years of funding for infrastructure repairs and investments, and in the meantime, he is taking executive action to streamline the permitting process for key projects. He also highlights the role of infrastructure in America's security, stating that it allows first responders and service members to quickly reach emergency scenes and ensures the swift transportation of food and aid during natural disasters. President Obama calls for the modernization of transportation infrastructure and the utilization of the nation's labor force to tackle these challenges. He concludes by calling upon all Americans to recognize the importance of transportation infrastructure and acknowledge the contributions of those who build, operate, and maintain it.
