President Barack Obama has declared October 2013 as National Substance Abuse Prevention Month. The proclamation aims to raise awareness about the dangers of substance abuse and encourage Americans to engage in programs and activities that promote comprehensive substance abuse prevention efforts in their communities. The theme for this year's campaign is "Learn it! Live it!", emphasizing the importance of learning about the impact of substance use on communities and setting a positive example for families and neighbors. The proclamation highlights the link between substance use disorders and crime, motor vehicle crashes, and fatalities. It also mentions the administration's commitment to stopping drug use before it begins through evidence-based national and community-focused prevention programs. The proclamation emphasizes the role of adult role models in preventing youth substance abuse and calls on parents, schools, health officials, law enforcement professionals, faith-based organizations, workplaces, the recovery community, and all Americans to join in the effort. The proclamation also mentions the expansion of substance use disorder and mental health benefits through the Affordable Care Act and encourages those without health insurance to sign up for coverage.
