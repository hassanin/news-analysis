Vice President Kamala Harris has announced the release of the PAVE Action Plan, which aims to address racial and ethnic bias in home appraisals. The plan, developed by the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE), includes a range of reforms to promote equity in the home appraisal process. Home appraisals play a crucial role in the homebuying and lending process, but bias in these valuations limits the ability of Black and brown families to benefit from homeownership and contributes to the racial wealth gap. Studies have shown that eliminating racial disparities in home equity would significantly narrow this wealth gap. The PAVE Action Plan outlines commitments and actions that can be taken using existing federal authorities to ensure fair and accurate home valuations for all communities. The Task Force will continue its work and seek collaboration with various stakeholders to address this issue.
