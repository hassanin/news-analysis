In this article, President Barack Obama is transmitting an alternative plan for pay increases for civilian Federal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay systems in January 2016. He explains that Title 5, United States Code, authorizes him to implement alternative pay plans if he views the adjustments that would otherwise take effect as inappropriate due to a national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare. The President has determined that for 2016, across-the-board pay increases will be 1.0 percent. He will also make a decision by November 30, 2015, regarding an alternative plan for locality payments. These decisions are not expected to significantly impact the ability to attract and retain a well-qualified Federal workforce. The adjustments will take effect on the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
