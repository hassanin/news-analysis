The President's jobs plan has been praised by Randi Weingarten, the President of the American Federation of Teachers. Weingarten believes that the plan will help solve economic problems and rebuild the nation. She emphasizes the importance of investing in jobs and programs that will benefit the education system, infrastructure, and public services. Weingarten also stresses the need to prioritize education, as there has been a significant loss of education jobs and delayed school repairs in recent years. She applauds the plan for putting teachers back in the classrooms and saving money on energy costs that can be reinvested in education. Weingarten supports the President's approach of closing corporate tax loopholes and asking the wealthiest individuals to pay their fair share. She calls on Congress to pass the jobs package quickly and praises the leadership shown by President Obama on this issue.
