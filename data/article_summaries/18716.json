First Lady Michelle Obama visited Fort Jackson in South Carolina to learn about the consequences of childhood obesity and poor nutrition on military readiness. She was briefed by military leaders on the health issues faced by new recruits and the Army's efforts to address them. The First Lady toured the post's dining facilities to learn about the "Fueling the Soldier" nutrition initiative and spoke with soldiers about their experiences. The Army sees the effects of childhood obesity on young adults, including higher rates of bone injury and dental care costs. The military is also facing a growing number of young Americans who are too overweight to join. Fort Jackson's nutrition program focuses on providing soldiers with fresh and flavorful "high performance foods" and swapping out unhealthy options in vending machines and dining facilities. This program, combined with physical activity, helps prepare the Armed Forces to be strong and ready to serve.
