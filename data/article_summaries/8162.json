The article discusses the success of efforts to lower healthcare costs and increase access to affordable health insurance in the United States. It states that nearly 11.5 million Americans signed up for insurance on HealthCare.gov between November 1st and December 15th, marking an 18 percent increase compared to the previous year. This enrollment period is an all-time record, and it does not even include those who signed up through state marketplaces. The article highlights that these achievements have helped reduce the uninsured rate to eight percent, the lowest in history. Additionally, it mentions that four out of five people signing up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act can find coverage for $10 or less per month. The Inflation Reduction Act has allowed for the extension of these lower rates, saving millions of Americans an average of $800 annually. Starting January 1st, the article mentions that additional cost-saving measures will be implemented, such as capping the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 per month and Medicare beneficiaries not having to pay out-of-pocket for recommended adult vaccines. Furthermore, prescription drug companies will be required to pay Medicare a rebate if they raise their prices faster than inflation for drugs administered at a doctor's office. The article concludes by encouraging readers to visit HealthCare.gov by January 15th, 2023, to take advantage of the lower rates and sign up for healthcare for the upcoming year.
