CVS Caremark, one of the largest retailers and pharmacies in America, has decided to stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products in its stores. This decision is part of a national campaign to help millions of Americans quit smoking. President Obama applauds this move and believes it will help reduce tobacco-related deaths, cancer, heart disease, and healthcare costs. He congratulates and thanks the CEO of CVS Caremark, Larry Merlo, the board of directors, and everyone involved in making this choice, as it will have a positive impact on the health of the country.
