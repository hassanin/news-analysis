Second Lady Karen Pence, along with Congressman Don Bacon and Mrs. Angie Bacon, visited Boys Town and the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)/Nebraska Medicine to highlight the organizations' work in supporting and transforming the lives of children and addressing mental health issues, particularly in veterans. At Boys Town, they learned about the organization's care, treatment, and education programs for at-risk youth, as well as the Boys Town National Hotline, which provides crisis support for children, including those experiencing suicidal thoughts. They also received an overview of Boys Town's art therapy program for deaf and hard of hearing children. At UNMC, they were briefed on the Behavioral Health Education Center of Nebraska, which focuses on veteran suicide prevention and traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment. UNMC is conducting a three-year study on suicide prevention among veterans in Nebraska. Mrs. Pence emphasized the importance of addressing veteran suicide prevention and her involvement with PREVENTS, an initiative to enhance suicide prevention efforts in the United States. They also toured UNMC's Healing Arts program at the Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, exploring artwork and healing gardens. The visit aimed to raise awareness about mental health services for vulnerable veterans and provide support to youth in crisis in the Omaha community.
