Second Lady Karen Pence, along with Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia, traveled to Jacksonville, Florida to launch the Department of Labor's Transition Employment Assistance for Military Spouses (TEAMS) Program. The program aims to assist military spouses in their career endeavors by providing them with training on employment essentials tailored to their unique circumstances. It will offer free two-hour workshops focused on job search techniques, networking opportunities, and developing an action plan. Mrs. Pence also visited K9s For Warriors, the nation's largest provider of Service Dogs to military veterans, and a military spouse and veteran-owned business called Social Grounds Coffee. She recognized the challenges faced by military spouses in finding employment due to frequent moves, varying state requirements, and a high unemployment rate. Mrs. Pence has been advocating for more fulfilling career opportunities for military spouses since 2018.
