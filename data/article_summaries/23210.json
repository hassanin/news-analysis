President Obama received an update on the oil spill response efforts from Secretaries Chu, Napolitano, and Salazar, as well as Administrator Jackson, National Incident Commander Allen, and Carol Browner. Based on new information and analysis, Secretary Chu and other scientists concluded that the well integrity test should proceed with modifications and safety requirements. Admiral Allen will issue a new directive to BP for the test, which will include additional seismic testing, monitoring from ROVs, and periodic assessments. The test will take up to 48 hours and will be followed by containment efforts using new equipment. The federal government will gain valuable data on the well's condition and our capacity to shut it in if needed for a hurricane.
