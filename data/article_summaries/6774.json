The Biden-Harris Administration has announced policy changes to the U.S. Anti-Personnel Landmine policy. The United States is joining the majority of countries in committing to limit the use of anti-personnel landmines due to their disproportionate impact on civilians, especially children, even after conflicts have ended. This change aligns U.S. policy with the Ottawa Convention, an international treaty that prohibits the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. The United States will also pursue solutions to become compliant with and eventually accede to the Ottawa Convention while maintaining the ability to respond to contingencies and meet alliance commitments. However, the policy change does not apply to the Korean Peninsula due to security concerns for the Republic of Korea. The United States is a leader in humanitarian mine action and has provided significant financial support for land clearance, medical rehabilitation, and vocational training in over 100 countries. This assistance has helped post-conflict countries rebuild and reintegrate survivors of mine incidents into society.
