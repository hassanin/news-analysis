In honor of Transgender Day of Visibility, the Biden-Harris Administration is celebrating transgender communities, especially transgender kids and their families, and highlighting their resilience in the face of anti-transgender laws. The Administration has taken historic steps to advance equality, dignity, and safety for transgender Americans. However, conservative politicians have advanced numerous anti-transgender laws across the country, putting the rights of trans Americans at risk. The White House hosted a Roundtable on Affirming Transgender Kids to hear directly from transgender children and their parents about their experiences. The Biden Administration is announcing additional steps to support transgender Americans. These include strengthening civil rights protections, ensuring access to accurate IDs and government services, supporting transgender service members and veterans, addressing homelessness among transgender Americans, expanding access to gender-affirming health care, addressing anti-transgender violence, promoting transgender equality at home and abroad, supporting transgender public servants, improving data collection on gender identity and sexual orientation, and promoting visibility and inclusion for transgender Americans. The Biden Administration has consistently uplifted the voices and stories of transgender Americans through various initiatives and events.
