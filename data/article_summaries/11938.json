Twelve nations, including Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Georgia, Hungary, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Romania, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam, have agreed on a joint statement announcing the elimination of highly enriched uranium (HEU) from within their borders. These nations highlight the security measures and financial costs associated with possessing HEU and the benefits of using low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel for research reactors and experiments. They express appreciation to Russia, the United States, and the International Atomic Energy Agency for their assistance in converting research reactors to LEU fuel and removing HEU. The removed material will be secured until it is disposed of or downblended to LEU for civilian purposes. The nations also applaud other countries that have eliminated HEU and encourage all countries to minimize their HEU stockpiles, with the aim of eliminating all HEU before the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in 2016.
