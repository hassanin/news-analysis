President Barack Obama has issued a memorandum stating that the United States will continue to provide drug interdiction assistance to the government of Colombia. The memorandum cites the need for interdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking in Colombia's airspace due to the significant threat it poses to the country's national security. It also states that Colombia has appropriate procedures in place to minimize the risk of innocent loss of life during these interdictions. The Secretary of State has been instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register and notify Congress.
