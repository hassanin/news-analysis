In a recent Cabinet Room meeting, President Trump addressed the humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border of the United States. He emphasized the prevalence of human trafficking and drug smuggling, and the need for a powerful wall or steel barrier to stop it. The President stated that he has the right to declare a national emergency to fund the wall, but wants Congress to take action first. He also mentioned the need for major immigration reform. Several individuals at the meeting, including sheriffs, pastors, and a county supervisor, shared stories about the impact of illegal immigration and drug trafficking on their communities. They expressed support for the construction of a border wall to enhance security and protect American citizens. The President criticized the media for not reporting on the dangers and crimes occurring at the border, and urged the Democrats to come back to Washington and vote for border security. He indicated that if Congress fails to act, he may declare a national emergency.
