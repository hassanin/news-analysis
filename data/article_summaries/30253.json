President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Veterans Comprehensive Prevention, Access to Care, and Treatment (COMPACT) Act of 2020," which amends various authorities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Act focuses on transition assistance from military to civilian life, suicide prevention and care, and improvement in care and services for women veterans. However, two provisions in the Act require the VA Secretary to evaluate whether additional legislative action is necessary to implement or expand programs related to information sharing and mental health education. President Trump states that he will treat these provisions in a manner consistent with his discretion as President. Additionally, Title II of the Act requires the VA to establish or expand mental health services for eligible veterans and provide or pay for emergency suicide care at a VA facility or an external facility. However, the Act does not require the providers of this care to have any relationship with the VA, potentially leading them to seek payment from sources other than the VA. President Trump assures that his administration will work to ensure Title II meets the needs of veterans, but calls on Congress to be prepared to act if additional legislation is required to address implementation challenges.
