President Barack Obama sent a letter to the Speaker of the House regarding the War Powers Resolution Report for Libya. The letter was in response to an attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the death of four U.S. citizens, including Ambassador John Christopher Stevens. In order to protect American citizens and property, a security force from the U.S. Africa Command was deployed to Libya, and an additional security force was sent to Yemen in response to security threats. These forces will remain in both countries until the security situation improves. President Obama stated that these actions were taken to fulfill his responsibility to protect U.S. citizens and in line with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The letter was provided to Congress to keep them informed, as required by the War Powers Resolution. President Obama expressed his appreciation for the support of Congress in these actions.
