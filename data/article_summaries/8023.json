On September 26, 2022, representatives from countries across the Western Hemisphere gathered at the White House to launch the implementation process of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. The Declaration, which was announced by President Biden and other heads of state at the Summit of the Americas in June, aims to address the challenges of irregular migration and forced displacement in the region. The participating countries reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of the Declaration and agreed to work together on a shared implementation plan. The US government outlined the progress it has made on its commitments under the Declaration, including disrupting human smuggling networks, increasing opportunities for labor migration, and supporting countries that host large migrant populations. The participating countries will continue to coordinate their efforts at an upcoming meeting in Lima, Peru on October 6.
