On May 16, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation regarding the adjustment of tariffs on steel imports. The proclamation states that the Secretary of Commerce had previously found that steel imports threatened to impair the national security of the United States. In March 2018, the President imposed a 25% ad valorem tariff on steel imports from most countries. In August 2018, the Secretary informed the President that although steel imports had declined, they were still higher than desired and capacity utilization in the domestic steel industry had not reached the target level. As a result, the President decided to adjust the tariff by imposing a higher rate on steel imports from Turkey. The Secretary has now informed the President that steel imports have declined and capacity utilization has improved to the target level, so the higher tariff on steel imports from Turkey is no longer necessary. Therefore, the President has decided to remove the higher tariff on steel imports from Turkey and impose a 25% ad valorem tariff, the same rate as other countries. The proclamation also includes modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to reflect these changes.
