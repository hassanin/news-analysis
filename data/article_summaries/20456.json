The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a fact sheet on U.S. assistance to the Central African Republic (CAR) in response to the recent atrocities committed against civilians. The U.S. is providing up to $101 million to support the restoration of security in CAR. This includes airlift support, defense services for French forces, and funding for the African-led International Support Mission to CAR (MISCA). The U.S. is also providing humanitarian assistance, including funding for the World Food Program and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Efforts are being made to promote conflict mitigation, reconciliation, and peacebuilding in CAR, including funding for interreligious peacebuilding efforts and community radio programs. The U.S. supports accountability for perpetrators of atrocities and will assist in the work of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry. The State Department is also providing funding to support access to justice for survivors of gender-based violence. The U.S. plans to increase its presence in CAR through regular visits and the reopening of the Embassy in Bangui.
