The article discusses the issue of surprise medical billing in the healthcare system. It highlights a case where a woman, Elizabeth Moreno, was charged an exorbitant amount of $17,850 for a drug test. The test was sent to an out-of-network lab without her knowledge, resulting in a bill that experts consider to be significantly higher than usual market prices. This incident and similar experiences have prompted President Trump to address the problem and protect Americans from surprise medical billing. Many patients have faced the frustration of receiving bills for services they were unaware of, provided by out-of-network providers they never met, at prices that exceed insurance coverage.
