The National Security Advisor, Susan E. Rice, issued a statement condemning North Korea's recent missile launch, which follows closely after its nuclear test in January. Rice described the launch as destabilizing, provocative, and a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. She emphasized that North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs pose serious threats to the interests of the United States and its allies, as well as undermine peace and security in the region. Rice also criticized North Korea's prioritization of these programs over the well-being of its people and called for the international community to unite in imposing serious consequences on North Korea for its reckless actions. The United States is fully committed to the security of its allies in the region and will take necessary steps to defend itself and respond to North Korean provocations.
