President Trump made remarks at Joint Base Andrews before departing for Arizona to visit Honeywell, a company that has been involved in pandemic response efforts. When asked about new projections that show more people will die if the country reopens quickly, the President emphasized that those projections are without mitigation measures, and that the country wants to reopen. He encouraged people to think of themselves as warriors and expressed confidence in beating the economic numbers soon.

Regarding his visit to Arizona, the President mentioned that he loves Arizona and has had success there in the past. He also expressed his respect for Honeywell. When asked if he would wear a mask at the plant, he stated that he would wear one if it's a mask environment.

The President was also asked about a recent ad by the Lincoln Project, a group of Republicans critical of him. He called them "major losers" and suggested they change their name to the "Losers Project." He listed his accomplishments, such as appointing conservative judges and achieving tax cuts, and criticized individuals in the group. He concluded by saying they should not call it the Lincoln Project, as it is not fair to Abraham Lincoln.
