The United States welcomes the European Union's decision to prohibit all Iranian crude oil imports and implement sanctions on Iran's oil industry. This demonstrates the commitment of our European allies to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The United States and the European Union are dedicated to holding Iran accountable for not meeting its international obligations. The EU's actions highlight the international community's seriousness in dealing with Iran's nuclear ambitions. This decision is an important part of our diplomatic efforts to give Iran a clear choice between isolation or meeting its obligations. Iran now has the opportunity to engage in substantive negotiations and must take concrete steps to address the international community's concerns about its nuclear activities.
