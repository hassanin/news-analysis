On National Public Lands Day, President Biden celebrates the beauty and importance of America's public lands. These lands, including national parks, monuments, wildlife refuges, and more, are invaluable sources of recreation, education, and inspiration for Americans across the country. National Public Lands Day, which has been observed since 1994, brings together volunteers to restore and protect these essential spaces. Projects include building bridges and trails, restoring ecosystems, and removing invasive species. In addition, all federally managed public lands and waters offer free admission on this day. The Biden Administration is committed to conserving these lands and waters, with initiatives such as the creation of a Civilian Climate Corps and the "America the Beautiful" initiative, which aims to conserve 30% of the nation's lands and waters by 2030. Public lands have provided solace during the COVID-19 pandemic, and as the country recovers, President Biden encourages Americans to support their local public lands through volunteerism and service. The administration also aims to improve equitable access to nature for all Americans. President Biden proclaims September 25, 2021, as National Public Lands Day and invites all Americans to join him in a day of service for public lands.
