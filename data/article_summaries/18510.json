President Obama will welcome President Park Geun-hye of the Republic of Korea to the White House on October 16. This visit will highlight the strong partnership between the U.S. and South Korea and the close ties between the American and Korean people. The two leaders will discuss various topics, including security, economics, and global issues. They will also explore new areas of cooperation, such as environment, energy, space, health, and cybersecurity. The current security situation on the Korean Peninsula, particularly the threat from North Korea, will also be a topic of discussion. President Park's visit was rescheduled from June.
