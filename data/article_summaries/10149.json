On November 21, 2012, President Obama pardoned the National Thanksgiving Turkey in a ceremony in the Rose Garden. The turkeys, named Cobbler and Gobbler, were 19-week old, 40-pound turkeys raised in Rockingham County, Virginia. The names were chosen from submissions from elementary schools in the area. This year, the American public voted via the White House Facebook page to decide which turkey would be pardoned. After the ceremony, the turkeys were taken to George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens for display. Later, they would live in a custom-made enclosure at Mount Vernon's livestock facility. President Obama's family also received two dressed turkeys from Jaindl's Turkey Farm in Pennsylvania, which would be donated to a local food bank.
