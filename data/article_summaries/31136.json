In a proclamation issued on April 28, 2017, President Donald Trump declared April 30 through May 6, 2017, as National Charter Schools Week in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of empowering students and giving parents the freedom to choose their children's education. It recognizes the successful public charter schools in the country and the individuals and communities who invest in the education of children. The proclamation highlights the idea that charter schools, which operate independently from traditional school boards, have the potential to generate better outcomes for students by allowing educators to experiment with new teaching methods. It also emphasizes the need for educational opportunity to be accessible to all children, regardless of their status, income, or residence. The proclamation states that the one-size-fits-all approach to education has not worked for many students and emphasizes the benefits of allowing families the freedom to choose alternative schooling options, such as charter schools. The demand for charter schools is growing, with 44 states and the District of Columbia having laws that allow for charter schools, enrolling over 3 million students. The proclamation cites a study by Stanford University's Center for Research on Education Outcomes, which shows that students in urban charter schools achieve significantly greater outcomes in reading and math. President Trump calls on Congress to increase funding for charter schools and school choice programs for disadvantaged youth, particularly African American and Latino children. The proclamation concludes by stating the importance of education in providing opportunities for a better future and the need to support the success of charter schools.
