The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a new four-year $17.5 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Ukraine. This program is supported by a series of economic reforms that the Ukrainian government and central bank have committed to implementing. The approval of this program reflects both the determination of Ukraine to lay a foundation for strong economic growth and the international community's commitment to providing financial assistance to stabilize Ukraine's economy. The United States is working with other countries to support Ukraine financially as it implements these reforms to transform its economy and strengthen its democracy.
