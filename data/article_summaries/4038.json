In a speech delivered at the East Room, Vice President Kamala Harris commemorated the anniversary of the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, which took the lives of four young girls. She praised the courage and leadership of Brandon, a survivor of a violent tragedy, and thanked him for representing the voices of many. Harris acknowledged the collective resilience, compassion, and commitment to action demonstrated by the families of the victims, civic and community leaders, and members of the clergy. She highlighted that the bombing aimed to instill fear and discourage the fight for civil rights but instead united people across America. Harris mentioned the surge in hate-fueled violence in recent years and emphasized the need to prevent, respond to, and recover from such acts. She discussed her visits to Buffalo, where she witnessed both heartbreak and determination, and announced the administration's commitment to developing a coordinated federal response to support communities affected by violence. Harris called for a whole-of-society effort involving various stakeholders to address hate-fueled violence. She stated that no one should fight alone and emphasized the importance of unity. Harris concluded by expressing confidence in the nation's ability to build a better future and urged everyone to stand firm in the belief that they have more in common than what separates them.
