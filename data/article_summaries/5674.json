A federal Idaho district court has ruled that women in Idaho will continue to have access to life-saving emergency care, including abortion care. The court found that Idaho's ban on abortion, which was set to go into effect, would prevent women from receiving necessary care during emergencies and would be in violation of the federal law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. This ruling is seen as a victory for women's health in Idaho. However, just a day prior, a Texas court made a decision that could deny women in that state access to the same life-saving care, potentially putting their lives at risk. Republican legislators are being criticized for denying women's access to healthcare and attempting to limit their rights and autonomy. The President is committed to protecting women's access to life-saving healthcare and will take action to ensure this.
