The supplemental consolidated report, addressed to the Speaker of the House and the President, provides an update on military operations conducted by the United States Armed Forces in support of counterterrorism efforts. The report highlights deployments of forces to various regions, including the United States Central and Africa Commands' areas of responsibility. The primary mission of US military personnel in these locations is to facilitate counterterrorism operations of foreign partner forces and does not typically involve routine engagement in combat. However, US forces may be required to defend themselves against threats or attacks and are equipped with appropriate weapons and equipment for force protection. The report also mentions ongoing military operations against al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and associated forces, as well as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The United States has successfully degraded ISIS capabilities in Syria and Iraq, and additional measures will be taken if necessary to protect US interests. The report further provides information on specific deployments in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, East Africa, the Lake Chad Basin and Sahel Region, Cuba, the Philippines, Egypt, and Kosovo. The deployments in these regions are carried out in coordination with partner nations and are aimed at countering terrorist threats and promoting regional stability. The report concludes by stating that the deployment of US Armed Forces is authorized under the Commander in Chief's constitutional and statutory authority, and regular communication is maintained with congressional leadership and relevant committees regarding these deployments.
