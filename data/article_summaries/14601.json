Congressman Teague from southern New Mexico supports President Obama's proposal to extend tax breaks for the middle class, provide tax relief for small businesses and workers, and extend unemployment insurance. He believes that allowing middle-class tax breaks to expire during the fragile economy will hinder job creation and slow economic growth. While he has concerns about extending tax cuts for wealthy Americans in the long term, he emphasizes that these extensions are temporary and part of a larger package that includes maintaining tax cuts for the middle class, a new payroll tax cut, key tax cuts for small businesses, and other benefits such as earned income and child credits and higher education credits. Congressman Teague believes that extending these tax cuts will benefit working families and small businesses, and he calls on the President and Congressional leadership to prioritize fiscal responsibility and avoid raising taxes on American small businesses and workers.
