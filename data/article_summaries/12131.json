The article discusses a joint statement by Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and the United States on the minimization of Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) for civilian purposes. The four countries reaffirm their commitment to minimize the use of HEU and ensure a reliable supply of medical isotopes for patients in need. They acknowledge that HEU is sensitive and requires special precautions due to its potential use in nuclear explosive devices. The countries emphasize the importance of security measures at all facilities using HEU, including medical isotope production facilities. Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, in cooperation with the United States, express their determination to support the conversion of European production industries to non-HEU-based processes by 2015. This will eliminate the use of HEU for medical isotopes produced in these countries. Until the conversion is complete, the United States is prepared to supply the necessary HEU target material to ensure uninterrupted production of medical isotopes for diagnosing heart disease, cancer, and studying organ structure and function.
