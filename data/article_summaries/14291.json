President Obama has signed an emergency declaration for the State of Michigan in response to contaminated water in the area. This declaration authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to save lives and protect property and public health. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency, including water, water filters, and test kits. The federal assistance will be provided at 75 percent federal funding and will last for a period of no more than 90 days. The President has also offered assistance from other federal agencies to support the recovery effort. David G. Samaniego has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
