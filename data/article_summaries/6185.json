The Biden Administration has announced that it will facilitate the air shipment of approximately 1.5 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula from England to New York from September 1 to 5. These flights are part of Operation Fly Formula, which aims to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure its availability in stores. The Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, the General Services Administration, and the Department of Defense are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets US health and safety standards. By September 5, Operation Fly Formula will have transported over 85 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the US. The Biden Administration has also taken other measures to ensure an adequate supply of safe infant formula, including invoking the Defense Production Act and issuing guidance for the safe importation of formula that is not currently being produced for the US market.
