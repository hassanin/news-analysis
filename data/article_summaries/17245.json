The United States and the European Union (EU) are working together to protect their citizens against terrorist attacks. They collaborate in the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) to address counterterrorism threats and build international capacity. They focus on Africa, specifically the Horn of Africa and Sahel regions, to enhance law enforcement, criminal justice, border security, and counter terrorist financing. The US and EU also support GCTF-inspired institutions, such as Hedayah, which focuses on countering violent extremism (CVE), the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund, which supports grassroots efforts to counter violent extremism, and the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law, which trains criminal justice officials in Africa. They cooperate in countering violent extremism and foreign fighters, aiming to provide positive alternatives, counter terrorist narratives, and build government and civil society capacity. They also work on preventing the travel and financing of terrorist organizations through critical agreements.
