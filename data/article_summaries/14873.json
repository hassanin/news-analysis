Vice President Joe Biden has delivered the Cancer Moonshot report to President Obama and the American public. The report summarizes the work of the Cancer Moonshot Task Force since its creation in January and lays out the Vice President's strategic plan for transforming cancer research and care. The report also includes the Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel's identified areas of scientific opportunity. The report also includes new commitments from both the public and private sectors towards the goals of the Cancer Moonshot. Some of these commitments include a collaboration between the National Cancer Institute, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft to build a sustainable model for maintaining cancer genomic data in the cloud, the Department of Defense establishing a groundbreaking new study to transform our understanding of the biological basis of cancer, and Lyft and Uber expanding their support of affordable, reliable transportation for cancer patients. These new actions and partnerships are just some of the over 70 commitments made this year as a result of the Cancer Moonshot. The goal of the Cancer Moonshot is to double the rate of progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
