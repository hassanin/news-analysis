The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to governing the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare to improve outcomes while ensuring security and privacy. In response to this commitment, leading healthcare providers and payers have announced voluntary commitments to the safe and responsible use of AI in healthcare. These commitments align with the "FAVES" principles, which state that AI should lead to fair, appropriate, valid, effective, and safe healthcare outcomes. The companies commit to informing users when content is largely AI-generated and not reviewed by people and to monitoring and addressing any harms caused by AI applications. They also pledge to develop AI solutions that advance health equity, expand access to care, reduce clinician burnout, and improve the patient experience. The article emphasizes the importance of mitigating risks associated with AI, such as errors in clinical decisions, biases in diagnoses, and privacy risks. However, if these risks are addressed, AI has the potential to benefit patients, doctors, and hospital staff by improving care quality, cutting costs, and enabling more informed health choices. Examples of AI applications in healthcare include analyzing medical images, streamlining drug development, and reducing clinician burnout through automation. The Biden-Harris Administration has engaged with stakeholders in the healthcare sector to understand the benefits and risks of AI and prioritize equity and accessibility in healthcare discussions. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been tasked with advancing safe and trustworthy AI through frameworks, policies, and potential regulatory actions. The private-sector commitments announced by healthcare providers and payers are seen as a critical step in advancing AI for the health and wellbeing of Americans.
