Vice President Biden stated that while there is still a long way to go, he is encouraged by the economic indicators released today. Consumer confidence has improved, spending increased last month, and benefits from the Recovery Act, such as relief payments and tax credits, boosted disposable personal income by $17 billion in May. The Vice President emphasized that job growth is still needed, but sees these early signs as evidence that the Recovery Act is providing stability for families and businesses and creating conditions for economic recovery.
