The article discusses the U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement and the associated action plan. President Obama is committed to pursuing a trade agenda that will open new markets and support the economy and jobs. The goal is to create a level playing field that benefits U.S. workers, companies, farmers, and ranchers while ensuring acceptable working conditions and labor rights in trading partners. The Obama Administration has worked with Colombia to address labor concerns, resulting in an agreed "Action Plan Related to Labor Rights." The swift implementation of this plan by Colombia has cleared the way for the U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement to move forward to Congress. The agreement is expected to expand U.S. goods exports by over $1.1 billion and provide duty-free access for key U.S. goods and services in various sectors. It is also projected to increase U.S. GDP by $2.5 billion and support additional U.S. jobs.
