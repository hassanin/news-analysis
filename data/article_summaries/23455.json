National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice has issued a statement on the Chibok girls, who were abducted in Nigeria six months ago. The United States has expressed its commitment to supporting Nigeria's efforts to bring the girls home safely. The US has provided assistance in investigations, deployed personnel on the ground, facilitated strategic communications, and aided the families. These efforts are part of a broader support to Nigeria's counterterrorism strategy, which includes the rule of law and strengthened security institutions. The US will continue to work towards the release of all the remaining girls, while also celebrating the freedom of those who have managed to escape Boko Haram. The US also pledges to stand with girls everywhere who seek education and their universal rights and freedoms.
