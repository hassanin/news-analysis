On April 12, 2010, President Barack Obama declared a national emergency with respect to Somalia due to the deterioration of the security situation and the persistence of violence in the country, as well as acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia. This national emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In 2012, additional steps were taken to address the national emergency, including the export of charcoal from Somalia, the misappropriation of Somali public assets, and acts of violence against civilians. The national emergency declared in 2010, along with the measures adopted in 2012, will continue in effect beyond April 12, 2016, as the situation in Somalia continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This continuation of the national emergency was done in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
