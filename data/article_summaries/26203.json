President Donald J. Trump's Administration has implemented new sanctions targeting Russian individuals and entities in an effort to confront destabilizing and malicious behavior by Russia. These actions are in response to Russia's sustained global campaign to undermine the sovereignty and security of the United States and its allies. President Trump has taken steps to call out and confront Russian efforts to undermine the United States, and is strengthening alliances and standing up to Russia's malign influence worldwide. It is important for Americans to come together and not allow those seeking to sow confusion, discord, and rancor to be successful.
