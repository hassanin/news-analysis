This article is a message from former President Barack Obama to Congress regarding the continuation of the national emergency on Russian fissile material. The National Emergencies Act states that a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and transmits it to Congress stating that the emergency will continue. In accordance with this provision, President Obama has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the emergency declared in Executive Order 13617, regarding the disposition of Russian highly enriched uranium, will continue beyond June 25, 2013. The President believes that the risk of nuclear proliferation posed by the accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in Russia continues to be a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, thus necessitating the continuation of the national emergency.
