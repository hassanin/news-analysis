The Partnership for Sustainable Communities, consisting of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has awarded grants to support livable and sustainable communities across the country. The grants, totaling $409.5 million, aim to connect housing with good jobs and transportation, and consider the impact on the environment. The agencies have worked together over the past year to promote better outcomes for communities and more effective federal investments. The grants will boost economic development and help create communities with access to employment, schools, and transportation options. The Partnership focuses on coordinating federal investments in infrastructure, facilities, and services to meet economic, environmental, and community objectives. The grants were judged by a multidisciplinary review team, reflecting a new collaboration between agencies. The aim is to create sustainable communities with affordable housing and access to transportation options to rebuild the foundation for prosperity in the country.
