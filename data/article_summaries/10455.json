In this article, President Barack Obama issues a memorandum regarding the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 (CSPA). He determines that it is in the national interest of the United States to waive the application of the prohibition in section 404(a) of the CSPA with respect to Rwanda, Somalia, and Yemen. He also partially waives the prohibition with respect to the Central African Republic, allowing for the provision of International Military Education and Training (IMET). Additionally, he partially waives the prohibition with respect to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, allowing for the provision of IMET, nonlethal Excess Defense Articles, licenses for direct commercial sales of U.S. origin nonlethal defense articles, Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) assistance, and support provided pursuant to section 1208 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. Finally, he partially waives the prohibition with respect to South Sudan, allowing for the provision of PKO assistance and support provided pursuant to section 1208 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. The President authorizes and directs the submission of this determination to Congress and its publication in the Federal Register.
