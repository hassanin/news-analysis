During the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, President Biden expressed the United States' commitment to working with the African Union and African partners to accelerate progress in achieving food security. He announced an additional $2.5 billion in emergency aid and medium to long-term food security assistance for resilient African food systems and supply markets. This builds upon over $11 billion in U.S. humanitarian and food security assistance for this year alone. President Biden also launched a strategic partnership on food security between the United States and the African Union. The goal is to leverage public and private sectors, multilateral development banks, and international financial institutions to make sustainable investments in resilient food systems. The compounding impacts of the global pandemic, climate crisis, high energy and fertilizer costs, and conflicts have pushed weak supply chains to the brink and increased malnutrition and food insecurity, particularly in African countries. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to responding to immediate humanitarian needs while also investing in medium- and long-term resilient food systems and supply markets.
