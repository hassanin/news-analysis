On March 15, 1995, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency with respect to Iran due to the threat it posed to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This was followed by several executive orders imposing sanctions on Iran. The President has taken additional steps to address this national emergency through various executive orders issued between 2010 and 2020. The actions and policies of the Government of Iran, including its development of weapons capabilities, regional aggression, support for terrorist groups, and the activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, continue to pose a threat to the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 1995 is being extended for another year. This is a separate emergency from the one declared in 1979 in connection with the hostage crisis. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
