President Obama has signed a bill, S. 3261, Contract Awards for Large Air Tankers, which supports the Forest Service in contracting the next generation of air tankers for wildfire suppression. This bill is particularly important as there are currently damaging wildfires burning in Western states. The National Interagency Fire Center is coordinating resources from various federal agencies to supplement state and local resources in responding to these fires. The President's administration is committed to supporting state and local responders and is ready to provide additional resources if needed. FEMA has also approved Fire Management Assistance Grants to assist firefighting efforts in Colorado and New Mexico. Overall, the bill and ongoing efforts aim to modernize the air tanker fleet and enhance wildfire suppression capabilities.
