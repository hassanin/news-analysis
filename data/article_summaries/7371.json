German Chancellor Angela Merkel will be visiting the White House for an official working visit, aiming to strengthen the bilateral ties between the US and Germany. The visit will focus on addressing shared global challenges and strengthening cooperation in areas such as climate change, COVID-19 response, security challenges, regional issues, and democracy promotion. The economic and security aspects of the US-Germany relationship will also be discussed, highlighting Germany's role as a trading partner and NATO ally. The issue of Nord Stream 2, a controversial gas pipeline project between Russia and Germany, is expected to be raised, but no formal announcement or deliverable is anticipated. The US supports a TRIPS waiver for COVID-19 vaccine intellectual property rights, and while President Biden and Chancellor Merkel share a commitment to COVAX, no major breakthroughs are expected on this issue. President Biden has previously spoken with Ukrainian President Zelensky about Russia's aggression and Nord Stream, and a White House meeting between the two leaders is still planned for this summer. The US will seek to engage Germany in addressing the challenges posed by China, including non-market practices, human rights abuses, and intellectual property protection. The US-Germany relationship will be further solidified through the release of the Washington Declaration, and plans for a Futures Forum, an economic dialogue, and a climate and energy partnership.
