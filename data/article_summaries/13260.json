President Obama has signed an emergency declaration for H1N1 flu, declaring a national emergency in order to be prepared in case of a rapid increase in illness that may overburden healthcare resources. This declaration allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to temporarily waive certain standard federal requirements, enabling healthcare facilities to implement emergency operations plans to deal with the H1N1 influenza pandemic. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is also authorized to temporarily waive or modify certain requirements of Medicare, Medicaid, State Children's Health Insurance programs, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule in response to the pandemic.
