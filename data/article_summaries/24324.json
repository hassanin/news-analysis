President Obama has proclaimed October 2016 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. In his proclamation, he highlights the importance of addressing domestic violence and supporting its survivors. Although rates of domestic violence against females have decreased, there is still much work to be done, as nearly 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men have experienced domestic violence. The Obama administration has taken steps to combat domestic violence, such as proposing funding for domestic violence response and passing legislation like the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act and the Violence Against Women Act. The administration has also promoted data collection on domestic violence offenses, workplace policies to address domestic violence, and non-discrimination in housing for survivors. The proclamation emphasizes the need to challenge harmful stereotypes and recognize survivors who experience disproportionate rates of domestic violence. The National Domestic Violence Hotline is provided as a resource for those in need of assistance. The proclamation calls on all Americans to speak out against domestic violence and support local efforts to help victims.
