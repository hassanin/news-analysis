First Lady Michelle Obama will be participating in Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day at the White House on Wednesday, April 20th. She will meet with children of Executive Office employees as well as young people from organizations such as Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, SchoolTalk, and the D.C. Child and Family Services Agency. The White House is also encouraging other employers to open their doors to local youth participants, including foster youth, youth with disabilities, and children who may not have a parent with a job that allows them to bring their children to work. This initiative is a collaboration between the White House Council on Women and Girls and the My Brother's Keeper Initiative, aimed at providing work-based learning opportunities to young people nationwide.
