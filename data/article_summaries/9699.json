The White House Press Secretary released a statement on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project Inc. The Court's decision affirmed that the Fair Housing Act allows Americans to challenge not only intentionally discriminatory laws and policies, but also those that have an unjustified discriminatory effect. The statement emphasizes that many Americans experience more subtle forms of discrimination, such as predatory lending, exclusionary zoning, and development policies that limit affordable housing. The decision recognizes that discrimination often operates in hidden forms and upholds an important method for challenging and eliminating such practices to end housing discrimination.
