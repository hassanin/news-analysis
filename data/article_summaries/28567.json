On May 17, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order on energy and environmental performance in executive departments and agencies. The order states that agencies should meet statutory requirements in a way that increases efficiency, optimizes performance, eliminates unnecessary use of resources, and protects the environment. The order sets goals for agencies to achieve and maintain reductions in building energy use, meet renewable energy requirements, reduce water consumption, utilize performance contracting, conform to building energy efficiency requirements, implement waste prevention and recycling measures, acquire products and services in accordance with purchasing preference mandates, and track and report on energy management activities. The order also establishes various duties for the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Federal Chief Sustainability Officer, and the heads of agencies. The order revokes a previous executive order on federal sustainability planning and provides limitations and exemption authority for certain activities.
