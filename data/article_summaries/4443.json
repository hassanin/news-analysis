The Biden-Harris Administration is taking new executive actions to promote safe storage of firearms and reduce gun violence, particularly among children. Gun violence is the leading cause of death for children in America, and approximately 4.6 million children live in homes with unsecured firearms. Safe storage of firearms can significantly decrease the risk of self-inflicted harm and unintentional shootings among children. These actions aim to physically prevent youth from accessing firearms and reduce gun violence in schools and communities. The administration is also calling on Congress to pass a national safe storage law and is working with state and local leaders on safe storage efforts. Additionally, the administration has provided funding for safe learning opportunities, mental health services, and mental health professionals in high-need communities to address the broader issue of student safety and well-being.
