The White House has announced that Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in the United States. This initiative aims to ensure that taxpayers receive the appropriate revenues from the extraction of natural resources. Secretary Salazar will collaborate with industry and civil society to develop a plan for disclosing relevant information about revenues from oil, gas, and mining assets, and to improve the transparency and accountability of revenue collection efforts. This move is part of the United States' commitment to open government and making the government more accountable to the American people. Secretary Salazar has a strong track record of working with industry and citizens to reform the management of natural resources.
