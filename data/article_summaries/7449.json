The author is urging state and local governments to disburse Emergency Rental Assistance funds immediately as the eviction moratorium deadline approaches. They highlight that these funds have been available since February and that an additional $21.5 billion has been passed in the American Rescue Plan. The author emphasizes that there is no excuse for any government not to accelerate the distribution of these funds to landlords and tenants affected by the pandemic. They urge governments to work with courts, community groups, and legal aid to ensure that people do not face eviction if they have not sought out Emergency Rental Assistance funds. The author also mentions that there is no legal barrier to implementing a moratorium at the state and local level. They conclude by stating that both the author's administration and state and local governments should not rest until Emergency Rental Assistance reaches those in need.
