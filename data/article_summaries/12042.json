The Presidential Policy Directive on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience aims to strengthen and maintain secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure in the United States. The directive establishes national policy on critical infrastructure security and resilience and outlines the roles and responsibilities of various federal departments and agencies. The policy emphasizes the need for proactive efforts to manage risk, reduce vulnerabilities, and minimize the consequences of incidents on critical infrastructure. It also calls for collaboration between the federal government, state and local entities, and public and private owners and operators of critical infrastructure. The directive identifies energy and communications systems as uniquely critical and highlights the importance of integrating and analyzing information to inform decision-making and planning related to critical infrastructure. The implementation of the directive involves refining functional relationships, enabling efficient information exchange, and implementing an integration and analysis function for critical infrastructure. The directive also designates 16 critical infrastructure sectors and identifies sector-specific agencies responsible for their security and resilience.
