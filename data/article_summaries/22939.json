The article is a statement from Press Secretary Robert Gibbs on the President's commitment to America's veterans. The President has proposed the largest increase in the VA budget in 30 years and has had meetings with VSO and MSO leaders to discuss the budget proposal. The administration was considering third-party billing to maximize resources for veterans, but after concerns were raised by VSOs, the President has decided to drop the consideration. The President wants to maintain a constructive partnership with VSOs and MSOs who have worked with him on the budget proposal.
