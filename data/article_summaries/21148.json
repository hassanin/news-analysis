President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring December 15, 2016, as Bill of Rights Day in the United States. The Bill of Rights, consisting of the first 10 Amendments to the Constitution, was ratified on December 15, 1791, and has protected fundamental liberties such as freedom of speech, worship, and assembly, as well as the rights to trial by jury and due process. The proclamation acknowledges that the Bill of Rights initially safeguarded personal liberties for some, but not all, and highlights the efforts of courageous Americans throughout history to extend these rights to more people. It emphasizes the importance of each generation recommitting to protecting these freedoms and working towards justice and equality. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to observe Bill of Rights Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
