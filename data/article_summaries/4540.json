President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Arkansas due to severe storms and tornadoes that occurred on December 10 and 11, 2021. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The counties of Craighead, Jackson, Mississippi, Poinsett, and Woodruff are eligible for federal funding, which can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to assist individuals and business owners in recovering from the disaster. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Jerry S. Thomas has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing in other areas, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance starting tomorrow through online registration or by calling the provided toll-free numbers.
