The United States Administration has released a new National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking to address the issue that affects an estimated 25 million people globally and generates $150 billion in illicit profits each year. The plan focuses on addressing the needs of underserved individuals, families, and communities, and aims to combat systemic injustices, particularly experienced by marginalized groups. It also emphasizes the importance of workers' rights and ending forced labor in global supply chains, which has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan highlights the need for collaboration across government agencies, as well as with state and local governments, the private sector, and non-governmental partners. Survivor voices and recommendations are central to the plan, which incorporates input from survivor-led groups to inform anti-trafficking policies and strategies. The plan retains a focus on prevention, protection, prosecution, and partnerships as the foundational pillars of anti-trafficking efforts. The Administration expresses gratitude to community leaders, service providers, businesses, activists, and individuals with lived experience for their efforts in combating human trafficking and calls for continued collaboration to improve responses to the issue.
