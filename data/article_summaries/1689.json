Fiji has become the 14th nation and the first in the Pacific Islands to join the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) as a founding member. This move is welcomed by President Biden, who sees it as reflecting the regional diversity of the Indo-Pacific. The IPEF now includes members from Northeast and Southeast Asia, South Asia, Oceania, and the Pacific Islands. The united commitment among these nations is to promote a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. Fiji, being a close partner to the United States and a leader in the region, will bring valuable perspectives on tackling the climate crisis and building a clean economy that generates well-paying jobs. The future of the 21st century economy is expected to be shaped in the Indo-Pacific, and the IPEF aims to drive sustainable growth for all member economies. The United States expresses gratitude to Prime Minister Bainimarama and looks forward to strengthening the partnership for the benefit of both countries, the Pacific Islands, and the Indo-Pacific region.
