The Trump administration's infrastructure plan includes support for traditional transportation needs like roads, bridges, mass transit, railroads, waterways, and airports, as well as broadband internet, water and power systems, public lands, and veterans hospitals. The plan calls for $200 billion in federal spending to generate at least $1.5 trillion in new investment from state, local, and private sources. One highlight of the plan is that 25% of the direct federal funding will be set aside for rural projects in cities and towns with a population of 50,000 or less. The proposal also includes regulatory reforms to expedite project review and permitting processes. There is bipartisan consensus that something needs to be done to address the nation's infrastructure system, and the Trump administration is commended for its efforts to reinvest in the infrastructure.
