Second Lady Karen Pence joined Vietnam Marine Veteran Terry Sharpe, also known as "The Walking Marine," for the last leg of his eighth and final walk from Stokesdale, North Carolina to Washington D.C. Mrs. Pence walked with Terry from the Washington Monument to the White House, where they were greeted by President Trump and Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie. Terry's mission is to raise awareness of the current veteran suicide rate, which is 22 per day, as well as veteran hunger and homelessness, which are correlated to the suicide rate. Mrs. Pence expressed the importance of bringing attention to this issue and supporting those who have served the nation.
