In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims May 2012 as Jewish American Heritage Month. He highlights the history of Jewish Americans, starting with a group of 23 Jewish refugees who fled Brazil 358 years ago and found a safe haven in what is now New York City. Despite facing hardship and hostility, Jewish Americans persevered and contributed greatly to the country. They fought for equality and workers' rights, preached against racism, marched for civil rights, and served heroically in battle. President Obama calls upon all Americans to learn more about the heritage and contributions of Jewish Americans and to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
