This article discusses executive orders issued by President Donald Trump on June 14, 2019, regarding advisory committees. The orders require each executive department and agency to evaluate the need for their current advisory committees and terminate at least one-third of them by September 30, 2019, if certain conditions are met. Agencies may request a waiver from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget if they believe it is necessary. Additionally, the combined total number of eligible committees across all government agencies is limited to 350, and agencies may not establish new advisory committees unless a waiver is obtained. The article also addresses reporting requirements, the role of the Office of Management and Budget, exemptions for merit review panels, and general provisions.
