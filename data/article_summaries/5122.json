Vice President Harris will announce a Presidential Memorandum in Florida to mark the 50th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. The memorandum, issued by President Biden, aims to protect access to reproductive healthcare services. It emphasizes the need to protect access to mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortion that has been approved by the FDA for over 20 years. The FDA recently allowed the continued use of telehealth to prescribe mifepristone and created a new option for certified pharmacies to dispense it. Some state officials have tried to prevent access to medication abortion, prompting the President to take action. The memorandum announces various measures to address barriers faced by patients, providers, and pharmacies in accessing or providing medication abortion safely and legally. The Attorney General and the Secretaries of HHS and DHS will provide recommendations on additional ways to address these barriers.
