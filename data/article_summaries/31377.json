President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring May 10-16, 2020, as National Charter Schools Week. The proclamation recognizes the contributions of public charter school leaders, teachers, students, and parents and emphasizes the commitment to expanding access to public charter schools and high-quality education opportunities throughout the country. The proclamation highlights the importance of individual choice in education and the need to provide learning environments that meet the unique needs of students. It also acknowledges the disproportionate benefits that public charter schools provide to low-income students and students of color. Despite the significant growth in public charter school enrollment, there are still over 1 million students on waitlists. The Trump Administration has invested $1.5 billion in the development of public charter schools and aims to restore local control over education and expand access to high-quality education options. The proclamation calls on states and communities to support charter schools as an important school choice option.
