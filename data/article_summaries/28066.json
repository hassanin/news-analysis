President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have affirmed the importance of a strong trade and economic relationship between the United States and Japan. They aim to expand trade and investment in a mutually beneficial manner and promote free, fair, and open development of the global economy. The two countries will enter into negotiations for a United States-Japan Trade Agreement on goods and other key areas including services. They also plan to have discussions on other trade and investment items. The agreement is designed to be mutually beneficial, and the two governments will respect each other's positions during the negotiations. The United States and Japan will also cooperate to protect American and Japanese companies and workers from non-market oriented policies and practices by third countries. They will work together to promote discussions on World Trade Organization reform, e-commerce, and address unfair trading practices such as intellectual property theft and trade-distorting subsidies. Both countries will conduct these discussions based on mutual trust and refrain from taking measures against the spirit of the joint statement. They will also make efforts to resolve tariff-related issues promptly.
