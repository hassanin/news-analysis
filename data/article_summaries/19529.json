The White House has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Syrian government. The declaration, originally made in 2004, has been modified and relied upon for additional steps taken over the years. The Syrian regime's war on its own people, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, support for terrorist organizations, and obstruction of the Lebanese government pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The US condemns the regime's violence and human rights abuses and calls for a political transition in Syria. The future of the national emergency will depend on changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Syrian government.
