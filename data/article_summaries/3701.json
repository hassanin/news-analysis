President Biden has ordered an amendment to the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act Declaration to expand the eligibility of medical professionals and health care students to serve as COVID-19 vaccinators. The amendment allows dentists, veterinarians, midwives, optometrists, paramedics, physician assistants, podiatrists, respiratory therapists, and recently retired members of these professions to administer vaccines. Additionally, medical students, nursing students, and students of other eligible health care professions with proper training and supervision are also authorized to serve as vaccinators. The Biden Administration has also launched an online portal for health care professionals, retirees, and students to check their eligibility to administer the vaccine and volunteer in their state. Federal departments and agencies are deploying their own health care and support personnel to help increase the national vaccinator workforce.
