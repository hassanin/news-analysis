The United States labor market had a successful year in 2017. The economy added 2.1 million jobs, with manufacturing seeing a significant increase of 16,000 jobs per month. This fulfilled President Trump's campaign promises and brought the unemployment rate for manufacturing workers to a record low of 2.6 percent in November 2017. Other sectors such as construction, wholesale trade, and mining and logging also saw bigger job gains compared to 2016. The overall unemployment rate dropped to 4.1 percent, the lowest in 17 years, benefiting veterans, African-Americans, and Hispanics with historic low unemployment rates. Although there were reductions in retail and federal government employment, these reflect changing shopping patterns and efforts to streamline government operations. In 2018, tax reform is expected to lead to more job and wage gains, tighter labor market conditions, and increased labor force participation. Higher wages should encourage non-participants to enter the labor market, potentially bringing back an additional 1.7 million Americans to work. The President's focus on economic growth will continue in 2018, with a goal of supporting American workers through less regulation, more jobs, and higher wages.
