In recognition of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. expresses support for those diagnosed with breast cancer and honors those who have lost their lives to the disease. Breast cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women, with an estimated 1 in 8 women developing it in their lifetime. The President highlights the importance of fighting for a cure and ensuring access to quality care for all Americans. He emphasizes the significance of early detection through regular screenings, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare services. President Biden calls for the continuation of scheduled screenings, doctor appointments, and treatments while following coronavirus safety measures. He acknowledges the progress made in cancer research and advocates for the creation of an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health at the National Institutes of Health (ARPA-H) to invest in breakthroughs for cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. The President's American Rescue Plan expands access to affordable health insurance coverage, removing financial barriers to screenings and treatments. He also highlights the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in expanding coverage and preventive services for women, including mammograms. President Biden reaffirms his commitment to protecting and building on the ACA and addressing the health disparities faced by Black women. The proclamation encourages individuals, organizations, and government agencies to participate in activities that raise awareness about breast cancer prevention and control. The President concludes by expressing solidarity with breast cancer survivors and applauding the efforts of advocates, medical professionals, researchers, and caregivers.
