The Vice President's visit to Thailand reinforces the United States' commitment to the stability, peace, prosperity, and sustainable development of the Mekong sub-region through cooperation with Mekong-region countries. The Vice President is convening civil society leaders involved in climate action and environmental protection, as well as business leaders involved in the clean energy transition, to advance work in the Mekong sub-region. New funding is being announced to support clean energy, connectivity, and sustainable economic development in the Mekong sub-region. This announcement builds on previous support for the protection of the environment and sustainable use of natural resources in the Mekong sub-region. The Vice President also intends to request up to $20 million in additional funding to the Japan-U.S.-Mekong Power Partnership (JUMPP), which aims to support the Mekong sub-region's pursuit of energy security, clean energy integration, and resilience. Since its establishment in 2019, JUMPP has expanded partnerships with Mekong countries to build competitive and connected energy markets and infrastructure. The program assists Mekong countries in achieving their clean energy transition goals and enhancing regional interconnection. Technical assistance is provided to support renewable energy projects, including modernizing regulations and market mechanisms, and ensuring stability and reliability. The expansion of renewable energy generation capacity in the Mekong sub-region helps diversify the electricity mix and reduce reliance on hydropower. JUMPP aims to ensure citizens have access to reliable, secure, and affordable energy supplies to support economic growth and prosperity.
