The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a fact sheet on U.S.-ASEAN relations. The United States and ASEAN have been partners for nearly 40 years, working together on goals of stability, prosperity, and peace in Southeast Asia. The decision was made to elevate this relationship to a strategic partnership, marking a new era of even stronger cooperation. The United States is committed to this partnership for the long run and continues to deepen and broaden engagement with ASEAN. The United States and ASEAN have jointly undertaken various activities and programs, including support for the ASEAN Economic Community and programs to strengthen people-to-people ties. U.S.-ASEAN cooperation is also supporting sustainable growth and a strengthened rules-based system to address regional challenges like climate change, human trafficking, and maritime security. The United States has five priority areas for engagement with ASEAN, including increasing economic cooperation, expanding maritime cooperation, cultivating the emerging leaders of ASEAN, promoting opportunity for women in ASEAN, and addressing transnational challenges. The fact sheet provides details on the initiatives and programs in each of these priority areas.
