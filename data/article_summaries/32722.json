President Trump made remarks before departing for Pittsburgh, addressing various topics including his upcoming Supreme Court nominee announcement, the COVID-19 death toll, and the importance of having nine justices in the Supreme Court. He stated that he is close to making a final decision on the nominee and will announce it on Saturday. When asked about the 200,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S., Trump expressed his belief that if the country had not taken the necessary measures, the death toll could have been much higher. He also criticized China for not preventing the spread of the virus. Trump did not comment on the possibility of hitting another 200,000-death milestone. He refused to disclose who he has met with regarding the Supreme Court nominee but stated that the decision is nearing and there is a lot of paperwork to do. When asked about concerns that the nomination could divide the country, Trump dismissed the idea and emphasized the importance of having nine justices, particularly in light of the unsolicited mail-in ballots that he believes are part of a Democratic hoax. He stated that he has a constitutional obligation to nominate a justice and expressed confidence in the person he will choose.
