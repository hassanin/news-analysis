President Obama has declared a major disaster in Puerto Rico as a result of Tropical Storm Maria, which occurred between September 8-14, 2011. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The municipalities of Juana Díaz, Naguabo, and Yabucoa are eligible for federal funding, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to assist individuals and business owners in recovering from the disaster. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Justo Hernández as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling FEMA's toll-free numbers.
