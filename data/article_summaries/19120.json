In this presidential memorandum, President Barack Obama suspends the limitations set forth in the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 for a period of 6 months. The Act required the relocation of the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The President determines that this suspension is necessary to protect the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to transmit this determination to Congress, along with a report, and to publish the determination in the Federal Register. The suspension will take effect after the transmission of this determination and report to Congress.
