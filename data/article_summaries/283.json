The Biden-Harris Administration is focused on delivering for the Latino community by expanding access to healthcare, lowering drug prices for seniors, providing student debt relief, creating well-paid jobs, and lowering Hispanic unemployment rates. They have signed into law three historic pieces of legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the American Rescue Plan (ARP), and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), to ensure greater opportunity for all, including Latinos. These efforts have led to record drops in unemployment for Latino workers, historically low credit card delinquency rates, low foreclosures and evictions, and low Latino child poverty rates. The administration is also working on building an economy that works for Latino families, combatting climate change, improving health outcomes, supporting small businesses, advancing equity and economic opportunity, improving education, and reforming the immigration system. They have launched initiatives to advance equity and justice for underserved communities, diversified the federal court system, and appointed barrier-breaking Latino leaders to key positions.
