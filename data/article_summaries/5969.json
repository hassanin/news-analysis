The Biden-Harris Administration has secured commitments from 20 internet providers to lower high-speed internet costs for American families. These commitments are part of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), created as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The ACP allows households to reduce their internet service costs by up to $30/month (or $75/month on Tribal lands). The administration has worked with leading providers, covering over 80% of the U.S. population, to either increase speeds or cut prices, ensuring that ACP-eligible households can access high-speed internet plans for no more than $30/month. The administration is also launching efforts to ensure that as many eligible households as possible take advantage of the program. This announcement is part of President Biden's strategy to lower the cost of high-speed internet for all Americans, which includes grant programs for broadband infrastructure construction, new rules for affordable internet options, and increased competition in the market. The ACP is the largest high-speed internet affordability program in U.S. history, with an estimated 48 million households qualifying for the program.
