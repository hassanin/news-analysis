According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of job openings in the US reached a record high of 7.3 million in December. This indicates the strength of the labor market. The private sector accounted for 6.7 million of these job vacancies, also a record high. The construction industry saw a significant increase in new job posts, with 382,000 recorded. Over the past three months, the economy has been adding an average of 241,000 net new jobs per month, more than double the amount needed to keep up with population growth and reduce unemployment. As a result, more people are finding employment, with the total employment rate for prime-age workers (ages 25-54) reaching 79.9% in January, the highest since the financial crisis.
