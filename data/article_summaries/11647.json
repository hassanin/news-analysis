In this presidential memorandum, President Barack Obama certifies that the U.S. will continue providing drug interdiction assistance to the government of Colombia. The president states that interdiction of suspected drug trafficking aircraft in Colombia's airspace is necessary due to the significant threat posed by drug trafficking to the country's national security. He also mentions that Colombia has appropriate procedures in place to minimize the risk of innocent loss of life during interdiction operations, including effective means to identify and warn aircraft before using force against them. The Secretary of State is instructed to publish this determination and inform Congress accordingly.
