In recognition of National Youth Substance Use Prevention Month, President Joe Biden emphasizes the importance of preventing substance use among young Americans. He acknowledges the challenges posed by the overdose epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic, which have taken a toll on families and communities across the nation. The administration is committed to implementing evidence-based strategies to prevent substance use and intervene early to protect the health and safety of young people. This includes supporting programs that educate young individuals about the risks of drug and alcohol use, as well as the life-saving power of naloxone. Preventing substance use during adolescence significantly reduces the likelihood of developing a substance use disorder later in life. Additionally, investing in effective prevention programs today can yield significant cost savings in the future by avoiding potential medical expenses and boosting productivity. The bipartisan Unity Agenda has made combating the opioid epidemic a priority, and the administration has allocated significant funds to expand mental health and substance use services, increase social workers in schools, and support Drug-Free Communities coalitions. The president also emphasizes the need for Medicaid funding to support mental health and substance use care in schools, as well as the importance of achieving parity between physical and mental health care. President Biden calls on parents, educators, community members, and others to reach out to young people, share information, and promote healthy lifestyles. The proclamation designates October 2022 as National Youth Substance Use Prevention Month, urging everyone to take action and implement evidence-based prevention strategies to improve the nation's health.
