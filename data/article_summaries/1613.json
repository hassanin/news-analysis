President Joseph R. Biden has issued an executive order to phase out the federal government's reliance on privately operated criminal detention facilities. The order acknowledges that the current system of mass incarceration in the United States disproportionately affects people of color and imposes significant costs on society. The aim is to reduce profit-based incentives for incarceration and prioritize rehabilitation and redemption in the nation's correctional systems. The order also highlights the need to ensure safe and humane treatment for individuals in the federal criminal justice system and improve conditions for correctional staff. The Attorney General is directed not to renew Department of Justice contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities. The order is to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
