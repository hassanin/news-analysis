Karen Pence, the Second Lady of the United States, recently visited Tracy's Kids at Methodist Children's Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. During her visit, she had the opportunity to paint with the kids and learn about the importance of art therapy to them. She received a painting of the Statue of Liberty from a 10-year-old patient and expressed her gratitude for the art therapy program. Pence also mentioned a patient who spends 95% of her day doing art therapy and how it helps her get out of her room. She praised the work of "Miss Courtney" and the community in San Antonio for supporting the art therapy program. Pence is passionate about art therapy and plans to share stories about her visits to promote the practice both nationally and internationally.
