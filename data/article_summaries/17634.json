In a press conference, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest addressed questions about the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State. Earnest confirmed that no one at the White House received advance notice of FBI Director Comey's comments on the investigation. He also stated that the White House has gone to great lengths to avoid interfering with the investigation and that the President's views on the matter are irrelevant. Earnest declined to comment on whether the President believes Clinton's handling of classified information was careless. He also stated that the President and Clinton are not discussing the FBI investigation or its findings. Regarding the trip on Air Force One, Earnest stated that it is a political trip and the Democratic National Committee will reimburse the federal government for the costs associated with President Obama's political activities. Earnest also addressed questions about the President's involvement in the vice presidential selection process and stated that the President would be willing to advise Clinton on the matter if she asked for his input. Finally, Earnest addressed criticism of Director Comey's decision not to recommend criminal charges against Clinton, stating that Comey is capable of defending himself and that he has a well-established reputation for putting politics aside in his official responsibilities.
