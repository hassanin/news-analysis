President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in Hawaii due to the emergency conditions caused by Hurricane Douglas. This declaration authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to alleviate the hardship and suffering of the local population. FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide necessary equipment and resources to mitigate the impact of the emergency. The assistance provided will include direct federal assistance and reimbursement for mass care, such as evacuation and shelter support, at 75 percent federal funding. Dolph A. Diemont has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
