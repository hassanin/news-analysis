Vice President Kamala Harris has announced the Biden-Harris Action Plan for Building Better School Infrastructure, which aims to upgrade public schools with modern, energy-efficient facilities and transportation. The plan will leverage investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and American Rescue Plan to implement solutions like energy efficiency retrofits and electric school buses. Outdated heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in many schools can affect student health and performance, while dirty diesel buses pose additional health risks. The plan will save schools money, as energy efficiency improvements can lead to significant savings. The Department of Energy has launched a $500 million grant program for energy improvements in public school facilities. The plan also includes resources, technical assistance, and recognition to support schools in their efforts. Additionally, the administration is investing in cleaner school buses and safer school transportation routes to reduce pollution and improve children's health. The plan also addresses support for rural, tribal, and Puerto Rican schools, as well as training and workforce development opportunities.
