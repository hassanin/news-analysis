The White House is partnering with eleven East Coast governors to launch a Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership. The partnership aims to accelerate the offshore wind industry, provide cleaner and cheaper energy, create jobs, and invest in American energy supply chains, manufacturing, shipbuilding, and servicing. As a first step, the White House and governors will collaborate on expanding the offshore wind supply chain, including manufacturing facilities, port capabilities, and workforce development. The Administration is also advancing a National Offshore Wind Supply Chain Roadmap and designating offshore wind vessels as Vessels of National Interest. President Biden has set a goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030, creating jobs, and attracting private investments. The East Coast states have already committed to procuring nearly 40 GW of offshore wind, providing a strong demand signal for clean energy. The Partnership will expand to include West Coast and Gulf of Mexico governors as offshore wind projects develop in those regions.
