On June 11, 2009, President Obama signed a disaster declaration for the State of Alaska due to flooding and ice jams that occurred starting on April 28, 2009. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Assistance includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and businesses recover. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis for eligible governments and nonprofit organizations. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional counties may be designated for assistance. Residents and business owners can apply for assistance online or by calling FEMA.
