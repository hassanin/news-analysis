The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new actions to support the conversion of high-vacancy commercial buildings into residential use. These actions include new financing, technical assistance, and the sale of federal properties. The goal is to create affordable, energy-efficient housing that is located near public transportation and job opportunities while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The increase in office and commercial vacancies has placed a strain on the real estate market and local economies. Additionally, there is a shortage of affordable housing units, driving up rental costs. The actions announced today are part of the White House Housing Supply Action Plan, which aims to lower housing costs, increase housing supply, and promote fair housing. They also align with the administration's efforts to lower energy costs and address climate change. The administration is encouraging states, localities, and the private sector to take action and use available resources to facilitate the conversion of commercial buildings into residential units.
