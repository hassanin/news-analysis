The White House is proposing new fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas pollution standards for cars. The program will start in 2012 and by 2016, the fleet average will be 35.5 miles per gallon, four years earlier than required by the CAFE law. The program aims to increase fuel efficiency by an average of 5% per year. The projected oil savings over the life of the program is 1.8 billion barrels of oil, and it is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 900 million metric tons. The proposal combines the legal authority of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and California's authority under the Clean Air Act. The car companies and California have agreed to support the proposal. The government is not planning to directly motivate consumers to switch to more fuel-efficient cars, but believes that the new standards will lead to more fuel-efficient options for consumers. The proposal will go through the normal rulemaking process and is subject to notice and comment.
