President Obama declared a major disaster in the state of Georgia due to severe storms and flooding. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The funding will assist individuals and business owners with grants for temporary housing, home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Gracia B. Szczech was named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
