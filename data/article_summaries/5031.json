The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an economic crisis in the United States, with millions of Americans unemployed and struggling with food insecurity. Communities of color are disproportionately affected by this crisis. President Biden has unveiled a legislative package and issued an executive order to provide economic relief to working families. The executive order includes measures to address the hunger crisis, ensure equitable delivery of direct payments, protect workers' health, and improve access to relief resources. Additionally, President Biden is recommending immediate action to improve wages, benefits, and bargaining rights for federal workers and contractors. These steps aim to provide relief during the pandemic and lay the foundation for a strong and equitable recovery.
