President Biden and Vice President Harris have announced their support for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, which is the largest long-term investment in infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. The framework includes investments in clean transportation infrastructure, clean water infrastructure, universal broadband infrastructure, clean power infrastructure, remediation of legacy pollution, and resilience to climate change. It invests two-thirds of the resources proposed in President Biden's American Jobs Plan. The president believes that this investment will create good-paying union jobs, tackle the climate crisis, and grow the economy sustainably and equitably. President Biden sees this as a critical step in demonstrating that American democracy can deliver results and position the United States to compete and win in the 21st century. While more work needs to be done, President Biden remains committed to his comprehensive agenda and will work with Congress to build on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework. The financing for the framework comes from closing the tax gap, redirecting unspent emergency relief funds, targeted corporate user fees, and the macroeconomic impact of infrastructure investment. President Biden calls on Congress to pass the framework and make his full Build Back Better vision a reality.
