During President Biden's visit to Tampa, Florida, he will emphasize his commitment to protecting and strengthening Medicare and Social Security, as well as lowering prescription drug prices. This is in contrast to the plans of Congressional Republicans, who have a history of attempting to cut these programs, privatize them, and raise the retirement and eligibility ages. Just last week, House Republicans introduced legislation to repeal President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which would result in higher prescription drug prices, subsidies for pharmaceutical companies, and increased taxes for millions of people. President Biden has consistently advocated for the protection of Medicare and Social Security, as well as reducing healthcare costs for working families. He has called on Congress to continue building on the progress made and ensure the future stability of these programs.
