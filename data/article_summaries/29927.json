The article discusses a series of executive orders issued by President Donald Trump regarding the awarding of military decorations. The orders pertain to various medals and awards, such as the Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, Coast Guard Cross, Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star Medal, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, Soldier’s Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Medal, Airman’s Medal, and Coast Guard Medal. The orders outline the criteria for receiving these awards and specify the authority of the Secretary of the military department concerned, or the Secretary of Homeland Security in the case of the Coast Guard, to award these medals on behalf of the President. The orders also address regulations, time limitations, and the posthumous awarding of the Distinguished Flying Cross. It is important to note that these orders do not invalidate any previous military decorations and do not create any new legal rights or benefits.
