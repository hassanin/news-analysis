The Obama Administration has launched new energy efficiency efforts aimed at saving money for consumers and businesses while creating new jobs and strengthening American competitiveness. The announcement includes major changes to energy conservation standards for household and commercial lighting equipment, which could save consumers billions of dollars annually and reduce CO2 emissions. Additionally, a $346 million investment will be made to accelerate the development and use of energy-efficient technologies in commercial and residential buildings. The goal is to make buildings up to 80% more efficient and reduce carbon emissions. The funding will support research, development, and deployment of advanced building systems, residential buildings, commercial buildings, appliance market transformation, and solid-state lighting.
