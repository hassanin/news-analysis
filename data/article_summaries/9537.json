President Obama will be hosting the White House Summit on Global Development on July 20. The summit aims to bring together development leaders, financing partners, civil society, diplomats, and entrepreneurs to discuss global progress and further development efforts. The Obama Administration has focused on development as an investment in future security and prosperity, implementing new approaches that leverage financing models, empower local partners, harness innovation, and measure progress based on real-world results. The administration's signature initiatives, such as Feed the Future, Power Africa, and the Open Government Partnership, have led to significant reductions in poverty, malnutrition, and infant and maternal mortality, as well as increased entrepreneurship, economic growth, access to education for young women, and the building of more stable and inclusive societies. However, billions of people still face poverty, violence, and disease, and corrupt and unaccountable governments pose threats to stability and create conditions for conflict and extremism. The summit seeks to institutionalize progress and recommit to expanding dignity and opportunity worldwide. The United States will continue to lead on these issues and collaborate with partners to shape the future of global development.
