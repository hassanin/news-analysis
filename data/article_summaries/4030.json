The Biden Administration has approved debt cancellation for an additional 74,000 student loan borrowers in the United States. This brings the total number of people who have had their debt cancelled under the Administration to over 3.7 million. Of the borrowers approved for relief, around 44,000 are teachers, nurses, firefighters, and other individuals who earned forgiveness after 10 years of public service. Additionally, close to 30,000 borrowers who have been in repayment for at least 20 years but never received relief through income-driven repayment plans will also benefit. The Administration attributes its ability to deliver relief to these borrowers to fixes made to broken student loan programs that were preventing borrowers from receiving the relief they were entitled to. The Administration has also achieved other accomplishments in the student loan space, such as increasing Pell Grants for low-income families and fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. They have also created the SAVE plan, which is touted as the most generous Income-Driven Repayment plan in history. Borrowers can apply for relief on the studentaid.gov website. Despite the recent Supreme Court decision on the Administration's student debt relief plan, they are still working on alternative paths to provide relief to as many borrowers as possible. The Administration remains committed to improving the student loan system and reducing the burden of student loan debt.
