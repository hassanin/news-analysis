On July 9, 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to improve Hispanic Americans' access to educational and economic opportunities. The order establishes the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative, which will be housed in the Department of Education. The initiative's mission is to identify and promote practices that improve educational and economic outcomes for Hispanic Americans. It will also encourage public-private partnerships, develop a national network of individuals and organizations, monitor government programs, and advise the President on issues related to Hispanic Americans' prosperity. The order also establishes the President's Advisory Commission on Hispanic Prosperity, which will promote pathways to in-demand jobs, strengthen Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), promote partnerships, and provide recommendations for improving federal programs. The commission will periodically report to the President on progress and will have a chair and two vice chairs. The order supersedes previous executive orders and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
