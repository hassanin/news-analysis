The President has signed legislation extending the duty-free treatment available to 131 developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program for a year. This legislation also extends the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) program for a year, which applies to imports from Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. The extension of these programs demonstrates America's commitment to working with developing countries to increase their participation in the global trading system. The GSP program helps increase trade, create jobs, and lower costs for US consumers and industry. The extension of the ATPA program aims to encourage trade and assist countries in the Andean region in combating narcotics production and trafficking. However, the legislation did not restore benefits to Bolivia. The US believes that improved cooperation between the two countries is necessary to combat the production and trafficking of illicit narcotics. The President has directed the administration to work with Bolivia to improve cooperation, and if successful, to work with Congress to restore benefits to Bolivia under the ATPA program.
