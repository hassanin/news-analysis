The article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama declaring April 1, 2010, as Census Day. The census is a procedure that helps identify where resources are needed in the country. It informs the government's response to the needs of American communities and ensures adequate funding for schools, hospitals, senior centers, and public works projects. The census also assists employers in selecting locations for new factories and businesses. It is important for all Americans to participate in the census to ensure accurate representation and the services they need. The 2010 Census is safe, easy to complete, and the Census Bureau protects participants' private information. The proclamation encourages Americans to complete their census form and mail it back to save taxpayer dollars and ensure everyone gets the support they deserve.
