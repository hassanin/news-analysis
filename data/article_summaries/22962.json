In a readout of the President's calls with French President Hollande and British Prime Minister Cameron, it was announced that they will work together, along with Russia and China, to seriously consider the Russian proposal to place all Syrian chemical weapons under international control. This will begin at the United Nations and may involve a discussion on a potential UN Security Council Resolution. The leaders expressed a preference for a diplomatic resolution but also emphasized the importance of developing a range of responses to the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons. The United States, France, and the United Kingdom will continue to consult closely in the coming days.
