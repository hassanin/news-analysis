The article discusses the efforts of the Biden Administration to address the student loan system and make higher education more accessible. The administration has already cancelled student debt for 3.6 million Americans and created the SAVE plan, which is an affordable student loan repayment plan. The most impactful provision of the SAVE plan, the cancellation of remaining student debt for borrowers who took out less than $12,000 in loans and have been in repayment for 10 years, will be implemented ahead of schedule. This action aims to help community college borrowers, low-income borrowers, and those struggling to repay their loans. The administration encourages eligible borrowers to sign up for the SAVE plan. Additionally, the administration has made efforts to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, increase Pell Grants, and hold colleges accountable for leaving students with unaffordable debts. Despite challenges, such as the Supreme Court's decision on the student debt relief plan, the administration is determined to provide relief to as many borrowers as possible.
