President Biden is set to sign an executive order that showcases how the United States government will use its scale and procurement power to address the climate crisis. The order aims to reduce emissions in federal operations, invest in American clean energy industries, and create clean and resilient communities. The directive sets five ambitious goals for the federal government, including transitioning to zero-emission vehicles and energy-efficient buildings, achieving net-zero emissions from federal procurement by 2050, and mainstreaming sustainability within the federal workforce. The executive order aligns with President Biden's commitment to bolstering American manufacturing industries and creating well-paying jobs while advancing environmental justice and equity. It also emphasizes the importance of partnerships to accelerate progress. The federal government's efforts to meet these goals include transitioning to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2030 and 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035. The order also seeks to achieve net-zero emissions buildings by 2045 and net-zero emissions from overall federal operations by 2050. The plan includes measures to develop a climate- and sustainability-focused workforce and advance environmental justice. The executive order is part of the broader initiative to invest in clean energy and technology and make the United States more economically competitive.
