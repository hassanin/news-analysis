In just his second full week in office, the President spoke to Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer about Congress beginning action on the American Rescue Plan. He also received a letter from 10 Republican Senators requesting a meeting to discuss their ideas on addressing the current crises. In response, the President spoke to Senator Collins and invited her and the other signers of the letter to the White House for a full exchange of views. The need for action is urgent due to the threat posed by the virus and the grim economic conditions. The American Rescue Plan, which includes $1400 relief checks, investment in fighting COVID and reopening schools, aid to small businesses and hurting families, and funds for first responders, is seen as necessary. Leading economists have emphasized the danger of doing too little rather than doing too much. Americans from both parties are looking to their leaders to address the current situation.
