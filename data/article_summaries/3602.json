This week, the White House held a roundtable discussion with Black mayors and county officials to explore ways to grow and train the local workforce for high-quality jobs under President Biden's Investing in America agenda. The mayors of Baltimore and Augusta, along with mayors from Atlanta, Birmingham, Little Rock, Long Beach, Mount Vernon, and Newport News, participated in the discussion. County officials from Shelby County, Fulton County, Almeda County, and Tarrant County were also present. The participants received information on technical resources available to access programs from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act. They discussed best practices for local governments to partner with philanthropy, unions, and NGOs to train and connect American workers to jobs. The discussion also focused on ensuring equitable access to good jobs for all through resources like the Investing in American Technical Assistance Guide and initiatives like the White House Workforce Hubs. Senior Biden-Harris Administration officials were in attendance as well.
