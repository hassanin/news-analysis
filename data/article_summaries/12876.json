This article is a presidential proclamation issued by Barack Obama on September 30, 2015. The proclamation modifies the duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and makes changes to the eligibility of certain articles and countries for preferential tariff treatment. It states that certain articles can be designated as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the GSP when imported from a least-developed beneficiary developing country. It also revokes waivers that have been in effect for five years or more for certain beneficiary developing countries that exported eligible articles in quantities exceeding the applicable limitations. Additionally, the proclamation disregards the competitive need limitations for certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries if the aggregate appraised value of imports does not exceed a certain amount. The proclamation terminates the designation of Seychelles, Uruguay, and Venezuela as beneficiary developing countries, as they have become "high income" countries. It also terminates Seychelles' designation as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for the purpose of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The proclamation modifies the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to reflect these changes. The modifications to the HTS set forth in the proclamation are effective on specified dates. The proclamation supersedes any previous proclamations or executive orders that are inconsistent with its actions.
