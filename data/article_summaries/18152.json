President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Stephen Harper have directed the creation of a United States-Canada Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) to promote economic growth, job creation, and benefits for consumers and businesses through increased regulatory transparency and coordination. The RCC, composed of senior regulatory, trade, and foreign affairs officials from both governments, has a two-year mandate. The first meeting of the RCC will be convened within 90 days. The aim of this initiative is to enhance economic competitiveness and well-being while maintaining high standards of public health, safety, and environmental protection. Regulatory cooperation is seen as crucial for the recovery of both countries' economies and for improving productivity and competitiveness. The United States and Canada intend to eliminate unnecessary burdens on cross-border trade, reduce costs, foster cross-border investment, and promote certainty for businesses and the public by coordinating, simplifying, and ensuring the compatibility of regulations. The RCC will focus on sectors characterized by high levels of integration, significant growth potential, and rapidly evolving technologies. Both countries are committed to evidence-based, predictable, and cost-effective regulatory approaches to enable businesses to innovate and grow while protecting the safety and welfare of their citizens.
