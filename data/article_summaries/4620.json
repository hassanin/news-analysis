President Joe Biden delivered a brief statement regarding the military coup in Burma (also known as Myanmar). He expressed deep bipartisan concern over the assault on Burma's transition to democracy and mentioned consulting with Senator McConnell and allies in the Indo-Pacific region. The United States has been driving vigorous diplomatic outreach to coordinate an international response to the coup. Last week, the U.N. Security Council issued a strong statement in support of Burmese democracy, and this week, the U.S. plans to use its renewed engagement on the Human Rights Council to strengthen the world's commitment to human rights in Burma. President Biden called on the Burmese military to immediately release democratic political leaders and activists, including Aung San Suu Kyi and Win Myint. He announced a series of actions, including preventing the generals from accessing $1 billion in Burmese government funds held in the United States, imposing sanctions on military leaders and their business interests, implementing strong export controls, and freezing U.S. assets benefiting the Burmese government. The U.S. will continue supporting healthcare, civil society groups, and other areas benefiting the people of Burma directly. President Biden emphasized that violence against those asserting their democratic rights is unacceptable, and the U.S. will continue to call it out. He stated that additional measures may be imposed and urged other nations to join in these efforts.
