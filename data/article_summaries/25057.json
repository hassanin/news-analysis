President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring August 20 through August 26, 2017, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. In the proclamation, he expresses gratitude to the employers and communities who support the men and women serving in the National Guard and Reserve. The support of employers is important in sustaining an all-volunteer force, as they play a vital role in easing the transition from civilian life to military service and back again. President Trump encourages all Americans to join in honoring the sacrifices made by the National Guard and Reserve and to facilitate their service to the nation.
