The President of the United States, Barack Obama, had a phone call with President Fran√ßois Hollande of France to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine. Both leaders expressed their preference for a bilateral ceasefire, with the full support of Russia, and a peaceful resolution to the conflict, which includes the release of all hostages. However, due to the separatists' lack of effort to engage in talks or adhere to the ceasefire, President Obama acknowledged the Ukrainian government's responsibility to maintain public order and protect its population. They also agreed that Russia has a responsibility to stop its destabilizing activities, such as allowing the transit of weapons and fighters across the border, military build-up near the border, and support for violent separatists. The Presidents decided that the United States and Europe should take coordinated measures to impose costs on Russia if it does not take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.
