President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 will continue beyond July 24, 2012. The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations pose a threat to international political and economic systems. These organizations are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous, infiltrating foreign governments and the international financial system. They weaken democratic institutions, undermine economic markets, and facilitate violent conflicts. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency to address these threats to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States.
