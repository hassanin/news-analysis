In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reports on the recent attacks by militia groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) against US personnel and facilities in Iraq and Syria. He states that these attacks have caused injuries to US personnel and endangered the lives of both US personnel and Coalition forces. In response to these attacks and the threat of future attacks, President Biden directed targeted strikes against facilities in Iraq used by IRGC and IRGC-affiliated groups. The strikes were conducted to deter future attacks, minimize civilian casualties, and protect US personnel operating under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. The goal was to degrade and disrupt the ongoing series of attacks and deter Iran and Iran-backed militia groups from further attacking US personnel and facilities. President Biden asserts that the military action was taken in accordance with his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive, and in line with international law and the United States' inherent right of self-defense. He also mentions that he is providing this report to keep Congress informed, as required by the War Powers Resolution.
