The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has proposed a rule to implement the Fair Housing Act's requirement to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing. This rule aims to combat and end racial discrimination in the housing system and overcome patterns of segregation. The rule builds upon the work done during the Obama-Biden Administration and emphasizes that communities must take action, rather than simply stating they won't discriminate. This is seen as an important step in expanding equity in housing and fulfilling the promise of a nation of opportunity and equity for all.
