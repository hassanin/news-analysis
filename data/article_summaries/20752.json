President Obama will sign the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which will triple the size of AmeriCorps and focus on clean energy, education, healthcare, veterans care, and economic opportunity. The bill will also provide new service opportunities for Americans at all stages of their lives. The signing event will be attended by various guests, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Mrs. Obama, Vice President Biden, Former President Bill Clinton, and General Colin Powell. The audience will consist of bipartisan members of Congress, volunteers, students, and representatives from the Corporation for National & Community Service. The SEED School, a Learn and Serve America program, is highlighted as an example of the impact of service-learning in the community.
