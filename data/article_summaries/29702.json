The United States is expressing serious concern over ongoing attacks on protestors, civic activists, and the media in Iraq, as well as restrictions on Internet access. The US believes that the Iranian regime is draining Iraq's resources and using armed groups and political allies to suppress peaceful expression. Despite facing violence and Internet shutdowns, the Iraqi people have voiced their demands for elections and electoral reforms. The US is urging the Iraqi government to stop the violence against protestors and fulfill its promise of electoral reform and early elections. The US is also calling on the international community to support a better future for the Iraqi people.
