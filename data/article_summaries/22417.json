This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism will continue. This emergency was initially declared on September 23, 2001, in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and the ongoing threat of further attacks against the United States. The actions of these individuals still pose a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13224 will remain in effect for another year.
