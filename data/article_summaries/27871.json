Second Lady Karen Pence visited MercyFirst, a non-profit human services agency in Syosset, New York. She viewed an art exhibition titled "Hope Holds No Borders: Children's Art of Compassion and Inclusion," which featured artwork created by children who participated in the art therapy program at MercyFirst. Mrs. Pence also joined an art therapy session with youth and reviewed a case summary to see the positive impact of art therapy on one of the participants. The visit concluded with Mrs. Pence touring the facility, including a meditation labyrinth garden. She commended the art therapists at MercyFirst for their important role in the healing of the children. Art therapy is an initiative championed by Mrs. Pence, and it is an integrative mental health and human services profession that uses art-making and creative processes to enrich the lives of individuals, families, and communities. MercyFirst is a non-profit social service agency that provides various programs to children and families involved in child welfare, mental health, and the juvenile justice system.
