The United States and Canada are working together to address the opioid crisis that is impacting both nations. President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met in June 2019 and agreed to develop a joint action plan. The two countries will collaborate on combating opioid trafficking, including fentanyl, and addressing the health consequences of opioid use through public health, law enforcement, and border security cooperation. They will also share information and best practices. The steering committee of the Joint Action Plan on Opioids met on January 31, 2020, to establish working groups and enhance bilateral exchanges to find solutions to key challenges in law enforcement, border security, and health.
