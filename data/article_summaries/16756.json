The White House will be opening its grounds and gardens for visitors during the 2015 Spring Garden Tours. The event will take place on April 25th and 26th, and visitors will have the opportunity to see various gardens including the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, the Rose Garden, the White House Kitchen Garden, and the South Lawn. Admission is free, but tickets are required for all attendees. The National Park Service will distribute these tickets on a first-come, first-served basis at the Ellipse Visitor Pavilion. Certain items are not allowed on the White House grounds, such as aerosols, animals (except guide dogs), oversized backpacks, balloons, food or beverages, and more. However, strollers, wheelchairs, umbrellas, and cameras are permitted. Guests with medical needs can bring necessary items, but they must inform the U.S. Secret Service upon arrival. In case of inclement weather, the event may be canceled, and guests are encouraged to check the status by calling the 24-hour information line. Visitors can share their experience on social media using the hashtag #WHGarden.
