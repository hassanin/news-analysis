In a recent speech, President Biden discussed the progress made in the fight against COVID-19 and the importance of booster shots. He highlighted the six-part plan for the fall, which includes vaccinating the unvaccinated, protecting the vaccinated, keeping children safe in schools, increasing testing and masking, protecting the economy, and improving care for COVID-19 patients. The FDA and CDC have completed their review and determined that the majority of Americans who were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine are now eligible for a booster shot six months after their second shot. This includes individuals who are 65 years old or older, adults with certain underlying health conditions, and those at increased risk due to their work or living situation. The President encouraged eligible individuals to get their booster shots and emphasized that they are free and easily accessible at thousands of locations nationwide. He also addressed the issue of vaccine hesitancy and the impact it has on the pandemic, urging unvaccinated individuals to get vaccinated and highlighting the consequences of not doing so. The President also answered questions on topics such as the border situation and the progress of his economic plan.
