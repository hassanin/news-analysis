The Biden-Harris administration is set to release its National Cybersecurity Strategy, which aims to address the growing cyber threats faced by the United States. The strategy builds on previous efforts and focuses on several key pillars. First, it aims to rebalance the responsibility for managing cyber risk onto those who are best positioned to handle it, such as industry and the federal government. Second, it seeks to defend critical infrastructure by expanding cybersecurity requirements and enabling public-private collaboration. Third, it aims to disrupt and dismantle threat actors by using all instruments of national power to make it harder for them to threaten national security. Fourth, it seeks to shape market forces to drive security and resilience by placing responsibilities on those who can address the risks and shifting the consequences of poor cybersecurity away from the most vulnerable. Lastly, it emphasizes the importance of international partnerships to pursue shared goals and promote responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The strategy also mentions the need to address software liability and the use of offensive operations to combat cyber threats. The implementation plan is being developed in parallel with the strategy and is expected to be released in the coming months.
