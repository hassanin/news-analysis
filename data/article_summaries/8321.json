Vice President Harris met with four voting rights advocates in Atlanta, Georgia. The advocates are focused on supporting poll workers, strengthening election infrastructure, and increasing accessibility for voters with disabilities and those requiring in-language materials. The group discussed the impact of voting restrictions on marginalized communities and raised concerns about Georgia's state legislation. They also expressed support for federal legislation. The participants shared their efforts in educating voters and helping Georgians register to vote. Senator Raphael Warnock, Senator Jon Ossoff, and Representative Nikema Williams also participated in the conversation. This is the Vice President's third event on voting rights this week, following meetings with Texas lawmakers and advocates in South Carolina. The Vice President is implementing a comprehensive strategy to protect and expand voting rights with the involvement of all Americans.
