In a statement issued during Down Syndrome Awareness Month, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump celebrate the lives and achievements of Americans with Down syndrome. They express gratitude for the contributions these individuals make to their families, communities, and the nation, and pledge to empower them to reach their full potential.

The statement emphasizes the inherent value of every human life and the need to create a society that appreciates and respects the dignity of life at all stages. The president encourages the creation of an inclusive nation where people with Down syndrome are embraced in schools, workplaces, and communities, and where discrimination is no longer tolerated. The statement concludes by acknowledging the enrichment that Americans with Down syndrome bring to the country and expressing inspiration by their joyful spirit.
