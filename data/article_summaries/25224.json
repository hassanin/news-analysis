President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring May 2019 as National Foster Care Month in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of investing in the future of children, instilling family values, and ensuring they have every opportunity to reach their full potential. It recognizes the efforts of kindhearted citizens who open their homes to children in need and honors the contributions of individuals, organizations, and professionals who support foster and kinship caregivers. The proclamation also highlights the importance of keeping families united whenever possible and mentions the Family First Prevention Services Act, which aims to provide evidence-based prevention and early intervention services to bolster families and keep children safely in their homes. It emphasizes the preference for placing children with relatives in kinship care when it becomes necessary to move them out of their homes. The proclamation encourages Americans to observe National Foster Care Month by helping children and youth in foster care and recognizing the commitment of foster parents and caregivers.
