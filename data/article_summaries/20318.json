The White House has announced the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to help uninsured Americans gain coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Despite the success of the coverage provisions, there are still 10.5 million eligible people without insurance. The challenge calls on community leadership in 20 selected communities to build outreach efforts to reach the uninsured and help them gain coverage. At the end of the enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of new signups in each community to the estimated number of eligible uninsured people at the start of enrollment. The community that makes the most progress will receive recognition, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama. The 20 participating communities include Atlanta, Milwaukee, Charlotte, Nashville, Chicago, New Orleans, Dallas, Oakland, Denver, Philadelphia, Detroit, Phoenix, Great Falls, Richmond, Kansas City, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Seattle, Long Beach, and Tampa.
