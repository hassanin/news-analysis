In a statement, President Trump announced that the United States officially recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and plans to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He cited the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which was passed by Congress in 1995, urging the relocation of the embassy. Previous presidents have exercised a waiver in the law, postponing the move in an effort to advance peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine. Trump argued that after more than two decades of waivers, there has been no progress towards a lasting peace agreement. He emphasized that recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital is a recognition of reality and the right thing to do. However, he also stated that the decision does not reflect a departure from the commitment to facilitating a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. The United States remains committed to a two-state solution if agreed upon by both parties. Trump called for calm and moderation in response to the announcement and urged all parties to maintain the status quo at Jerusalem's holy sites. Vice President Pence will be traveling to the region to reaffirm the commitment to work with partners in the Middle East to defeat radicalism.
