President Joseph R. Biden has issued a proclamation declaring October 16 through October 22, 2022, as National Forest Products Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of forests in providing resources such as lumber, paper, medicines, water, and clean air. It also acknowledges the threat forests face from wildfires, climate change, and illegal deforestation. The Biden administration is committed to conserving, restoring, and revitalizing forests both domestically and internationally. This includes investments in forest health, fire prevention, combating wildfires, and planting over a billion new trees. The administration is also working with global partners to fight deforestation and trafficking of illegally logged wood. The Executive Order signed by President Biden recognizes the significance of Indigenous knowledge and Tribal treaty rights in forest management. Additionally, sustainable wood manufacturing innovations are creating union jobs, and Forest Service Wood Innovations and Community Wood grants are being awarded across the country. These efforts align with the goal of conserving at least 30 percent of America's lands and waters by 2030. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to recognize the stewardship of the nation's forests and highlights the importance of preserving forests for future generations.
