On World Malaria Day, the United States reaffirms its commitment to ending malaria worldwide. Although malaria was eliminated in the US in 1951, it continues to threaten over half of the global population and claims the life of a child every minute. Climate change also poses a risk as rising temperatures create new vulnerable areas. Through the President's Malaria Initiative, the US has saved over 11.7 million lives and prevented 2 billion malaria infections worldwide. In FY 2022, the initiative provided $33 million to support community health workers, training, supervision, and equipment. The US is also working with partners to support local manufacturing of mosquito nets and malaria medicines. The President's Malaria Initiative is expanding to include three new partners: Burundi, The Gambia, and Togo. The FY 2024 Budget includes increased support for Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, which is accelerating efforts to roll out a new malaria vaccine. Additionally, the recent replenishment conference for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, hosted by the US, raised the largest amount ever, saving millions of lives. The US remains committed to ending malaria and building a healthier and more prosperous world for future generations.
