On August 13, 2009, President Barack Obama sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate regarding the Export Administration Act. The letter states that Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act requires the President to publish in the Federal Register and transmit to Congress a notice if a national emergency is to continue beyond its anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, President Obama has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the emergency caused by the lapse of the Export Administration Act of 1979 will continue in effect for 1 year beyond August 17, 2009.
