First Lady Michelle Obama announced that Subway Restaurants has made a three-year commitment to promote healthier choices to children as part of her Let's Move! initiative. Subway will strengthen its nutritious menu offerings for kids, launch new campaigns to increase fruit and vegetable consumption, and set new marketing standards for products aimed at families. This commitment follows the First Lady's call for the private sector to use marketing to promote healthier products and decrease the marketing of unhealthy products to children. Subway will only offer items on its kids' menu that meet strong nutritional guidelines, deliver $41 million in media value over the next three years to market healthier options, and focus all kid-focused marketing on the healthier choices available in its restaurants.
