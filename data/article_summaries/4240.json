The Vice President, Kamala Harris, held a teleconference to discuss the work being done by federal workers and the administration's commitment to supporting labor unions and workers. She expressed gratitude for the important work federal workers do on behalf of the public and highlighted the administration's goal of being the most pro-union administration in American history.

Harris praised Secretary Marty Walsh for his support of organized labor and thanked the Office of Personnel Management Director Kiran Ahuja for their work. The administration has been working to help federal workers organize and collectively bargain, believing that a stronger workforce leads to higher productivity and lower turnover.

Two new policies were announced during the teleconference. First, new hires will be informed of their eligibility to join a union, provided with contact information, and informed of their rights. Second, current workers will be reminded of their eligibility to join a union. These policies aim to remove barriers to organizing in the federal workplace and ensure workers are aware of their rights.

The administration's broader strategy is to make the federal government a model employer and encourage all industries to prioritize the dignity of work, productivity, and morale. As the largest employer in the United States, the federal government's efforts will impact a significant number of people and set an example for other industries.

The teleconference concluded with an introduction of Labor Secretary Marty Walsh.
