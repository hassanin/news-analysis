President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in Nicaragua, which was declared in Executive Order 13851 on November 27, 2018, is to continue beyond November 27, 2021. The President cites the violent response by the Nicaraguan government to protests that began in April 2018, as well as the regime's dismantling of democratic institutions, undermining of the rule of law, use of indiscriminate violence, repressive tactics against civilians, and corruption leading to economic destabilization as reasons for the continued national emergency. President Biden believes that the situation in Nicaragua poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The notice was sent to the Federal Register for publication.
