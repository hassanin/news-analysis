The Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization, established by President Biden's executive order, held its first meeting. The group, co-chaired by National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, aims to identify and deliver federal resources to revitalize the local economies of coal, oil and gas, and power plant communities. They discussed strategies to deploy grants, federal loan programs, technical assistance, financing, procurement, and other initiatives to support these communities. The Working Group also plans to engage with various stakeholders, including state, local, and Tribal officials, labor unions, business leaders, environmental justice organizations, and community groups. The meeting emphasized President Biden's commitment to investing in coal, oil and gas, and power plant communities as part of an equitable clean energy revolution that will create millions of good-paying, union jobs. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm introduced the Department of Energy staff supporting the Working Group's efforts.
