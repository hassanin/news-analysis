In this proclamation, President Barack Obama declares February as American Heart Month in order to raise awareness about heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for one's own health and the health of children by adopting heart-healthy habits such as exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy diet, and avoiding tobacco. The President also highlights the significance of good nutrition and physical activity in combating obesity, a major risk factor for heart disease. The proclamation recognizes the efforts of healthcare professionals, researchers, and heart health ambassadors in the fight against heart disease. The President mentions investments in cutting-edge research, such as a DNA sequencing study, to improve treatment options for high-risk individuals. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Heart Truth campaign is also acknowledged for raising awareness among women about their risk of heart disease. The proclamation concludes by urging Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 5, 2010, as a symbol of support for women's heart disease awareness.
