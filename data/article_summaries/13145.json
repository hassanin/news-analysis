First Lady Michelle Obama, Dr. Jill Biden, and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will be discussing new preventive health benefits under the Affordable Care Act. The event will take place at The George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates and will be webcast live. The discussion will focus on the importance of preventive care in reducing chronic and preventable diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Under the Affordable Care Act, new insurance plans are required to provide preventive care without cost-sharing, making it more accessible for Americans. Secretary Sebelius will also hold a conference call with the media following the event.
