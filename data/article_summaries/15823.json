President Barack Obama sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives requesting consideration for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 budget amendments. These amendments are for the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of State and Other International Programs (State/OIP) to fund Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The amendments would provide $58.6 billion for DOD OCO activities, which is $20.9 billion less than the placeholder amount in the FY 2015 Budget. Additionally, $1.4 billion would be provided for State/OIP OCO activities, in addition to the $5.9 billion already included in the FY 2015 Budget. The amendments would decrease the total OCO funding requested for FY 2015 by $19.5 billion. The Budget initially included a placeholder amount for DOD OCO funding, as final decisions regarding U.S. forces in Afghanistan had not yet been made. These amendments include updates to the OCO request to fund military operations in Afghanistan, the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund, the European Reassurance Initiative, and State/OIP peacekeeping costs in the Central African Republic.
