The President has notified Congress that he plans to remove Russia's eligibility for trade benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. This decision is based on the fact that Russia is now considered economically advanced and no longer requires preferential treatment given to less developed countries. Once this change is implemented through a presidential proclamation, imports of GSP-eligible goods from Russia will be subject to regular rates of duty.
