The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index has reached a 13-year high of 56.7 in February, thanks to tax-cut-induced pay raises, bonuses, and stock-market gains. The index reflects positive sentiment among respondents, with the polling conducted during President Trump's State of the Union Address, where he delivered an optimistic economic message. Many companies, including Walmart and JPMorgan Chase, have announced pay raises and bonuses, crediting the tax legislation for these actions. The Economic Optimism Index is now in solidly optimistic territory, reaching its highest point since October 2004.
