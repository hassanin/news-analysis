On July 2, 2010, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 5569, extends the National Flood Insurance Program through September 30, 2010, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to enter into new contracts for flood insurance. It also reduces FEMA's borrowing authority by $50 million. 

The second bill, H.R. 5611, extends the collection of taxes that fund the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, as well as the ability to make expenditures and grants to airports under the Airport Improvement Program. This extension is effective until August 1, 2010. 

The third bill, H.R. 5623, extends the deadline for homebuyers to close on a home and be eligible for the homebuyer tax credit.
