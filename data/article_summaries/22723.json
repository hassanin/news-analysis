The President of the United States released a statement encouraging Americans to support relief efforts in the Philippines following the devastating impact of Typhoon Haiyan. He expressed condolences for the loss of lives and offered support to Filipino-Americans who are concerned about their loved ones. The President emphasized the strong friendship between the two countries and pledged continued assistance. He urged Americans to visit whitehouse.gov/typhoon to find ways to help, as even small contributions can make a significant difference in providing food, water, shelter, and medicine to those in need. The US government is already providing aid through organizations such as USAID and the military, with planes and ships delivering emergency supplies and support. The President acknowledged that recovering from the storm will take years but expressed confidence in the resilience of the Filipino people. He assured the Filipino allies that the US stands with them and will support their recovery efforts.
