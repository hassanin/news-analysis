Director Mulvaney held a press briefing to announce the fiscal year 2018 presidential budget. He emphasized that this budget is written through the eyes of the taxpayers, focusing on their perspective rather than just the recipients of benefits. The budget aims to balance in 10 years and reduce the deficit as a percentage of the overall economy in year one. The goal is to achieve sustained 3 percent economic growth in the country again, which the previous administration and Congressional Budget Office did not believe was possible. The budget prioritizes spending on defense, border security, veterans, school choice, and infrastructure. It also proposes reforms to entitlement programs, such as requiring a Social Security number to receive certain tax credits and introducing a state match for Medicaid programs. The budget does not touch mainline Social Security, Medicare, or funding for Israel and Egypt. Planned Parenthood and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be defunded. The budget assumes passage of the American Health Care Act and the President's tax plan, which is currently in its early stages. The budget also includes a cap on discretionary spending, reducing it by two cents on the dollar each year.
