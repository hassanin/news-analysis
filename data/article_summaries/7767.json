President Joe Biden proclaims March 21, 2023, as National Agriculture Day in the United States. He celebrates the farmers, farmworkers, ranchers, fishers, foresters, and other agricultural workers who contribute to the nation's strength, economy, and land stewardship. The agricultural community shares a spirit of tradition, innovation, and perseverance. Small farmers and processors face challenges such as extreme weather, market domination by large companies, corporate consolidation, and lack of competition. President Biden's administration aims to promote fair competition in agriculture and address these challenges. Efforts include encouraging antitrust agencies to focus on anti-competitive practices, securing the right to repair for farmers, assisting smaller meat processors, investing in domestic fertilizer production, expanding crop insurance, and improving infrastructure and broadband access. The administration is also investing in climate-smart agriculture and addressing systemic discrimination to support farmers of color. President Biden emphasizes the importance of fair pay, safe conditions, and the right to join a union for farm and food workers, including undocumented workers who contribute to the economy. He calls for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented farmworkers. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to recognize and appreciate the contributions of agricultural workers across the nation.
