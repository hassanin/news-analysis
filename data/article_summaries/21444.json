In this message from President Barack Obama to Congress, he discusses the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008 (HOPE II). This act amended the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) to allow certain products from Haiti to receive preferential tariff treatment. The president states that imports from Haiti will continue to be eligible for this treatment if certain eligibility criteria are met. He mentions that Haiti has taken steps to meet these criteria, including establishing an independent labor ombudsman's office, selecting a labor ombudsman, and implementing a Technical Assistance Improvement and Compliance Needs Assessment and Remediation (TAICNAR) Program in cooperation with the International Labor Organization. Haiti has also implemented an electronic visa system to track eligible producers and made participation in the TAICNAR Program a requirement for using this system. Based on these actions, President Obama certifies that Haiti has met the requirements set forth in the CBERA. The message is dated October 16, 2009.
