The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released a statement on the 2018 Monitoring the Future (MTF) study, which found a decrease in prescription opioid use among teenagers. The Deputy Director of ONDCP, James Carroll, stated that reaching young Americans at an early age to educate them about the dangers of prescription drug abuse is crucial. While the results are encouraging, there is still work to be done to address the abuse of prescription opioids and illegal drugs in communities. The study found that the use of prescription narcotics among 12th graders decreased from 4.2% in 2017 to 3.4% in 2018, and past year use of specific prescription narcotics also decreased among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders. The MTF study is an ongoing survey conducted by the University of Michigan to monitor the behaviors, attitudes, and values of American secondary school students, college students, and young adults.
