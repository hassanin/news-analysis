President Trump and senior members of the Administration met with leaders in the video game industry and violence experts to discuss the impact of violent video game exposure on children. The Administration has been focused on preventing violent behavior in schools and mass shootings. During the meeting, the group discussed the effect of violent video games on young males and acknowledged that some studies have shown a correlation between video game violence and real violence. The conversation centered around whether violent video games desensitize the community to violence. This meeting is part of ongoing discussions with local leaders and Congress on school and public safety.
