President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Iowa due to severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between April 17-30, 2013. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Appanoose, Cedar, Clinton, Davis, Decatur, Des Moines, Iowa, Johnson, Keokuk, Lee, Lucas, Marion, Monroe, Muscatine, Ringgold, Van Buren, Wapello, Warren, and Wayne. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Joe M. Girot has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made later if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
