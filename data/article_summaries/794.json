The Vice President and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury held a teleconference to announce the distribution of $1.7 billion in funds to 603 community lenders through the CDFI Equitable Recovery Program. These grants are aimed at providing access to capital and financial services to underserved communities, including minority-owned businesses, low-income communities, and rural areas. The funds will help support small businesses, create affordable housing, and promote economic growth in these communities. The grants do not need to be repaid, and the recipients can use the funds to expand their services and support local organizations. The program is part of the administration's efforts to address the disparities in access to capital and promote an equitable economy. The grants will be distributed over the coming months, and the recipients can start utilizing the funds once they receive confirmation from the Treasury Department. The administration sees these investments as essential for closing the racial wealth gap and ensuring that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed and thrive.
