At the direction of President Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to North Korea to prepare for the upcoming meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un. During Pompeo's visit, North Korea released three American detainees, which Trump views as a positive gesture of goodwill. The detainees appear to be in good condition and were able to walk onto the plane without assistance.
