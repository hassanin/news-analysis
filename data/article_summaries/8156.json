Speaker McCarthy has released a blueprint that aims to cut various programs that benefit American families. This move has been criticized as siding with the extreme MAGA wing of his party and potentially harming hard-working Americans. The blueprint includes cuts to education, veterans medical care, cancer research, meals on wheels, food safety, and law enforcement. It is also seen as a threat to American manufacturing and job opportunities, as well as healthcare and food assistance for millions of Americans. Additionally, it is argued that the blueprint would increase energy bills and taxes for working families while protecting the wealthy and big corporations. This approach stands in contrast to President Biden's budget, which focuses on investing in America, lowering costs for families, and asking the super-wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share. House Republicans are urged to avoid default and prioritize the livelihoods and retirements of the American people, as they have expressed their support for a different economic vision.
