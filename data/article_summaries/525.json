Vice President Kamala Harris has announced several federal actions aimed at improving transportation and reducing air pollution. The actions include expanding clean public transit and school buses, reducing emissions from diesel trucks, and creating jobs. The Biden-Harris Administration plans to modernize public transit, freight trucks, and school buses by leveraging investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and American Rescue Plan. These actions aim to deliver better transportation while reducing air pollution that disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of color. Heavy-duty vehicles, such as buses and trucks, contribute significantly to transportation greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. The actions announced will electrify buses, with over $5.5 billion being invested in the Low- and No-Emission Transit Vehicle Program, the largest investment in the program to date. The program helps state and local governments purchase or lease zero-emission and low-emission transit buses. The Biden-Harris Administration is also awarding $17 million in rebates to fund electric and low-emission school buses. Additionally, the EPA has proposed a rule to reduce emissions from new trucks by up to 90% by 2031 compared to current standards. The administration is also focusing on cleaning port operations and catalyzing zero-emission truck infrastructure. The Department of Energy and Department of Transportation are investing in updating trucking fleets and freight infrastructure to be cleaner and more efficient. The federal government is leading by example by transforming its fleet of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles to zero-emission vehicles. These actions aim to create good-paying jobs, improve public health, and address climate change.
