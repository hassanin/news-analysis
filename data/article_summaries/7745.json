The article discusses the positive impact of President Biden's economic policies, referred to as "Bidenomics." It highlights that inflation has been decreasing over the past twelve months and now stands at 3%. Despite this, the economy remains strong, with record-low unemployment and a higher percentage of working-age Americans employed than in the past twenty years. Real wages for the average worker have also increased, particularly for lower-wage workers. The article emphasizes that these achievements are not coincidental but a result of deliberate efforts to lower costs for families and prioritize economic growth from the middle and bottom rather than the top.
