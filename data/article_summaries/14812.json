President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 27 through June 2, 2012, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about hurricane hazards and taking action to protect families, homes, and neighborhoods. The administration is working with communities, state and local officials, and various organizations to develop robust systems for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. The public is encouraged to create emergency supply kits, learn evacuation routes, and develop family communication plans. The proclamation also calls upon government agencies, private organizations, schools, media, and residents in coastal areas to share information about hurricane preparedness and response.
