The White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, held a press gaggle aboard Air Force One on April 17, 2009. He provided scheduling information for President Obama's meetings in Trinidad and Tobago, including a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Manning and a multilateral meeting with CARICOM nations. Gibbs also discussed Raul Castro's recent comments and the President's stance on engagement with Cuba. He confirmed that the President still has full confidence in Steve Rattner and addressed a meeting the President is expected to have with banks regarding credit cards. Gibbs mentioned that the President's remarks on Cuba were written prior to Castro's comments, but he would check if there were any changes. He also mentioned the possibility of the President meeting with Captain Phillips upon his return to the United States.
