In this statement, President Obama expresses his support for the Syrian people's pursuit of a peaceful transition to democracy. He condemns the Syrian government's brutal response to peaceful protests and its violations of the universal rights of the Syrian people. The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on President Assad and his government, and efforts have been made at the UN Security Council to condemn Syria's actions. President Obama emphasizes that the future of Syria should be determined by its people, but Bashar al-Assad is standing in their way. He calls for President Assad to step aside and allow a democratic transition to take place. The United States will support efforts to bring about a democratic and inclusive Syria by pressuring President Assad and standing up for the universal rights of the Syrian people. President Obama announces unprecedented sanctions to financially isolate the Assad regime and disrupt its ability to finance violence against the Syrian people. He also highlights the need for patience as the Syrian people continue their struggle for justice. Despite President Assad's repressive tactics, President Obama believes that the Syrian people will determine their own destiny.
