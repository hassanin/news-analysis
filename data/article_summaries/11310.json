In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims June 2012 as National Oceans Month. He highlights the importance of healthy oceans, coasts, and waterways in feeding the nation, supporting the economy, and providing recreation opportunities. However, he also acknowledges the threats posed to the oceans by pollution, coastal development, overfishing, and climate change. To address these issues, President Obama established the National Ocean Policy, which aims to conserve and manage the oceans based on scientific principles. The policy brings together various stakeholders, including federal, state, and local governments, as well as fishermen, boaters, industries, environmental groups, scientists, and the public. The president encourages Americans to take action to protect and restore the oceans, coasts, and the Great Lakes.
