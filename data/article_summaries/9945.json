President Barack Obama issued a proclamation declaring June 11, 2010, as King Kamehameha Day. The proclamation recognizes the historical significance of King Kamehameha the Great, who unified the Hawaiian Islands and is known as the "Napoleon of the Pacific." The proclamation also acknowledges the Hawaiian narrative, which includes both triumph and deep injustice, such as the oppression of Native Hawaiians and the eventual conquest of their sovereign kingdom. Despite these challenges, the proclamation highlights the resilience of Native Hawaiians and their contribution to the diverse culture and traditions of Hawaii. The proclamation encourages Americans to celebrate the rich heritage of Hawaii and recognizes the Aloha Spirit as a reflection of the American Spirit.
