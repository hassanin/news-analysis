The Fair Housing Act, which ensures the right to obtain housing free from discrimination, is commemorating its 55th anniversary. Despite its significance, there is still progress to be made. Many neighborhoods remain segregated, disparities in homeownership rates by race and ethnicity persist, and the racial wealth gap has widened. The Fair Housing Act was expanded in 1988 to protect Americans with disabilities and families with children. During the Obama-Biden Administration, a rule was implemented to further fair housing, and in 2021, it was clarified that the act protects LGBTQ+ Americans. While celebrating the act's achievements, there is a call to continue working towards providing everyone with fair and accessible housing choices.
