The White House has sent a message to the Senate regarding the Extradition Treaty between the United States and the Republic of Kosovo. The treaty aims to replace an outdated treaty from 1901 and introduces a "dual criminality" approach, allowing for extradition in cases of offenses such as money laundering and cyber-related crimes. The treaty also includes provisions that extradition cannot be refused based on nationality and incorporates procedural improvements to expedite the extradition process. President Barack Obama recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the treaty and provide its advice and consent for ratification.
