The article discusses the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit included in the health reform legislation signed by President Obama. The tax credit can cover up to 35% of the premiums a small business pays to cover its workers, and this rate will increase to 50% in 2014. The tax credit is estimated to save small businesses $40 billion by 2019. Both for-profit businesses and not-for-profit organizations are eligible for the credit. The credit is available immediately and can be claimed for up to 6 years. There are eligibility criteria such as having less than 25 full-time workers, paying average annual wages below $50,000, and covering at least 50% of the cost of health care coverage for workers. The article also mentions that the Administration is launching an educational campaign to inform small businesses about the credit and how to claim it. Additionally, it highlights five other ways health reform will help small businesses, including the creation of health insurance exchanges, ending price discrimination, increasing health care security, reducing the hidden tax on small business employees with health insurance, and reducing premiums in the small group market.
