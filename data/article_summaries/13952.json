On October 28, 2015, the White House Office of the Press Secretary released a notice stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Sudan. This national emergency was initially declared on November 3, 1997, due to the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan, which posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The conflict in Sudan's Darfur region was deemed an additional threat in 2006, leading to the expansion of the national emergency and the blocking of property of certain individuals connected to the conflict. The notice states that the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan still pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, therefore the national emergency must continue beyond November 3, 2015. The President, Barack Obama, has decided to continue the national emergency for one more year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
