The author of the article emphasizes three key points about the cases before the Supreme Court. First, the administration strongly defended Roe v. Wade, arguing that it is based on a long history of precedent and protects a woman's right to choose. Second, the author directed the Gender Policy Council and White House Counsel's Office to prepare options for responding to the ongoing attacks on abortion and reproductive rights. They are ready to take action once a ruling is issued. Third, if Roe is overturned, it will be up to elected officials and voters to protect a woman's right to choose. The author calls for electing pro-choice officials and passing legislation that codifies Roe at the federal level.
