The article is a Presidential Determination by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the Defense Production Act of 1950. The determination emphasizes the importance of a robust and sustainable domestic industrial base to meet the requirements of the clean energy economy, specifically the production of large-capacity batteries. The United States currently relies on foreign sources for materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and manganese, which are essential for clean energy transition. To promote national defense, the United States must secure a reliable and sustainable supply of these materials through environmentally responsible domestic mining, processing, recycling, and recovery. The determination also states that the Secretary of Defense shall support feasibility studies and other activities to create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore domestic production capabilities for these materials. The Secretary of Defense is also required to conduct an annual survey of the domestic industrial base and report to the President and Congress. The determination also includes limitations on waiving permitting requirements and environmental health and safety laws. The determination is intended to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to appropriations.
