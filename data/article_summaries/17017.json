The article discusses the High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program in the Pacific Northwest, specifically the corridor connecting Eugene, Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver, B.C. The program aims to enhance service on this corridor and eventually have dedicated high-speed tracks where trains can operate at up to 150 mph. The investments made will result in faster, more reliable, and more frequent service for rail passengers. The improvements include adding two additional daily round trips between Seattle and Portland, reducing travel time by at least 5%, and increasing on-time performance from 62% to 88%. Major construction projects will include building bypass tracks, upgrading existing tracks and signaling systems, and funding safety-related projects such as grade separations, positive train control, and seismic retrofits. Additionally, investments will be made in upgrading Portland's Union Station and conducting engineering and environmental work for track and signaling projects to increase service reliability and reduce congestion.
