Miguel Rodriguez, who has been serving in the Obama administration since the beginning, is departing from his role as the Director of Legislative Affairs. He has worked tirelessly to bridge the partisan divide and find solutions to move the country forward. President Obama expresses gratitude for his service and highlights Rodriguez's pride in the Senate's passage of a bipartisan immigration reform plan. Katie Beirne Fallon, a veteran of Congress and Deputy Director of Communications, has been chosen as Rodriguez's successor. The President believes Fallon's expertise and strong relationships will help advance his top priority of creating jobs and expanding growth and opportunity for all Americans.
