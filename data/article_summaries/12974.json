President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress requesting budget amendments for the Department of the Interior. These amendments aim to improve oversight of offshore oil and gas operations, address issues with mineral revenue collection, and facilitate the reorganization of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement. The overall discretionary budget authority proposed in the FY 2011 Budget would not be increased by these requests.
