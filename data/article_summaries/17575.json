This article discusses an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2010 regarding partnerships with faith-based and other neighborhood organizations. The order amends previous executive orders and establishes fundamental principles and criteria for these partnerships. It emphasizes that federal agencies should distribute financial assistance for social service programs in an effective and efficient manner, allowing all eligible organizations, including faith-based ones, to compete equally for funding. It also prohibits discrimination based on religion in the administration or distribution of federal financial assistance and requires organizations receiving such assistance to not discriminate against beneficiaries based on religion. The order further states that federal programs must be implemented in accordance with the First Amendment and other applicable laws, and organizations engaging in explicitly religious activities should do so separately from federally-funded programs. The order also establishes an Interagency Working Group on Faith-Based and Other Neighborhood Partnerships to review existing agency policies and ensure consistency with the order's principles. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is instructed to issue guidance to agencies on implementing the order. The Department of Health and Human Services is designated to provide funding and administrative support for the Working Group. The order concludes by stating that it amends previous executive orders and does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits.
