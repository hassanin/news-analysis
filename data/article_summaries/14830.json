President Obama has declared a major disaster for the Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and authorized federal aid to supplement recovery efforts from severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between May 8-29, 2015. This declaration makes federal funding available to affected members of the tribe, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Gary R. Stanley as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. FEMA has also stated that additional designations may be made if requested by the tribe and warranted by further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated area can apply for assistance online or by phone.
