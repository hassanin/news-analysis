President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Arkansas due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between May 7 and June 15, 2015. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The counties of Crawford, Garland, Howard, Jefferson, Little River, Miller, Perry, Sebastian, and Sevier are eligible for federal funding to assist affected individuals. This assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in several other counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Nancy M. Casper has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by calling the provided toll-free numbers.
