President Biden will convene a meeting tomorrow with governors from western states, private sector partners, and Cabinet officials to discuss strengthening prevention, preparedness, and response efforts for the wildfire season. The meeting will address the impact of climate change, severe drought, and extreme heat on wildfires. The President will ask participants what additional resources they need and what immediate actions can be taken to protect communities and improve emergency preparedness. The administration is taking several actions to address the growing wildfire threat, including investing in firefighting personnel, extending seasonal hiring, increasing aviation capacity, improving early detection efforts, and leveraging new technologies. The meeting will be a hybrid event, with governors attending virtually and Cabinet members in person. The administration will also announce a series of pre-disaster mitigation projects to build resilient infrastructure and communities.
