The United States and the United Kingdom have entered into a historic agreement to enhance research partnerships and promote scientific collaboration. This agreement covers areas such as basic science, early-stage R&D, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, public-private partnership models, and the role of science and technology in economic prosperity. The agreement includes principles for sharing expertise, materials, and intellectual property, as well as encouraging open data. One of the major initiatives resulting from this agreement is an $88 million investment by the UK in the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) and Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). This project aims to study subatomic particles called neutrinos and is expected to create thousands of jobs. Other projects under consideration include digital research skills development, MRI and PET standards, quantum technologies, and collaborations on autonomous transportation technologies.
