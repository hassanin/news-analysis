President Obama believes that there should be increased transparency and reforms in intelligence programs to ensure strong oversight and protections against abuse. The Administration has already declassified unprecedented information about the activities of the National Security Agency (NSA). The President has engaged in a national dialogue on privacy, meeting with various stakeholders to discuss privacy issues. The Administration will work with Congress to pursue appropriate reforms to Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act and improve the public's confidence in the oversight conducted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). The President directed the Intelligence Community to make as much information about these programs public as possible and create a website for further transparency. Additionally, a high-level group of outside experts will review intelligence and communications technologies to assess their impact on security, privacy, and foreign policy.
