In early 2020, there were calls for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to gain access to China to learn more about COVID-19. However, the failure to do so has hindered any investigation into the origins of the virus. Since becoming President, Joe Biden has tasked the Intelligence Community to prepare a report on the origins of COVID-19, including whether it came from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident. The report indicates that there are two likely scenarios, but a definitive conclusion has not been reached. Biden has asked the Intelligence Community to intensify their efforts and report back to him in 90 days. He has also requested further inquiry, including specific questions for China, and involvement from National Labs and other government agencies. The United States will continue to work with other countries to pressure China into participating in an international investigation and sharing relevant data and evidence.
