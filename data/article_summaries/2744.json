President Joe Biden has proclaimed May 7 through May 13, 2023, as Public Service Recognition Week in the United States. In his proclamation, President Biden acknowledges the dedication and sacrifices of the more than 20 million public servants who work tirelessly to ensure America works for everyone. He highlights their importance in various sectors such as education, mail delivery, air traffic control, law enforcement, and defense. The President emphasizes the need to support public servants and recognize their commitment and sacrifice, especially in the face of threats and hostility. He mentions his American Rescue Plan, which allocated $350 billion to State, Tribal, and local governments to retain public servants and make new hires. Additionally, President Biden calls on Congress to provide law enforcement officers with more mental health and wellness resources and to recruit and hire 100,000 more police officers. The President also mentions his efforts to protect and empower the career Federal workforce, including increasing the minimum wage for Federal employees to $15 per hour and taking executive action to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the Federal workforce. He has also established a White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment to strengthen the right to unionize among Federal Government workers. President Biden acknowledges the financial challenges faced by public servants and highlights efforts to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which has helped over 450,000 public servants receive nearly $31 billion in loan forgiveness. The President views these actions as investments in America's future, aiming to reward work and improve the lives of others. He calls upon all Americans to celebrate public servants and their contributions during Public Service Recognition Week and throughout the year.
