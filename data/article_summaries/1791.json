The Biden Administration has announced additional actions to get students ages 12 and above vaccinated and to ensure a safe return to school this fall. They have released a "Return to School Roadmap" that provides resources and supports for students, parents, educators, and school communities. The roadmap focuses on prioritizing the health and safety of students, building school communities and supporting students' social and emotional well-being, and accelerating academic achievement. The Department will also provide resources on each of these priorities and highlight schools and districts that are using innovative practices to address them. Federal funds from the American Rescue Plan and President Biden's Build Back Better agenda will be used to address these priorities and rebuild schools and communities stronger than before.
