President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order directing US government agencies to use a single logo for all US foreign assistance. Currently, more than 20 federal agencies deliver foreign assistance under their own individual brands and logos, which has resulted in a lack of recognition for the generosity of the American people. The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development will be responsible for developing and coordinating this branding policy. The aim is to highlight the importance of US foreign assistance in saving lives, enhancing national security, and promoting economic opportunities globally.
