President Obama is set to meet with small business owners in New Jersey to discuss the economy and urge Congress to pass support for small businesses. The President will highlight how small business legislation can help these businesses grow and hire more workers. The proposed provisions include providing capital and incentives to small banks on Main Street, supporting state initiatives for creditworthy small businesses, creating tax incentives for new investments, eliminating capital gains taxes on small business investments, and continuing successful provisions from the Recovery Act. The article also mentions the stories of several small business owners attending the event, including a co-owner of a sub shop, the owner of an Italian restaurant, the owners of a paper tube manufacturing company, and the operations manager of a family business focused on energy solutions.
