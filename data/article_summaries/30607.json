President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Kansas and has ordered Federal assistance to help with recovery efforts from severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from September 1 to September 8, 2018. The Federal funding will be available to State and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties affected by this declaration are Barber, Clay, Kingman, Kiowa, Marshall, Pratt, Rice, and Riley. In addition to recovery efforts, Federal funding will also be available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Paul Taylor has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Further designations may be made in the future if requested by the State and based on damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
