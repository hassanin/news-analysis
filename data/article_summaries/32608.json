The United States has the most advanced and developed infrastructure in the world, including a reliable and diversified electric grid. President Trump believes in energy independence and wants to protect the grid from intentional attacks and natural disasters. However, the retirement of certain power facilities is causing a depletion of the country's energy mix and impacting the grid's resilience. President Trump has directed the Secretary of Energy to take immediate steps to prevent further loss of these resources and is awaiting recommendations.
