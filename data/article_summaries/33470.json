On March 26, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring that the national emergency regarding malicious cyber-enabled activities, which was initially declared on April 1, 2015, will continue beyond April 1, 2019. This national emergency was declared in response to the increasing prevalence and severity of cyber threats originating from outside the United States. The President cites the ongoing threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy as the reason for the extension. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
