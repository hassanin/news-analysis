President Biden addressed the press before heading to the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York. He discussed the issue of money in politics and the need for transparency. Biden expressed his support for the Disclosure Act, which would require advocacy groups running ads to disclose contributions above $10,000 and ban foreign entities from making contributions for these ads. He called on Republicans to join Democrats in passing the act and emphasized the importance of sunlight as the best disinfectant to combat dark money in politics. Biden also highlighted the erosion of public trust caused by dark money and urged Congress to act swiftly on this issue. In response to questions about the overwhelmed border, Biden explained that the situation is different now, with fewer immigrants coming from Central America and Mexico, but an increase from countries like Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua. He mentioned ongoing efforts to address the flow of migrants and suggested that Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, should visit Delaware to see its beautiful shoreline.
