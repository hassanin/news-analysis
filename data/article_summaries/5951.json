President Biden announced a historic investment of over $16 billion in America's railroads, specifically the Northeast Corridor from Boston to Washington. The investment aims to improve infrastructure, create jobs, reduce delays, and promote sustainability. The Northeast Corridor is the busiest rail corridor in the United States, serving 800,000 passengers daily. The president highlighted the importance of modernizing and upgrading the rail system, which currently faces outdated infrastructure, including tunnels and bridges over 100 years old. The investment includes the replacement of the Baltimore tunnel and the addition of new electric trains that will travel at 110 miles per hour. President Biden emphasized the significance of union jobs and made a plea for continued investment in rail travel, stating that the United States should have the best rail system in the world.
