The President called a meeting in the Oval Office to discuss critical supply chain issues that affect the country. He mentioned the vulnerability exposed during the past year, particularly with the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) that had to be sourced from abroad. The President also highlighted the current shortage of chips for automobiles, which is causing production slowdowns and shorter shifts for workers. He acknowledged the efforts made by a bipartisan group, led by John Cornyn, in addressing the chip shortage. The meeting aims to find solutions to these shortages and ensure the smooth functioning of supply chains.
