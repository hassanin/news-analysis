The World Humanitarian Summit is a global event aimed at strengthening the international community's response to crises caused by conflicts and natural disasters. The United States, as the largest humanitarian assistance donor, sees the summit as an opportunity to promote a stronger and more accountable international system. The U.S. government provided over $6 billion in humanitarian assistance in 2015 to various emergencies around the world. The U.S. has also pledged additional funds to support the protection of women and girls in crisis situations. The U.S. aims to strengthen the international humanitarian system, improve coherence between humanitarian and development assistance, and reduce the impact of conflict on civilians, with a focus on women and girls. The U.S. government emphasizes the importance of effective and efficient emergency assistance, better coordination among humanitarian organizations, and leadership accountability. The U.S. also aims to bridge the gap between humanitarian and development efforts, particularly in education, and supports the World Bank's engagement in protracted crises. The U.S. government will establish a Crisis Review Mechanism to determine the appropriate response approach for crises and will continue building resilience in fragile communities.
