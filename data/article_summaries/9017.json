In a speech at the South Court Auditorium, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed the tragedy that occurred in Wisconsin the previous night, expressing condolences to the families affected and the community. She then thanked Dr. Luis Padilla and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy for their commitment to fighting against COVID-19. Harris highlighted the importance of addressing health disparities, stating that COVID-19 did not create these disparities but rather exposed and exacerbated them. She discussed the administration's efforts to prioritize and reach the hardest-hit communities, such as setting up mass vaccination sites and sending mobile vaccination units. As a result, the vaccination gap among Black and brown adults has been effectively closed. Harris emphasized the ongoing work to end the pandemic and focus on vaccinating children over the age of five. She mentioned the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, which she helped create, and its final report that outlined priorities for the administration, including investing in a diverse healthcare workforce and equitable healthcare access. Harris announced a $1.5 billion investment through the American Rescue Plan to support the National Health Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and substance use disorder treatment and recovery programs. These funds will address the shortage of healthcare providers in underserved areas. She also called on Congress to pass the Build Back Better Act, which aims to address health disparities further, reduce healthcare premiums, close the Medicaid coverage gap, and invest in maternal health to combat Black maternal mortality. Harris concluded by expressing optimism that the nation is moving in the right direction to advance health equity and urged everyone to seize the opportunity.
