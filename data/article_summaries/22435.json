The United States strongly condemns the conviction and harsh sentencing of Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga in Malawi. The criminalization of sexual orientation and gender identity is deemed unacceptable, and this case negatively affects Malawi's human rights record. The US urges Malawi and all countries to cease using sexual orientation or gender identity as grounds for arrest, detention, or execution.
