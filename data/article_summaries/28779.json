The article discusses the economic growth and job market under the Trump administration. It highlights that wages have been growing at a pace not seen in over 10 years, and job openings have consistently exceeded job seekers. Despite these gains, high child care expenses limit parents' ability to work outside the home. A new paper by the Council of Economic Advisers suggests that making child care more affordable could encourage up to 10.4 million parents to enter the labor force or increase their work hours. The paper reviews evidence on the impact of wages and child care costs on work status and hours, particularly for women. It also emphasizes the importance of reducing the cost of child care by loosening regulations that do not significantly improve safety or quality. Lower child care prices would give parents more flexibility in balancing work and childcare, potentially increasing economic growth and benefiting American society as a whole.
