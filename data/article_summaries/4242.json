In 2020, the United States experienced a record-breaking year for extreme weather, with 30 named storms in the Atlantic Basin. Out of these storms, 12 made landfall in the United States, causing significant damage to individuals and communities. This highlights the threat posed by climate change. National Hurricane Preparedness Week encourages Americans in vulnerable areas to take precautions and improve resilience to climate-related catastrophes.

The costs of these storms in terms of lives, livelihoods, and property damage are staggering. Seven of the 30 named storms in 2020 resulted in 86 deaths and $40 billion in damages. Over the past two decades, tropical storms and hurricanes have taken over 6,000 lives and caused $853 billion in damage in the United States. Hurricanes not only cause visible damage but also have long-lasting emotional effects. Low-income communities and communities of color are particularly vulnerable to these events and often lack the resources to prepare for and recover from extreme weather.

The Biden administration is prioritizing the climate crisis and the most vulnerable communities. Investments are being made in weather forecasting, climate research, and resources for communities to prepare for and respond to changing storms. While hurricanes cannot be prevented, efforts are being made to predict and prepare for them. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) collaborates with various agencies and provides actionable information to communities before, during, and after a hurricane.

In addition to government efforts, individuals should also prepare themselves by keeping up with weather forecasts and having evacuation kits ready. FEMA's ready.gov website provides more information and preparedness plan templates. Everyone has a role to play in hurricane preparedness to save lives, minimize damage, and recover faster.

President Joe Biden proclaims May 9-15, 2021, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week, urging all Americans to help build a Weather-Ready Nation and calling on government agencies to share information to protect lives and property.
