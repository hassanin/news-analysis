The White House physician, Ronny L. Jackson, issued a statement regarding President's sore throat symptoms. An ear, nose, and throat specialist conducted a fiber optic exam and discovered soft tissue swelling in the posterior throat. As a precautionary measure, a routine CT scan was performed, which came back normal. The symptoms are believed to be caused by acid reflux, and appropriate treatment will be provided.
