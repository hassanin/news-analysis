The Kingdom of Bahrain, in partnership with the United States, will host the "Peace to Prosperity" economic workshop in Manama on June 25 and June 26, 2019. The workshop aims to bring together government, civil society, and business leaders to discuss potential economic investments and initiatives that could be made possible by a peace agreement. The discussions will focus on enhancing economic governance, developing human capital, and promoting private-sector growth. The workshop is seen as an opportunity to create new opportunities for Palestinians and promote economic growth in the Middle East region.
