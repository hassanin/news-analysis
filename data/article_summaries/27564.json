President Donald J. Trump is committed to securing the border and protecting the nation. He is taking both legislative and executive actions to fulfill his promise. In the Homeland Security appropriations bill, he secured significant victories that contribute to border security. Additionally, he is using his authority under the National Emergencies Act to declare a national emergency on the border. The President believes that these measures are necessary to address the national security and humanitarian crisis at the Southern Border, and to prevent crime and drug trafficking from entering the country.
