President Donald J. Trump has issued a posthumous full pardon to Susan B. Anthony, a prominent advocate for women's suffrage. The pardon is in recognition of her wrongful conviction for illegally voting in an election in 1872. Despite being denied her rights to trial by jury and due process, Anthony was convicted by a directed verdict and fined $100. She refused to pay the unjust fine and was not imprisoned, preventing her from appealing the sentence. The pardon acknowledges Anthony's advocacy, perseverance, and leadership as an American hero and pays tribute to her historic work in improving the justice of the Constitution. The decision to pardon her removes a conviction for exercising a fundamental American right and highlights the importance of voting in the upcoming November elections.
