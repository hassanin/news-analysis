The Administration strongly supports the passage of H.R. 3697, the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act, which aims to strengthen law enforcement's ability to combat transnational criminal gangs, particularly MS-13. The bill would provide law enforcement with the necessary tools to quickly deport criminal alien gang members and prevent them from reentering the United States. It would also deny them admission to the country and make them ineligible for asylum, special immigrant juvenile status, temporary protected status, and parole, with limited exceptions for law enforcement purposes. The Administration believes that strengthening immigration laws is crucial for improving domestic security, supporting law enforcement, and ensuring public safety. If presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend signing the bill into law.
