This article is about a public service announcement campaign supporting military families, led by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden's Joining Forces program. The campaign features PSAs with Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Oprah Winfrey, and is supported by major TV networks such as A+E Networks, CBS, Comcast NBC, Disney ABC, FOX, and WB. The PSAs call on all Americans to give back and support military families by visiting the Joining Forces website. The website has been revamped to include more volunteer opportunities and resources. The campaign was created by the Inter-Guild Joining Forces Task Force, led by producer Bruce Cohen, and includes contributions from various organizations. The initiative aims to raise awareness and provide support in areas such as employment, education, and wellness for military families. The PSAs were written, directed, and produced by members of the Task Force.
