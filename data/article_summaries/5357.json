President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska to assist with disaster recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding between March 13 and April 1, 2019. Under the previous major disaster declaration, federal funding was available at 75 percent of eligible costs for Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation. However, the President's order today increases the federal share for Public Assistance to 90 percent of eligible costs. For more information, media can contact the FEMA news desk.
