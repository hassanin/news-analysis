President Obama has requested that Federal mine safety officials provide an initial assessment of the cause of the recent coal mining disaster and suggest actions to prevent future tragedies. He will meet with Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and Mine Safety and Health Administrator Joe Main to discuss their findings. The President expects them to report on the cause of the explosion, the safety record of the Upper Branch mine, and ways the Federal government can improve safety enforcement. The briefing will cover safety issues, enforcement, and legal authorities.
