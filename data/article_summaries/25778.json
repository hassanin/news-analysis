The United States Census Bureau has released its official measures of the financial wellbeing of Americans in 2017, the first year of the Trump Administration. The data shows positive trends, with median household income increasing by 1.8 percent to reach $61,372, and the official poverty rate falling by 0.4 percentage points to 12.3 percent. Additionally, there were 1.7 million more people working in 2017 compared to 2016, and 2.4 million more people working full-time year-round. These improvements reflect the strength of the economy and job market. The report also highlights the reduction in food insecurity and the decline in the number of people relying on welfare programs. However, it is noted that the official poverty measure and median income measure have limitations and may not fully capture the progress made. The article suggests that an absolute consumption-based poverty measure would provide a more accurate representation of material wellbeing. It also emphasizes the importance of promoting work and self-sufficiency through welfare programs and economic policies to sustain progress in improving living standards.
