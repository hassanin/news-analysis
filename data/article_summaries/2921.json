On April 28, 2021, President Joe Biden will deliver his first speech to Congress, known as a Joint Address. It will take place at the United States Capitol at 9pm EDT. The speech can be watched live on various platforms, including WH.gov/live, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. The White House livestream will provide additional information from senior Administration officials and will feature ASL interpretation for accessibility. This address differs from the State of the Union address, which is typically given by a President after their first year in office.
