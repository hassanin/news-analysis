The White House Office of the First Lady held a press call to discuss the future of the Turnaround Arts program. The program aims to bring arts education to underperforming schools and has shown positive results in improving student engagement and academic performance. The President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities has partnered with the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to expand and implement the program nationwide. The First Lady will be making a major announcement about the future of Turnaround Arts during a talent show at the White House. The partnership between the committee and the Kennedy Center will provide access to resources, professional development, and a network of teaching artists to support the program. The goal is to highlight the value of arts education and inspire the next generation of artists.
