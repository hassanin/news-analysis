The President has rescinded the directive to the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate the resettlement of vulnerable Afghans, including those who worked with the United States. The President has also rescinded the directive to establish a Unified Coordination Group for increased federal response capacity and interagency coordination. The Secretary has already led efforts to process and resettle approximately 90,000 Afghan arrivals, and the last parolee left in September 2022. The U.S. Government will continue to welcome new arrivals with durable immigration status who will directly travel to their new communities. As a result, the Unified Coordination Group and increased federal response capacity are no longer necessary. This memorandum does not affect the responsibilities of federal departments and agencies under the law.
