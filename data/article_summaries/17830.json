President Obama spoke with several governors and FEMA Administrator Fugate to receive updates on the severe storms that impacted Midwest and Mid-Atlantic states. He expressed his condolences for the loss of life and concern for those affected by the destruction and power outages. The President directed FEMA to provide necessary support to state and local officials in impacted areas and asked the governors to identify additional needs. FEMA has deployed teams to West Virginia and Ohio and activated response coordination centers in Washington DC, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Additional support is being coordinated with other states.
