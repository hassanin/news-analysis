The article is a notice from the President on the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Belarus. The President declared a national emergency in 2006 due to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons undermining democratic processes or institutions. This includes human rights abuses, political repression, and public corruption. The flawed December 2010 Presidential election in Belarus and its aftermath have shown a regression in democratic governance and respect for human rights. The actions and policies of the Government of Belarus continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2006 will continue for another year.
