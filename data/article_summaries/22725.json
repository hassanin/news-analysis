In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims October 2011 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. He acknowledges the progress made in reducing domestic violence in America, but also highlights that three women die each day as a result of domestic violence. He emphasizes that domestic violence often goes unreported, making the statistics even more alarming. The article emphasizes the staggering ramifications of domestic violence, particularly on young women who are most vulnerable. Exposure to domestic violence puts individuals at risk of long-term physical, psychological, and emotional harm. Children who experience domestic violence are also at higher risk of academic failure, emotional disorders, substance abuse, and perpetuating the cycle of violence later in life. 

The Obama administration is actively working to curb domestic violence. They have implemented a coordinated strategy across federal agencies to prevent and stop violence against women. Programs have been established to help survivors become financially independent, prevent victims from being evicted or denied housing, and improve enforcement of protective orders. The Affordable Care Act ensures that women receive preventive health services, including domestic violence screening and counseling, at no additional cost. Additionally, insurance companies can no longer classify domestic violence as a pre-existing condition. 

The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act was reauthorized, providing communities with tools to identify and treat child abuse or neglect. It also supports shelters, service programs, and the National Domestic Violence Hotline. The article encourages victims, their loved ones, and concerned citizens to use the hotline for more information and assistance. The article emphasizes that ending domestic violence is not just the responsibility of the government, but of everyone. The "1is2many" initiative led by Vice President Joe Biden calls on men, women, parents, schools, and universities to play an active role in ending violence against youth and teaching children about healthy relationships. 

President Obama calls on all Americans to speak out against domestic violence and support local efforts to assist victims in finding the help and healing they need. The proclamation aims to raise awareness and ensure that no one suffers alone, while also promoting the idea of a safer tomorrow for all.
