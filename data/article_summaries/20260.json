President Obama is taking steps to protect American companies, consumers, and infrastructure from cyber threats while safeguarding privacy and civil liberties. He is proposing new legislation, the Personal Data Notification & Protection Act, to clarify and strengthen the obligations companies have to notify customers when their personal information has been exposed. The President is also working with financial institutions to provide consumers with free access to their credit scores to help spot identity theft. In addition, he is releasing a new legislative proposal, the Student Digital Privacy Act, to ensure that data collected in the educational context is used only for educational purposes. The President is also encouraging companies to commit to protecting student data and is providing tools and training to educators to help protect student privacy. The Department of Energy and the Federal Smart Grid Task Force are releasing a Voluntary Code of Conduct for utilities and third parties aimed at protecting electricity customer data. The Administration is also calling on Congress to consider legislation that enshrines clear principles for online consumer privacy. These actions build on previous steps taken by the President to support consumer privacy and fight identity theft.
