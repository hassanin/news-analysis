On January 13, 2017, the White House Office of the Press Secretary issued a notice stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process. This national emergency was initially declared on January 23, 1995, by President Bill Clinton through Executive Order 12947, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The national emergency was modified on August 20, 1998, through Executive Order 13099, which added four additional individuals who posed a threat to the Middle East peace process. On February 16, 2005, President George W. Bush further clarified the measures taken in Executive Order 12947 through Executive Order 13372. The notice declares that the terrorist activities still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency and the measures to deal with it will continue beyond January 23, 2017, for an additional year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
