The White House has announced a new public-private water innovation strategy to address the impacts of climate change on water resources. The strategy includes increasing the use of water-efficient technologies and promoting breakthrough research and development in water supply technology. The goal is to reduce water usage by 33% and achieve "pipe parity" by reducing the cost, energy usage, and greenhouse gas emissions of new water supply technology. The administration is also hosting a Roundtable on Water Innovation to engage with industry and public leaders, calling for commitments from the private sector to advance innovation and technology for water solutions. Additionally, the Department of the Interior is launching a new Center for Natural Resources Investment, offering funding opportunities for water and energy efficiency grants, and accepting applications for research and pilot projects to increase the usable supply of water in the US. The strategy aims to build a sustainable water future, create new businesses and jobs, and address the ongoing drought conditions in the western US. The Obama Administration has been taking actions to help communities suffering from drought, investing in drought resilience and response measures, and promoting collaboration and coordination among government agencies, academia, and the private sector.
