In this article, President Barack Obama is requesting that Congress expand the resources available to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through its New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) and approve other proposals to strengthen the IMF. He urges Congress to increase the U.S. quota subscription to the IMF by about $8 billion and expand the NAB by the United States and other countries up to $100 billion. Obama argues that this is crucial for U.S. economic interests, as many developing countries impacted by the global financial crisis are experiencing severe economic decline and a massive withdrawal of capital. He warns that if the IMF is not able to address the crisis, currencies could collapse, leading to steeper drops in U.S. growth, jobs, and exports. Obama emphasizes that this proposal was discussed at the international level at the G-20 meetings in London and after consultation with Congress. The U.S. expansion of the NAB would be part of an overall international expansion of $500 billion.
