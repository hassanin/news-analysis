President Trump is taking bold action to address America's opioid crisis, which is the worst in the country's history. He has set ambitious goals to reduce the supply of prescription opioids by one-third over the next three years and ensure that all federally-employed prescribers adhere to best practices within five years. The President has secured historic levels of funding from Congress to combat the crisis and has called for a reexamination of outdated Medicaid statutes that are limiting substance abuse treatment options. This comprehensive approach includes prevention, restricting the supply of illicit drugs, and providing treatment for those struggling with addiction. President Trump recognizes that local heroes, such as Manchester Fire Chief Dan Goonan, are key to rescuing their communities from addiction. The Trump administration is working closely with these heroes and others in New Hampshire to fight the crisis and build a brighter future for the country.
