President Donald Trump has sent a letter to the President of the Senate certifying that the inclusion of Montenegro in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will not increase the overall percentage share of the United States in NATO's common budgets. He also states that Montenegro's inclusion in NATO will not affect the United States' ability to meet its military requirements outside of the North Atlantic area.
