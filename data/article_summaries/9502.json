Yesterday, the US military conducted airstrikes against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) positions in Iraq, specifically targeting the Haditha Dam in Anbar province. The dam is an important source of hydroelectric power for Iraq and its destruction or release of water could cause catastrophic flooding, affecting thousands of Iraqis along the Euphrates valley. The US airstrikes were conducted in coordination with the Government of Iraq and aim to support Iraqi Security Forces in defending the dam from ISIL. These actions are in line with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.
