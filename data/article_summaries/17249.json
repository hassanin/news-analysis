This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama in 2014. The memorandum establishes a national goal and action plans to enhance the entry process for international travelers to the United States. The U.S. travel and tourism sector is important for the country's economy, and the memorandum aims to improve the experience of international visitors at U.S. airports. The Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security are directed to develop a national goal for improving service levels for international arrivals, including reducing wait times for passport control and other arrival procedures. The goal and action plans should be consistent with efforts that have already demonstrated improvements, such as at Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago O'Hare airports. The Secretaries are also instructed to identify opportunities for private and nonfederal public sector actors to help achieve the goal. Metrics will be established to measure progress, taking into account public health and national security considerations. The Secretaries will consult with relevant entities and advisory councils for input and advice. The memorandum does not impair existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits. Independent agencies are encouraged to comply with the requirements of the memorandum.
