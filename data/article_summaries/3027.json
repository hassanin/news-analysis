The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a bipartisan effort to ensure equal protection in the workforce for pregnant women, has been passed in the House of Representatives. This act aims to address the unfair treatment and potential dangers faced by pregnant workers who are often forced to choose between their health and a paycheck. The Act seeks to provide dignity, respect, and fairness to pregnant employees, particularly women of color who experience high rates of maternal mortality. The passage of this bill in the House is seen as a significant step forward, and the President urges the Senate to act quickly in passing the bill to support the health and economic security of pregnant workers and their families.
