The article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Donald Trump regarding the Fiduciary Duty Rule. The President directs the Secretary of Labor to review the rule and determine if it may adversely affect Americans' access to retirement information and financial advice. The examination will consider the impact on investors, potential disruptions in the retirement services industry, and the likelihood of increased litigation and costs for investors and retirees. If the rule is found to be inconsistent with the Administration's priorities, a proposed rule rescinding or revising it will be published for notice and comment. The memorandum also includes general provisions and instructions for implementation.
