Vice President Kamala Harris announced over $1.9 billion in new private sector commitments to create economic opportunity in northern Central America. This doubles the value of initial private sector investments in response to her Call to Action. The Call to Action was launched in May 2021 to address the root causes of migration from Central America. The new commitments bring the total private sector investments under this initiative to over $3.2 billion. The investments aim to create an ecosystem of opportunity and provide hope for people in the region to build safe and prosperous lives at home.

The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes that long-term development in northern Central America requires more than just the resources of the U.S. Government. Vice President Harris called upon the private sector to support inclusive economic growth in the region. Ten companies and organizations announced major new commitments, joining the 30 companies that have already invested since the launch of the Call to Action. These commitments include investments in sustainable food and ingredients, rural broadband networks, secondary education, digital access, manufacturing, telecommunications, and financial inclusion.

The Call to Action is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's comprehensive Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration. It focuses on promoting a reform agenda, digital and financial inclusion, food security and climate-smart agriculture, climate adaptation and clean energy, education and workforce development, and public health access. The initiative is facilitated through a public-private partnership between the State Department and the Partnership for Central America, in coordination with USAID. The Administration welcomes additional commitments from private companies to promote economic opportunity in northern Central America.
