The National Security Council (NSC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) held a press briefing to announce the release of the National Biodefense Strategy. The strategy aims to address the growing threat of bioweapons and biological threats from terrorist groups and adversary nations. The strategy establishes a Cabinet-level biodefense steering committee chaired by the HHS, which will coordinate the development and implementation of the policy. The NSC will handle the coordination of policy development, while operational efforts will be led by the HHS. Other departments involved include the Defense Department, the Agriculture Department, Homeland Security, and the EPA. The strategy will be reviewed annually to ensure its effectiveness and to address any gaps in capabilities. The briefing also touched on the vulnerability of the United States to a bio-attack, the importance of international cooperation, and the need for lab security and control. The officials did not provide specific details on the cost of the strategy or any new legislation that may be required. The briefing concluded with a reminder that the information shared was embargoed until 1:00 PM.
