The White House announced a declassification project that aims to identify and provide records related to human rights abuses committed under Argentina's dictatorship between 1975 and 1984. This project involves over 14 U.S. Government agencies and departments, including the CIA, FBI, and National Archives. The Secretary of State delivered an initial set of 1,000 declassified records in August 2016, and this second set includes approximately 500 newly declassified records. These records are available to the public online and will also be made available in hard copy at relevant Presidential Libraries. The declassification effort is being conducted through five major tasks, two of which are already complete, while the remaining three are ongoing. The goal of this project is to promote justice and reconciliation in Argentina and emphasize the importance of transparency and human rights.
