The declaration orders federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local response efforts. The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will coordinate all disaster relief efforts. The action aims to alleviate hardship and suffering caused by the emergency and provide appropriate assistance for emergency measures to save lives, protect property, and ensure public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide necessary equipment and resources for relief efforts. Debris removal and emergency protective measures will be provided at 75 percent federal funding. Justo Hern√°ndez has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. For further information, media should contact the FEMA News Desk.
