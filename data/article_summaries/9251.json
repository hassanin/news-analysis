In honor of National Foster Care Month, President Joe Biden has expressed gratitude for individuals and families who provide support to foster children. He acknowledges the challenges faced by young people in foster care, which have been further compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. To address these immediate needs, the administration is implementing federal programs that provide flexibility and support for youth aging out of foster care, helping them access critical services for education, employment, and transition to adulthood. President Biden emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to child and family well-being, highlighting the need to address long-standing challenges and injustices in the foster care system. He recognizes that communities of color, particularly Black and Native American communities, have been disproportionately affected by the system. Poverty is often conflated with neglect, leading to the removal of children from loving homes, and children with disabilities may not receive appropriate support. LGBTQ+ foster youth also face unique challenges. The administration is committed to addressing these issues, advancing equity and racial justice, and improving child and family well-being. The discretionary funding request for 2022 includes $100 million in grants to promote racial equity and prevent unnecessary child removals. National Foster Care Month is an opportunity to celebrate resource and kin families, foster youth, and biological parents working towards reunification. The president calls upon all Americans to reach out to children and youth in foster care, those at risk of entering foster care, and caregivers in their communities.
