President Biden has signed an Executive Order to implement the semiconductor funding in the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. This legislation aims to lower the costs of goods, create high-paying manufacturing jobs, and strengthen semiconductor supply chains. The Executive Order establishes the CHIPS Implementation Steering Council, which will coordinate the implementation of the CHIPS Act across the government. The Department of Commerce has also launched CHIPS.gov, a central resource for stakeholders and interested parties to access information about the $50 billion in manufacturing and research and development funds available through the Department. The Executive Order sets six primary priorities for implementation, including increasing semiconductor production and strengthening research and design leadership.
