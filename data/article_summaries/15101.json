The Presidential Policy Directive on Hostage Recovery Activities addresses the increasing threat of hostage-takings by terrorist organizations and criminal groups abroad. The policy aims to achieve the safe and rapid recovery of U.S. nationals taken hostage outside the United States, while also working to counter and diminish the global threat of hostage-taking and reducing the likelihood of U.S. nationals being taken hostage. The policy emphasizes that the United States will use every appropriate resource to gain the safe return of U.S. nationals, but will make no concessions to hostage-takers. The directive establishes processes to ensure close interagency coordination and significantly enhance engagement with hostages' families. It also highlights the importance of prevention and preparation, coordination with foreign governments, intelligence support, and prosecution of hostage-takers. The directive applies to both suspected and confirmed hostage-takings in which U.S. nationals or individuals with close links to the United States are abducted or held outside of the country.
