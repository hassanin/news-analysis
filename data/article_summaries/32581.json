Second Lady Karen Pence visited Grey Ghost Bakery, a military spouse and veteran-owned business in Charleston, South Carolina. She was greeted by the owners, Katherine and Manning, who gave her a tour of the bakery's production and shipping areas. Mrs. Pence also participated in a tasting of the bakery's cookies. She then had a discussion with Katherine, Manning, and the Small Business Administration's South Carolina District Director, R. Gregg White, who shared information about the SBA's connection to the business and their work with military spouses, veterans, and those impacted by the pandemic. Katherine and Manning worked with the SBA to start their business and received loans through the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan. The SBA offers various resources for military spouses and veterans, including the Boots to Business Reboot and Veterans' Business Outreach Centers programs. Mrs. Pence launched a campaign in 2018 to support military spouses and advocate for better career opportunities for them.
