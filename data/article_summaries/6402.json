President X surprised many people when he appointed Ambassador Susan Rice as his Domestic Policy Advisor, as she was primarily known for her expertise in foreign policy. However, after more than two years in the role, it is clear that Rice is highly capable and determined to achieve important goals for the American people. Under her leadership, significant accomplishments have been made, such as expanding and strengthening the Affordable Care Act, implementing a national mental health strategy, enabling Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices and capping the cost of insulin at $35. The administration has also taken historic actions to address gun violence, advance police reform, and reform marijuana policies. Equity has been prioritized throughout the federal government's work, and efforts have been made to make college more affordable, provide student debt relief, increase access to high-quality child care and long-term care, and commit to ending hunger and reducing diet-related disease by 2030. The administration has also reversed harmful immigration policies, reunited separated families, and improved the system of care for unaccompanied children. President X commends Rice for her dedicated service, valuable counsel, and friendship, and expresses gratitude to her family for their continued support.
