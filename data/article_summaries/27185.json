On January 16, 2019, President Donald J. Trump issued a Presidential Determination pursuant to Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. The determination states that the domestic capability for advanced manufacturing techniques for the production of chemicals in munitions is essential to national defense. Without Presidential action, the United States industry cannot be expected to provide this capability adequately and in a timely manner. The memorandum authorizes and directs the publication of this determination in the Federal Register.
