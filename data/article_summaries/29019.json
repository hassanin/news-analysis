President Donald J. Trump will award the Medal of Honor to Staff Sergeant Travis W. Atkins, United States Army, for his actions of June 1, 2007, in support of IRAQI FREEDOM. While serving in Iraq, Staff Sergeant Atkins engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a suspected insurgent who was attempting to detonate a bomb strapped to his body. Atkins tackled the insurgent, using his own body to shield his fellow soldiers from the explosion. His heroic actions saved the lives of three teammates. Atkins enlisted in the Army in 2000, deployed to Iraq in 2003, and was honorably discharged as a Sergeant. He re-enlisted in 2005 and was promoted to Staff Sergeant in 2007. Atkins is survived by his son and his parents. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who demonstrate great personal bravery or self-sacrifice above and beyond the call of duty.
