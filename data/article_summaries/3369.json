President Biden spoke at a press conference about the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which he described as a historic agreement to fight inflation and lower costs for American families. The bill aims to lower healthcare costs, invest in clean energy solutions, restore fairness to the tax code, and reduce the federal deficit. It has garnered support from climate leaders, inflation hawks, and progressive leaders. The bill includes provisions to allow Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, lock in lower healthcare premiums under the Affordable Care Act, invest in securing the energy future and addressing the climate crisis, require large corporations to pay a 15 percent corporate minimum tax, and reduce the federal deficit by over $300 billion. It does not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. President Biden urged Congress to pass the bill and emphasized the positive state of the economy, citing record job market, record unemployment, and investments in America by businesses, including in semiconductor and electric vehicle industries. He concluded by stating that passing the bill would benefit the American people and the country as a whole.
