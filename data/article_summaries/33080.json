On Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Awareness Day, the US government is highlighting the symptoms and warning signs of PTSD and pledging to help those who suffer from it receive the necessary support and treatment. It is estimated that 8 million adults experience PTSD each year. The government is prioritizing mental and behavioral health and increasing access to mental health treatment. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act was signed into law last year to make inpatient treatment and evidence-based options more accessible for those with mental illness. The government is also working with healthcare practitioners to provide training and education on evidence-based treatments for PTSD. Special attention is given to service members and veterans, with efforts being made to ensure they have access to resources and care during their transition back into civilian life. The President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS) Initiative was launched to develop a comprehensive public health roadmap for improving veterans' quality of life and preventing suicide. The initiative aims to engage public and private stakeholders to understand the causes of suicide and identify warning signs early. It encourages all Americans who have faced trauma or stress to talk about their experiences and seeks to remove the stigma associated with mental health challenges.
