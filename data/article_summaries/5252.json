President Biden held a meeting with small-business owners to discuss the role of small businesses in America's economic recovery. Small businesses account for over 40% of the US GDP, create two-thirds of new jobs, and employ nearly half of the private sector workers. The American Rescue Plan has contributed to the creation of more small businesses and jobs, with a record 5.4 million new businesses started last year. The trend is expected to continue, and the boom has been particularly strong for entrepreneurs of color. The President highlighted the success stories of Jennifer, Jeff, Nicolas, Eddie, and Daniel, who were able to start or expand their businesses with support from initiatives like the Child Care Tax Credit and the Small Business Administration. President Biden criticized the Republican plan, led by Senator Rick Scott, for potentially raising taxes on small-business owners and not holding big corporations accountable. The President's administration aims to make it easier for small businesses to start and succeed by expanding access to capital, providing technical assistance programs, directing government contracts to small businesses, and ensuring large corporations pay their fair share.
