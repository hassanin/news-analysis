The White House Press Secretary released a statement expressing disappointment in Republicans in the Senate for blocking a bill that would provide aid for states and jobless benefits for Americans. The legislation would also save the jobs of teachers, firefighters, and police officers, as well as provide tax cuts for businesses that keep research and development jobs in the United States. Despite offering compromises, Democrats were unable to gain Republican support for the bill. The President urges Congress to pass the bill to provide relief for American families during the economic downturn.
