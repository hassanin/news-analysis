The Senate is commended for taking a significant step towards ending Obamacare. This vote demonstrates that inaction is not acceptable, and it allows the legislative process to proceed as planned in order to create a bill that reduces costs and provides more choices for all Americans. The Senate must now pass the bill and send it to the President's desk to ultimately bring an end to the Obamacare situation.
