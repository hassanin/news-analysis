The National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, delivered a speech discussing the Biden administration's international economic policy. Sullivan outlined four fundamental challenges that the United States faced: the hollowing out of America's industrial base, adapting to new geopolitical and security competition, addressing the accelerating climate crisis, and tackling inequality. To address these challenges, the Biden administration is pursuing a modern industrial and innovation strategy both domestically and with international partners. The strategy focuses on investing in economic and technological strength, promoting diversified and resilient global supply chains, setting high standards for labor, environment, and technology, and deploying capital for public goods like climate and health. Sullivan emphasized the importance of working with partners to ensure capacity building, resilience, and inclusiveness. The administration aims to establish innovative international economic partnerships that tackle the core challenges of the time, such as clean energy transition, tax fairness, labor rights, and supply chain resilience. The strategy also involves mobilizing trillions in investment into emerging economies and protecting foundational technologies. Sullivan highlighted the need for a new international economic system that works for wage-earners, industries, climate, national security, and the world's poorest and most vulnerable countries. The success of this strategy requires cooperation, transparency, and a commitment to overcoming barriers. Sullivan called for bipartisan support from Congress and emphasized the importance of infrastructure, innovation, and clean energy investments. He concluded by stating that by working together, the United States can lift up its people, communities, and industries, as well as its friends and partners around the world.
