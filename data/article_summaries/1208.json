In a press briefing, White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre discussed the ongoing budget negotiations and the need to raise the debt ceiling. She emphasized that default is off the table and that the only way forward is through a bipartisan budget agreement. While there are areas of disagreement, the President and Speaker McCarthy had a productive meeting and their teams will continue to discuss the path forward. Jean-Pierre highlighted the severe consequences of a default, including job losses, a recession, and damage to the economy. She also mentioned that President Biden has made tackling the mental health crisis, particularly among youth, a top priority and announced the development of a new interagency task force on kids' online health and safety. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy also released a new advisory on social media and youth mental health.
