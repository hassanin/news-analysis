The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released the United States Government's annual estimates of coca cultivation and cocaine production potential in Bolivia. According to the estimates, Bolivia is the third largest producer of cocaine in the world. In 2019, Bolivia's coca cultivation increased by 28 percent to 42,180 hectares, while cocaine production potential increased by 20 percent to 301 metric tons. The Yungas region is the largest coca cultivation area in Bolivia, followed by the Chapare region. The cultivation exceeded the limit set by the Bolivian government by 92 percent. ONDCP Director Jim Carroll has stated that cocaine production in Bolivia poses a serious threat to both the United States and Bolivia, and urges the incoming government to take immediate action to reverse this trend. The Trump Administration is willing to work with Bolivia's new leadership to address this issue.
