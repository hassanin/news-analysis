President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed August 18-24, 2019, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. In this proclamation, he acknowledges the important role that civilian employers play in supporting the National Guard and Reserve, who make significant contributions to the economy and national defense. These employers provide job security, encouragement, and stability to service members and their families during times of deployment. President Trump calls on all Americans, as well as state and local officials, private organizations, and military commanders, to express their gratitude and observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
