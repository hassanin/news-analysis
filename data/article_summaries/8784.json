In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recognizes the importance of older Americans and their contributions to society. He acknowledges the hardships they have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, with older adults, particularly those from communities of color, being disproportionately affected. Despite these challenges, older Americans have shown resilience and have supported their communities as essential workers, volunteers, and donors. The Biden Administration is committed to ensuring the well-being of older adults and supports issues such as Medicare, Social Security, affordable prescription drugs, and long-term care options. The American Rescue Plan prioritizes older Americans by implementing a national vaccination program and providing support to skilled nursing facilities and home and community-based services. The plan also allocates funding to programs authorized under the Older Americans Act, which connect older adults and their caregivers to essential services. Additionally, the plan enhances the Elder Justice Act and ensures the safety of all adults as they age. President Biden proclaims May 2021 as Older Americans Month and encourages Americans of all ages to celebrate and support older Americans throughout the year.
