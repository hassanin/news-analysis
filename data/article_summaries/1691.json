President Biden's administration has proposed new vehicle pollution standards to make all vehicles, including gas-powered cars and heavy-duty trucks, cleaner and more efficient. These standards would cut nearly 10 billion tons of CO2 emissions and save consumers an average of $12,000 over the lifetime of a vehicle. They would also reduce reliance on imported oil. The private sector, including the American auto industry, has invested over $120 billion in American-made electric vehicles and battery supply chains since Biden took office. The administration aims to secure American leadership in the clean transportation future and out-compete China. The proposed standards would spur the adoption of pollution-reducing technology for nearly all road vehicles and reinforce Biden's agenda to build a clean transportation future made in America. The United States is making progress towards the goal of having at least 50% of new passenger cars and light trucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles. Electric car sales have tripled, and there are over 130,000 public chargers available across the country. The administration has also invested in the development of a national charging network and the transition of school buses and the U.S. Postal Service to electric vehicles. The private sector has committed over $120 billion to the American-made electric vehicle and battery supply chain. President Biden has taken actions to ensure a smooth transition to clean vehicles and protect future generations from the impacts of climate change.
