On June 26, 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order regarding the continuation of the President's National Council for the American Worker and the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board. The order amends a previous executive order to extend the termination date of the National Council for the American Worker to September 30, 2021, unless further extended by the President. The American Workforce Policy Advisory Board is also continued until September 30, 2021. The order specifies that it does not impair the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also states that it should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
