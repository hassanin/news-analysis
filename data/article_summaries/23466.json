The President is pleased that the Senate has taken action to move forward on nominees who have been waiting a long time for a vote. He has nominated leaders to fill important positions, but they have remained unfilled due to political reasons, not because the nominees were unqualified. The President thanks Senators from both parties for working together to find a path forward for these nominees. He hopes that Congress will continue to cooperate to address other urgent middle-class priorities, such as immigration reform and keeping student loan interest rates low.
