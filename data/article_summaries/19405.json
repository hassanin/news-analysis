President Barack Obama has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans. This emergency was initially declared in 2001 and is being extended due to the ongoing threat posed by extremist violence and obstructionist activity in the region. The President has determined that this emergency is necessary to protect the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.
