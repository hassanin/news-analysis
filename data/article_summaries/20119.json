The United States has issued a statement condemning the offensive operations conducted by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in and around Abyei town, as well as the Presidential decree dissolving the Abyei Administration. The US considers these actions to be disproportionate and irresponsible, and they violate the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and threaten to escalate the situation towards war. The US is calling on the SAF to immediately cease all offensive operations and withdraw its forces from Abyei. Failure to do so could hinder the normalization of relations between Sudan and the United States and impede progress on critical issues for Sudan's future. The US is urging President Bashir and First Vice President Kiir to meet and find a way forward that restores calm, upholds the CPA, and commits both sides to a negotiated political settlement on the future status of the Abyei Area.
