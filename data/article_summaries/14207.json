The United States strongly condemns the mass murder of Ethiopian Christians by ISIL-affiliated terrorists in Libya. The US expresses condolences to the victims' families and support to the Ethiopian government and people. The terrorists' act of killing these men solely because of their faith highlights their brutal and senseless nature. This incident emphasizes the need for a political resolution in Libya to unite the country against terrorist groups. Despite the terrorists' attempts to divide religious communities, people of different faiths have coexisted for centuries in the Middle East and Africa. The United States stands with all faiths in the face of such barbarity. These acts aim to test the world's resolve, but they cannot extinguish the inherent moral decency that unites humanity and will ultimately lead to the terrorists' downfall.
