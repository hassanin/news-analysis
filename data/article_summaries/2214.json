First Lady Jill Biden will be visiting Augusta and Pittsburgh to announce commitments to equitable workforce development from various collaborators. These commitments are part of President Biden's Investing in America agenda, which aims to create good-paying jobs and make historic investments in these cities. In Augusta, there will be new registered apprenticeship programs and over $1 million in employer investments in workforce pipelines. Five major regional employers have committed to developing the workforce, and training providers are expanding programs for skill development in clean energy manufacturing, nuclear energy, construction, cyber, and advanced manufacturing. Pittsburgh, on the other hand, will create over 1,000 new jobs and expand apprenticeship programs in industries related to infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, high-speed internet, and clean energy. Education and training organizations will offer pre-apprenticeships, registered apprenticeships, and other earn-and-learn opportunities to more than 500 additional workers. Local education institutions will develop pathways into robotics, cybersecurity, and advanced manufacturing. Additionally, efforts will be made to remove barriers to employment and increase recruitment in underserved communities.
