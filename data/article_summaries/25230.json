The Senate tax bill would reduce income taxes for people at every income level, including those who don't pay taxes. The Joint Committee on Taxation has concluded this. However, some headlines are claiming that the tax cuts would make the poor worse off. The report includes a table that shows how the bill would affect federal revenues and spending by income group. It appears that those making less than $40,000 will be negatively affected, while those making more than $100,000 will benefit. However, it's important to note that "spending" is included in the calculation because the bill includes the repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate. When Republicans demanded a table that only looked at the impact of the tax cuts, the result showed that every income group would receive tax relief, including those who don't pay taxes due to refundable tax credits. Additionally, none of these tables account for the potential economic boost, new jobs, and increased income that may result from the tax cuts.
