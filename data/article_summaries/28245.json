The White House recently held its annual Congressional Picnic, modeled after Central Park in New York City. The event included activities such as corn hole, sailing boats in the fountain, and riding the carousel. Vice President Mike Pence addressed the crowd and shared a personal story about attending the picnic when his daughters were young. White House interns had the opportunity to volunteer for the event, performing tasks such as handing out water and greeting guests. The Congressional Picnic is a long-standing tradition dating back to President Harry S. Truman's administration.
