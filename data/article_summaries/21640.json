On February 7, 2006, President Barack Obama declared a national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to C么te d'Ivoire. This was done under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States caused by the conflict in C么te d'Ivoire. The President ordered measures to block the property of certain individuals contributing to the conflict.

The situation in or in relation to C么te d'Ivoire has been addressed by the United Nations Security Council and has resulted in the massacre of civilians, human rights abuses, political violence, unrest, and attacks against international peacekeeping forces. Although the Government of C么te d'Ivoire has made progress in advancing democratic freedoms and economic development since President Alassane Ouattara took office in May 2011, the situation still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.

Therefore, President Obama has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
