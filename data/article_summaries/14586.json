President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring December as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about the dangers of impaired driving, improving screening methods, and providing law enforcement with the necessary tools and training to combat drunk, drugged, and distracted driving. Impaired drivers are responsible for almost one-third of all deaths from motor vehicle crashes in the United States, taking around 30 lives each day. The proclamation encourages Americans to designate a non-drinking driver, plan ahead for alternative transportation, or make arrangements to stay with family and friends before consuming alcohol. It also highlights the need for education and prevention programs to teach young people and the public about the risks of impaired driving. The proclamation concludes by urging all Americans to drive sober, buckle up, and avoid distractions while driving in order to save lives and keep families safe.
