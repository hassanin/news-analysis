Michael Collins was a dedicated public servant who contributed to the United States in various roles, including the Air Force, NASA, the State Department, and the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. While he is often remembered as the astronaut who orbited the Moon while Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong walked on its surface, he emphasized the importance of collaboration in achieving great goals. Collins also highlighted the fragility of Earth and urged its preservation. Despite his many accomplishments and titles, he preferred to be called Mike. Our thoughts are with his family.
