The Departments of Energy and Transportation in the United States have announced new actions to upgrade the country's power infrastructure. The Department of Energy is introducing financial tools to support the construction of high-voltage electric transmission lines, while the Department of Transportation is issuing guidance to facilitate the siting of transmission lines using existing rights-of-way. An independent analysis confirms the importance of investing in the electricity grid, identifying over 20 major transmission projects that could create more than 600,000 new jobs. Additionally, the announcements reflect the government's commitment to combat climate change and create sustainable jobs. The Energy Secretary emphasizes the need to improve resilience and expand transmission capacity to move clean energy efficiently. The Transportation Secretary highlights the use of public highways and transportation rights-of-way to speed up the siting and permitting process for transmission lines. This can generate revenue, reduce costs, promote energy security, and create local jobs. An independent analysis estimates that with financing and siting tools, these transmission projects could create hundreds of thousands of jobs and unlock around 60,000 megawatts of new clean energy capacity. A broad stakeholder coalition has also formed a Grid Investments Advisory Council, supporting the expansion and modernization of the grid with a focus on smart grid technologies.
