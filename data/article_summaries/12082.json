This article is a Presidential Memorandum from June 2, 2010, issued by President Barack Obama. The memorandum addresses the extension of benefits to same-sex domestic partners of federal employees. The President highlights the systemic inequality that has denied LGBT employees equal access to rights and benefits enjoyed by their colleagues. The President directs executive departments and agencies to review the benefits they provide and identify those that can be extended to LGBT employees and their partners and families. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provides a report recommending the extension of all identified benefits. The memorandum includes immediate actions to extend benefits, such as clarifying definitions of "child" and "family members" to include same-sex domestic partners and their children, proposing rules to include same-sex domestic partners in noncompetitive appointments and retiree benefits, and clarifying eligibility for various allowances and payments. The memorandum also instructs agencies to provide the same level of benefits to same-sex domestic partners and their children as provided to spouses and their children. It establishes a continuing obligation for agencies to provide new benefits to same-sex domestic partners and their children. The OPM is tasked with monitoring compliance and providing reports on progress. The memorandum emphasizes that it should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It also states that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities. The Director of OPM is authorized and directed to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
