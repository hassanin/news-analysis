The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new efforts to promote responsible artificial intelligence (AI) that protects individuals' rights and safety. The administration recognizes the potential of AI but also acknowledges the need to manage its risks. They have taken actions such as creating a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, establishing an AI Risk Management Framework, and addressing national security concerns. The administration also recently convened representatives from leading AI companies to discuss cyber threats and best practices for securing AI systems. Today's announcements include initiatives to advance responsible AI and a listening session with workers to understand their experiences with automated technologies.
