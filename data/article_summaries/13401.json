The Obama Administration has outlined how states can receive relief from certain provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also known as No Child Left Behind (NCLB), in exchange for efforts to close achievement gaps and promote accountability. States can request flexibility from specific NCLB mandates if they are transitioning to a system aligned with college- and career-ready standards, developing differentiated accountability systems, and implementing reforms to support effective instruction and school leadership. The goal is to support local and state education reform while maintaining accountability. The package comes nearly a decade after NCLB became law and four years after it was due to be rewritten. Education Secretary Arne Duncan emphasizes the importance of giving states and districts flexibility to address their educational challenges while still holding schools accountable for preparing students for college and careers. States have already been leading the way in pursuing reform, including adopting college- and career-ready standards and implementing teacher and principal evaluation systems. This flexibility package was developed under the waiver authority granted to the U.S. Department of Education under the ESEA, and its impact will begin in the 2011-2012 school year.
