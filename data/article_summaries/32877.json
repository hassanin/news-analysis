President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the Commonwealth of Virginia and has ordered Federal assistance to supplement recovery efforts in areas affected by Tropical Storm Michael. Federal funding will be available to State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The funding will be provided on a cost-sharing basis. Hazard mitigation measures will also be eligible for funding. Donald L. Keldsen has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional areas may be designated for assistance once the assessments are completed. For further information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
