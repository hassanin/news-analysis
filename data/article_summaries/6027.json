The Biden-Harris administration is focused on growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, rather than the top down. They have implemented various initiatives, such as the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act, to generate historic investments in cities and towns across the country. However, federal investments and subsidies in underserved communities have historically fallen short of achieving their goals. To address this, the administration is releasing a new policy memorandum to all federal agencies that outlines actions they can take to advance equitable development in American cities and urban communities. The Interagency Community Investment Committee (ICIC) is also announcing new actions to strengthen how federal community investment programs serve historically underserved communities, including communities of color, low-income communities, rural areas, and Tribal communities. These actions build upon President Biden and Vice President Harris's commitment to creating economic opportunity and advancing equity across the Federal Government. The administration is also releasing a policy memorandum that directs agencies to undertake efforts to strengthen urban equitable development policies and practices, such as advancing community wealth building projects and preventing displacement. The memorandum provides principles to guide agencies on actions they can take to advance urban equitable development. Additionally, the ICIC is taking actions to improve the operational coordination of federal investment programs to maximize their impact for underserved communities. The ICIC members include the Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of the Treasury, Department of Transportation, and the Small Business Administration.
