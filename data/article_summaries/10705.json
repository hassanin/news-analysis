The White House has issued a Presidential Memorandum to promote economic competitiveness and innovation while safeguarding privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties in the domestic use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). The Federal Aviation Administration has already authorized the testing of UAS at six sites around the country. UAS have the potential to transform various industries, such as agriculture, law enforcement, and search and rescue. The Presidential Memorandum requires federal agencies to ensure that their policies and procedures align with limitations set forth in the memorandum, and to prohibit the collection, use, retention, or dissemination of data in any manner that would violate the First Amendment or discriminate against individuals. It also includes requirements for effective oversight and transparency, with agencies being required to publish information on their policies and procedures. The memorandum also mandates that agencies examine their UAS policies and procedures regularly to keep up with technological developments. The Department of Commerce, through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, will initiate a multi-stakeholder engagement process to develop a framework for privacy, accountability, and transparency concerning the commercial and private use of UAS.
