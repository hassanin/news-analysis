President Biden addressed the public from the North Lawn and discussed the progress made in the fight against COVID-19. He highlighted the significant decrease in cases and deaths since he took office, particularly among senior citizens. He emphasized the success of the vaccination effort, with over 67% of seniors fully vaccinated and an 80% drop in deaths among seniors. Biden also mentioned the importance of equity in vaccine distribution, noting that more Latinos and African American seniors have been vaccinated compared to white seniors. 

The President announced that the CDC has updated its guidelines, stating that fully vaccinated individuals no longer need to wear masks outdoors, except in crowded settings. He encouraged those who have not yet been vaccinated, especially younger individuals, to get vaccinated for the sake of their own lives and the lives of others. Biden expressed gratitude to the CDC and urged Americans to continue following guidance and getting vaccinated. He also mentioned his intention to discuss further plans for Independence Day celebrations in the coming week. 

During the question and answer session, Biden clarified that the new guidance applies to fully vaccinated individuals who are outdoors and not in large crowds. He explained that the science indicates this is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the virus. When asked about meeting with Vladimir Putin, Biden said he would discuss that on another day. Regarding India's COVID-19 crisis, he mentioned that the US is providing immediate assistance, including medication and machinery for vaccine production, and is working on sending vaccines to India once there is a sufficient supply for the US and other countries in need.
