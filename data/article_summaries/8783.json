The Department of Veterans Affairs is expanding disability and health benefits to veterans suffering from nine rare respiratory cancers, as announced in the State of the Union address. This is aimed at addressing the harms that come from hazardous exposures, such as burn pits on base. The decision is guided by science and driven by a desire to ensure timely access to benefits for veterans. Supporting veterans is a critical part of the Unity Agenda proposed by the administration, and bipartisan legislation is urged to comprehensively address toxic exposures and provide necessary benefits.
