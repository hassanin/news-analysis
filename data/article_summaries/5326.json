On June 16, 2022, the President signed two laws. The first law designates a facility of the United States Postal Service in Saint Clair, Michigan, as the Corporal Jeffrey Robert Standfest Post Office Building. The second law, known as the "Supreme Court Police Parity Act of 2022," authorizes the Marshal of the Supreme Court and Supreme Court Police to protect immediate family members of the Chief Justice, any Associate Justice, or any officer of the Supreme Court. The President thanked Representatives McClain, Bergman, Huizenga, Meijer, Moolenaar, Upton, Walberg, Andy Levin, Stevens, and Dingell for their leadership in passing the first law and Senators Cornyn and Coons for their leadership in passing the second law.
