The executive order "Identifying and Reducing Tax Regulatory Burdens" requires the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget to review and potentially revise tax-related regulations. According to OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, implementing this order would have minimal impact on costs and revenues for the government. The order aims to promote a simple, fair, efficient, and pro-growth tax system and eliminate unnecessarily burdensome tax regulations. The order is expected to have a minimal impact on obligations, outlays, and revenues for the government over the next five fiscal years. The Department of the Treasury and the Executive Office of the President are the agencies expected to be affected by this order.
