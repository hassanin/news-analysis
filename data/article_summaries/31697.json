President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring February 2019 as National African American History Month. The proclamation recognizes the contributions of African Americans throughout American history, highlighting their achievements, resilience, and impact on society. The theme for this year is "Black Migrations," focusing on the challenges and successes of African Americans as they moved from the agricultural South to centers of industry in the North, Midwest, and West. The proclamation also mentions inspirational figures such as Annie Turnbo Malone, Mary McLeod Bethune, and Booker T. Washington, who empowered others and encouraged them to overcome obstacles. The proclamation acknowledges the significant cultural, scientific, political, and economic contributions of African Americans and calls upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all citizens to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities.
