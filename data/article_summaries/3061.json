The United States has welcomed a 72-hour ceasefire in the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The ceasefire follows confidence building measures secured during the visit of Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to the DRC and Rwanda. The armed forces and non-state armed groups have stopped fighting to allow for the withdrawal of forces from the locality of Mushaki and the RP1030 road. The DRC and Rwanda have expressed support for the ceasefire proposed by the U.S. to protect civilians and de-escalate tensions. The U.S. Government will monitor the activities of armed forces and non-state armed groups during the ceasefire using its intelligence and diplomatic resources. The United States also supports the resumption of the Nairobi and Luanda processes, which aim to address the factors contributing to the ongoing crisis.
