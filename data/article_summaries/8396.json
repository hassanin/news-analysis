During a press briefing at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Bali, Indonesia, President Biden discussed his recent meetings with NATO and G7 leaders. He mentioned his discussions with President Duda of Poland and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, in which they agreed to support Poland's investigation into an explosion near the Ukrainian border. The President expressed sympathy for the two people who were killed and emphasized the need to determine what happened. The leaders also discussed the ongoing Russian missile attacks in Ukraine, condemning the brutality and inhumanity of these actions. Despite calls for de-escalation at the G20, Russia has chosen to escalate the conflict in Ukraine. President Biden affirmed the United States' full support for Ukraine and its commitment to providing them with the necessary capacity to defend themselves. When asked if the missile was fired from Russia, the President stated that preliminary information suggests otherwise, but a full investigation is needed to confirm. Poland has suggested having a meeting of ambassadors, possibly invoking Article 4 or 5 from NATO.
