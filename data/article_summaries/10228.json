In this press gaggle, Press Secretary Josh Earnest discusses two main topics. First, he mentions that the World Health Organization has declared an end to the most recent outbreak of the Ebola virus in Liberia. He praises the collaborative efforts of the United States, military, doctors, and development workers in containing the epidemic and saving lives. However, he emphasizes the need for continued vigilance against potential future flare-ups of the disease. Second, Earnest announces that the Department of Defense has transferred 10 Guantanamo detainees to Oman, bringing the total population at Guantanamo to 93. He states that this transfer is a significant milestone in the effort to close the facility and highlights the support and assistance provided by various countries in repatriating or resettling detainees. Earnest also addresses questions about the remaining detainees at Guantanamo, the concerns of House Republicans about the closure of the facility, and the President's plan to present a strategy for closing Guantanamo to Congress. He briefly discusses other topics such as the recent attacks in Jakarta, the movie "Thirteen Hours" about the Benghazi attacks, Medicaid expansion, and the situation in Chicago regarding police shootings and violence.
