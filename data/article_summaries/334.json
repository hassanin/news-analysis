This article discusses an executive order issued by President Joe Biden to advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for Native American students in the United States. The order acknowledges the unique political and legal relationship between the United States and federally recognized Tribal Nations. It recognizes the historical harm caused by past educational policies that aimed to assimilate Native American students into mainstream American culture. The order highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Native American communities and the need to address educational inequities, including the digital divide and lack of resources for remote learning. The order emphasizes the importance of early childhood and K-12 education, as well as the role of Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) in providing high-quality education, preserving Native languages and cultural traditions, and supporting Tribal economic development. The order establishes the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Native Americans and Strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities, which will be co-chaired by the Secretaries of Education, Interior, and Labor. The initiative will collaborate with Tribal Nations, TCUs, and other stakeholders to address challenges faced by Native American students and promote educational opportunities. It also establishes the National Advisory Council on Indian Education to provide advice and guidance to the initiative. The order includes provisions for data collection, reporting, and collaboration among agencies to advance its goals. It revokes a previous executive order and provides definitions for key terms used in the order.
