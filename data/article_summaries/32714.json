In Proclamation 9645, issued on September 24, 2017, President Donald Trump recognized the need for enhanced vetting capabilities and processes for individuals seeking entry into the United States. The proclamation established a baseline of information required from foreign governments to assess whether individuals from certain countries pose a national security threat. Entry suspensions and limitations were placed on nationals of countries that failed to meet the baseline criteria. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, was directed to review whether countries have met the baseline criteria and make recommendations regarding the continuation, modification, termination, or supplementation of the entry restrictions. The first report, submitted by the Secretary of Homeland Security on March 30, 2018, recommended the termination of entry restrictions for nationals of one country, Chad, due to marked improvements in its identity-management and information-sharing practices. However, other countries subject to entry restrictions did not make sufficient improvements. The proclamation was modified to remove the restrictions and limitations on nationals of Chad, effective April 13, 2018.
