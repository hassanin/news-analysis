President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance in Guam following Typhoon Mawar. Under the president's major disaster declaration, federal funding was initially set at 75% of the total eligible costs for public assistance, hazard mitigation, and other needs assistance. However, the president has now increased the federal share to 90% of the total eligible costs. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
