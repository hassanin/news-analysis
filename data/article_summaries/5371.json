President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has transmitted three agreements to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate regarding the implementation of United States economic assistance to the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). These agreements include the 2023 Amended Compact, which commits the United States to provide $1.6 billion over 20 years in grant assistance and $700 million in new Compact Trust Fund contributions to the RMI. The 2023 FPA ensures oversight and accountability for the use of taxpayer funds, while the 2023 TFA restructures the Compact Trust Fund to provide support or distributions to eligible recipients. These agreements highlight the long-term commitment of the United States to the RMI and strengthen the bilateral relationship, contributing to economic prosperity and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
