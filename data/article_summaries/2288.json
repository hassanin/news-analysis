President Biden will issue an Executive Order on Securing Access to Reproductive and Other Healthcare Services. This order will build on previous actions taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to protect access to reproductive healthcare services and defend women's fundamental rights. The President will kick off the Vice President's first meeting of the Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, where the Cabinet will discuss their progress and the path forward to address the women's health crisis following the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

The Executive Order will announce actions to establish an interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, which will be co-chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of the White House Gender Policy Council. This Task Force will coordinate and drive efforts across the Federal government to protect access to reproductive healthcare services and defend reproductive rights. Various offices across the White House and several Federal agencies will also serve on the Task Force.

These announcements build on the Administration's previous actions to protect access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion and contraception, in response to the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. President Biden continues to call on Congress to codify the right to abortion into federal law and has expressed support for changing filibuster rules to codify Roe v. Wade. The Administration has also released Statements of Administration Policy supporting bills such as the Women's Health Protection Act and the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act.
