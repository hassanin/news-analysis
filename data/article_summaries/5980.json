President Biden met with six DACA recipients working in health care, education, and agriculture to hear about their experiences during the pandemic. He expressed his support for Dreamers, TPS holders, farmworkers, and other essential immigrant workers. The President and the Dreamers also discussed the importance of immigration reform and the White House's backing for the Dream and Promise Act and the Farm Workforce Modernization Act. These bills have bipartisan support and are currently awaiting action in the Senate.
