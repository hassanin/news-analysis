The Biden-Harris Administration has released the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, which includes over 100 new actions to combat antisemitism. The strategy aims to raise awareness of antisemitism and its threat to American democracy, protect Jewish communities, reverse the normalization of antisemitism, and promote cross-community solidarity. The United States has seen an increase in antisemitic incidents, with American Jews being the victims of 63% of reported religiously motivated hate crimes. The strategy involves various stakeholders, including government agencies, civil society, educational institutions, the tech sector, and religious communities, to mobilize against antisemitism. The administration has also announced commitments from organizations across the private sector, civil society, and higher education to counter antisemitism. The strategy consists of four pillars: increasing awareness and understanding of antisemitism, improving safety and security for Jewish communities, reversing the normalization of antisemitism, and building cross-community solidarity to counter hate. The government plans to invest in education about antisemitism and the Holocaust, improve threat information sharing, and hold social media platforms accountable for spreading hate speech. It also aims to counter antisemitism in schools and on college campuses and promote equitable access to government programs for religious communities. The strategy emphasizes the United States' commitment to Israel's right to exist and security.
