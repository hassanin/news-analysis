President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations, which was declared in Executive Order 13581 on July 24, 2011, is to continue beyond July 24, 2017. The President believes that these criminal organizations pose a significant threat to the stability of international political and economic systems, and that they are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States. He believes that these organizations are entrenched in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, which weakens democratic institutions, degrades the rule of law, and undermines economic markets. The President has determined that the activities of these organizations continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
