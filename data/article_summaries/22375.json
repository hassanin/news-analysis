The White House has announced that President Obama applauds the Senate's passing of the Food Safety Modernization Act. This legislation aims to enhance food safety by increasing inspections of food manufacturing facilities and requiring them to take preventive measures to reduce the risk of outbreaks and foodborne illnesses. The President urges the House to quickly act on this bill, as they have previously shown their commitment to improving food safety. The Senate's bipartisan support for the bill is also commended.
