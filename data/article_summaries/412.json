White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden and U.S. Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona hosted a livestreamed event with higher education leaders to introduce a new Department of Education report called "Strategies for Increasing Diversity and Opportunity in Higher Education." The report urges states and higher education leaders to focus on outreach, admissions, financial aid, and college completion to promote diversity on college campuses. The report was prompted by President Biden's request to the Department to highlight effective practices for creating inclusive student bodies after recent Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action. Tanden and Cardona emphasized the administration's commitment to expanding access to education and thanked participants from various higher education institutions for their efforts to promote diversity in line with the law.
