In this article, the White House Press Secretary criticizes House Republicans for voting to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. They argue that this $1 trillion tax cut will be paid for by cutting investments in critical programs that are necessary for job creation and economic strength. The Press Secretary states that at a time when tough choices need to be made to reduce the deficit, the country cannot afford another massive tax break for the top two percent of Americans. They argue that this approach has been tried before and did not lead to economic growth or strengthen the middle class. Additionally, the Press Secretary highlights that the Republican plan would raise taxes on 25 million middle-class families. The President has called for a bill that would extend tax cuts for 98% of Americans and prevent taxes from increasing by an average of $2,200 for the typical family at the beginning of the following year. The President urges House Republicans to stop holding the middle-class tax cuts hostage and emphasizes the need for the House to follow the Senate's lead and pass the bill.
