President Biden has issued a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to coordinate a new effort across the federal government to develop and issue the first-ever interagency national research action plan on Long COVID. The plan will focus on prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and provision of services for individuals experiencing Long COVID and associated conditions. The memorandum also instructs HHS to issue a report outlining services and supports across federal agencies to assist people experiencing Long COVID, COVID-related loss, and mental health and substance use issues related to the pandemic. The report will address the long-term effects of COVID-19 on high-risk communities and efforts to address disparities in access to services and supports. The administration is committed to delivering high-quality care for individuals with Long COVID, making services and supports available, and advancing the nation's understanding of the condition through research.
