On October 18, 2017, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, S. 178, is called the "Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act." It establishes requirements for the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute elder abuse crimes. It also expands telemarketing fraud to include "email marketing" fraud.

The second bill, S. 652, is called the "Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2017." It reauthorizes and modifies two programs within the Department of Health and Human Services that focus on early detection, diagnosis, and treatment for deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, and young children.

The third bill, H.R. 1117, requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to submit a report to Congress on plans to improve the administration of disaster assistance during emergency or disaster responses.
