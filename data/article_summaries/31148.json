On November 22, 2019, the President signed into law the "Rebuilding Small Businesses After Disasters Act," which extends the current Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loan collateral requirements for three more years until November 24, 2022. The law also requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit a report to relevant congressional committees within one year of enactment. The report will compare the performance, including default rates, of SBA disaster loans made before and after the current collateral requirements were established.
