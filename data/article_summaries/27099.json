The United Nations-Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) released a report confirming that the Assad regime used the chemical weapon sarin in Khan Shaykhun, Syria on April 4, 2017. Over 100 citizens, including children and women, were killed in this attack. This is the fourth time the JIM has confirmed the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. The United States urges the UN Security Council to renew the mandate of the JIM to hold those responsible accountable and send a message that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated. It is crucial that all countries support the work of the JIM to prevent such use of chemical weapons in the future.
