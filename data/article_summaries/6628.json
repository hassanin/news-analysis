The article mentions the recent Supreme Court decision to effectively end affirmative action, emphasizing the critical role of HSIs in supporting these students. The Biden administration is committed to strengthening these institutions and has invested $11 billion in HSIs through the American Rescue Plan. They have also increased Pell Grants for low-income families and implemented student loan repayment programs to ease the financial burden of college. The article concludes by proclaiming September 10 to September 16, 2023, as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week, calling for the recognition of the contributions of these institutions and their graduates.
