President Biden has taken historic actions to accelerate the development of clean energy technologies in the United States. These actions include authorizing the use of the Defense Production Act (DPA) to expand domestic manufacturing of critical clean energy technologies, such as advanced batteries and offshore wind. The President is also leveraging federal procurement to stimulate the growth of domestic solar manufacturing capacity. Additionally, efforts are being made to strengthen the power grid and support clean energy construction projects.

Since President Biden took office, the private sector has committed over $100 billion in new capital to produce electric vehicles and batteries domestically. Investments have also been made in clean hydrogen, nuclear, and other cutting-edge technologies. The expansion of domestic solar manufacturing capacity is expected to triple by 2024, allowing millions of homes to switch to clean solar energy each year.

The President's actions aim to create good-paying jobs, cut energy costs for families, and address the urgent issue of climate change. The use of the DPA will prioritize strong labor standards and environmental justice outcomes, benefiting low-income communities burdened by legacy pollution.

To further support clean energy development, President Biden is urging Congress to pass tax cuts and additional investments in clean energy manufacturing and deployment. Failing to do so could hinder consumer access to cost-cutting clean energy options and delay critical projects for tackling the climate crisis.

In summary, President Biden is taking bold steps to accelerate clean energy development in the United States, including the use of the DPA, federal procurement measures, and support for grid-strengthening and clean energy construction projects. These actions will create jobs, reduce energy costs, and contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable future.
