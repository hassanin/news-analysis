On May 16, 2009, President Obama announced his nomination of Republican Utah Governor Jon Huntsman to be the Ambassador to China. The President believes that working with China is crucial in addressing global challenges in the 21st century due to its large population and economy. The President sees the need for continued collaboration with China to address the financial crisis and promote sustainable growth. Governor Huntsman is seen as a suitable candidate for this role as he has respect for China's traditions, understands how to make America more competitive, and will advocate for American interests and ideals. He also has extensive foreign policy experience, including serving as the Deputy United States Trade Ambassador and the United States Ambassador to Singapore. Additionally, Governor Huntsman speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese, which is relevant to his role as Ambassador to China.
