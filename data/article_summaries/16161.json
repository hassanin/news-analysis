President Obama is scheduled to travel to Madrid, Spain, where he will participate in meetings with Spanish officials and speak to military personnel in Rota. However, he will return to Washington one day earlier than planned and will no longer travel to Seville. The President has also accepted an invitation from Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings to travel to Dallas early next week. In Dallas, he will continue his work to bring people together to support police officers and communities and discuss policy ideas for addressing racial disparities in the criminal justice system.
