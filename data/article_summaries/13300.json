President Obama has proclaimed October 2016 as National Youth Justice Awareness Month. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of giving all children, regardless of their background, a fair chance at life and equal opportunities to succeed. It highlights the challenges faced by young people in the justice system, particularly those from distressed communities or with disabilities, mental health issues, or substance use disorders. The proclamation notes that while the number of juvenile arrests has decreased, there is still a significant number of youth involved in the criminal justice system, with children of color being overrepresented. It calls for the modernization of the juvenile and criminal justice systems to hold youth accountable without marginalizing them. The proclamation also discusses the need to reform sentencing laws, increase access to rehabilitative services, and provide age-appropriate transition services for youth reentering society. It mentions the negative consequences of practices like solitary confinement and the importance of quality legal representation for young people. The proclamation emphasizes the need to engage young people early on and create supportive learning environments to prevent them from becoming involved in the justice system. It also highlights the importance of investing in high-quality early childhood education and expanding opportunities for youth to reduce reliance on the justice system. The proclamation calls on all Americans to support and participate in activities and programs that promote youth justice awareness during the month of October.
