The Trump administration has taken steps to address the issue of high drug prices in the United States. In 2018, the official government measure of inflation in drug prices dropped for the first time in 46 years. Several drug companies also cut their prices, froze prices, or rolled back price increases. In May, a new requirement was announced that drug companies must include the list prices of their drugs in TV ads. This will allow consumers to know the cost of a drug before consulting their doctor. The Trump administration's plan for reducing drug prices includes tougher negotiation, increased competition, lower list prices, and lower out-of-pocket costs. The administration claims to have made progress in all four areas.
