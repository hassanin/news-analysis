U.S. Attorney General William Barr argues in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal that nationwide injunctions, in which a federal court order against a government policy applies to the entire country, are harmful to the democratic system and undermine the rule of law. Barr points to the litigation over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program as an example of the negative consequences of nationwide injunctions. He suggests that these injunctions go against the intended structure of the federal judiciary and should be re-examined by the judiciary. Barr concludes by emphasizing the need to restore public confidence in institutions by addressing this practice.
