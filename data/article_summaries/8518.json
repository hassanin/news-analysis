The White House recently held a roundtable to discuss the importance of the right to repair. The right to repair is the ability to fix something you own when it breaks, either by yourself or by taking it to an independent repair shop. This initiative aims to give consumers more options for repairing their devices, lowering costs, and increasing competition. The roundtable included federal and state officials, small business owners, and private sector leaders. National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard emphasized the significance of the right to repair to President Biden's efforts on behalf of consumers and small independent repair businesses. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan highlighted the benefits of competition in repair markets, while Janet McCabe, Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, explained how the right to repair helps combat climate change by extending the lifespan of products. Several state officials shared their legislative successes in passing right to repair laws, and businesses such as Apple and Allstate Insurance expressed their support for national right to repair legislation. Since President Biden's Executive Order, actions have been taken at both the federal and state levels to further the right to repair across industries.
