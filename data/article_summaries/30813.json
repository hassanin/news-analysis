President Trump has signed an executive order establishing the One Trillion Trees Interagency Council, furthering the United States' commitment to the World Economic Forum's One Trillion Trees Initiative. The goal of the initiative is to protect and restore one trillion trees by 2030. The executive order promotes healthy and resilient forests through partnerships with various stakeholders, including states, tribes, communities, non-profit organizations, and the private sector. The Council will coordinate the federal government's interactions with the initiative and address potential limitations. Managing and conserving forests is crucial for maintaining a healthy environment and a robust economy, as they provide clean water, wildlife habitat, and support recreational activities. President Trump has taken several actions to enhance conservation efforts and improve the environment, including passing significant legislation for public lands and calling for the planting of one trillion trees globally. The Department of the Interior has already planted over 58 million trees and plans to plant an additional 22 million by the end of 2020. President Trump's leadership has resulted in improved air quality, access to safe drinking water, and the recovery of endangered and threatened species. The executive order demonstrates President Trump's commitment to protecting and regenerating trees.
