President Biden will sign two directives today to advance national initiatives in quantum information science (QIS). These directives demonstrate the administration's commitment to this emerging technology and aim to maintain American leadership while addressing the risks posed by quantum computers to national and economic security.

The first directive is an Executive Order that enhances the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee, the federal government's expert advisory body for QIS. This move ensures that the committee operates under the authority of the White House, providing up-to-date information to drive US policymaking and technological advancements.

The second directive is a National Security Memorandum that outlines the administration's plan to address the cybersecurity risks posed by quantum computers. Research suggests that in the future, quantum computers could break much of the cryptography currently used to secure digital communications. To counter this threat, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will publish new quantum-resistant cryptographic standards. However, transitioning vulnerable IT systems to these standards will require time, resources, and commitment.

Overall, these directives aim to foster advancements in QIS and protect against the potential risks of quantum computing, ensuring that the US maintains its technological edge and harnesses the economic opportunities associated with breakthroughs in this field.
