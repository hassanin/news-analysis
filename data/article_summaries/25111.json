During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders discussed a range of topics. She addressed the recent Black Hawk helicopter crash in Iraq, stating that it does not appear to have been caused by enemy action. Sanders also mentioned President Trump's upcoming trip to New Hampshire to address the opioid crisis and highlighted the administration's commitment to combatting drug addiction. Additionally, Marc Short, the Director of Legislative Affairs, spoke about the historic obstruction faced by the administration in confirming nominees. He stated that Senate Democrats have required an unprecedented number of cloture votes, slowing down the confirmation process. Short highlighted the long delays in confirming qualified nominees for key positions, including Deputy Secretary of Labor and Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The briefing also touched on topics such as potential staff turnovers in the White House, threats of retaliation from the EU regarding tariffs, and the possibility of new sanctions on Iran.
