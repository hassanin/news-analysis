The Obama Administration has designated the first 12 manufacturing communities through the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (IMCP) to spur investment and create jobs. These communities were selected out of more than 70 that applied and have developed strong economic development plans and partnerships across the public and private sectors. The designated communities will receive federal funding and support to strengthen their regional manufacturing and attract private investment. The designated communities include Southwest Alabama, Southern California, Northwest Georgia, the Chicago metro region, South Kansas, Greater Portland region in Maine, Southeastern Michigan, the New York Finger Lakes region, Southwestern Ohio Aerospace Region, the Tennessee Valley, the Washington Puget Sound region, and the Milwaukee 7 Region. These communities have specific plans to enhance their manufacturing sectors, such as focusing on shipbuilding and aerospace manufacturing, infrastructure investment, workforce training, and improving supply chains. The IMCP aims to boost U.S. manufacturing by rewarding companies that create jobs in the country and attracting global manufacturers to local communities.
