On October 5, 2018, President Donald Trump signed into law the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. While the Act reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration's programs and integrates unmanned aircraft systems into the nation's airspace systems, it also raises several constitutional concerns. The President outlined four provisions of the Act that require the appointment of officers in a manner that does not comply with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. These provisions involve the appointment of members of the Concrete Masonry Products Board, the Board of Directors of the United States International Development Finance Corporation, directors of enterprise funds, and inferior officers with responsibility for significant Transportation Security Administration functions. The President stated that his administration will treat these requirements as advisory and non-binding. Additionally, the Act contains other provisions that raise constitutional concerns, such as those related to the President's authority to supervise the executive branch, conduct foreign affairs, and recommend legislative measures to Congress. The President stated that his administration will interpret and implement these provisions in a manner consistent with his constitutional authority.
