President Trump held a press conference in the Oval Office to discuss the recent veto he issued on a resolution passed by Congress to terminate the national emergency declaration he made last month. The President reiterated his stance on the need for border security and emphasized the importance of building a wall along the southern border to combat illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and crime. He also expressed his condolences to the people of New Zealand following the recent terrorist attacks at two mosques. The President was joined by Vice President Pence, members of his Cabinet, and Angel parents, who have lost loved ones to crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.
