National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with a bipartisan group of House members at the White House to discuss the importance of investing in domestic sources of strength. They talked about the need to grow the economy, support the middle class, and compete with China and other countries. Sullivan also discussed the success of President Biden's recent trip to Europe in rallying democracies around shared goals. He emphasized the importance of linking foreign policy objectives with making investments to grow the economy, including passing bipartisan legislation like the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act and the National Science Foundation for the Future Act. These bills aim to bolster research and development in areas such as climate technology and strengthen advanced manufacturing, supply chain resiliency, and the American semiconductor industry.
