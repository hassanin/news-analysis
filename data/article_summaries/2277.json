The United States House of Representatives has passed the Build Back Better Act, which aims to create jobs, reduce costs, and make the country more competitive. The Act is fully paid for by ensuring that the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations pay their fair share in federal taxes. It also keeps the commitment that those earning less than $400,000 a year will not pay more in federal taxes. Leading economists and independent experts have confirmed that the Act will not contribute to inflationary pressures, but instead boost the economy and reduce costs for families. The Act focuses on rebuilding the economy by supporting working people and the middle class. It now moves to the United States Senate for further consideration.
