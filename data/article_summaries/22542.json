During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest addressed several topics including President Obama's conversation with President-elect Trump, the potential prosecution of Hillary Clinton, the selection of Nigel Farage as the UK Ambassador to the US, immigration policies, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), cybersecurity, and the awarding of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Earnest also discussed the possibility of Vice President Joe Biden having a role after his presidency, the recent bus accident in Tennessee, and the future of the Democratic Party. He did not comment on the potential dismantling of the Iran nuclear deal, the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage, or Governor Pat McCrory's refusal to concede the North Carolina gubernatorial race. Earnest concluded the briefing by discussing President Obama's post-presidency plans and his desire to uphold American values.
