The White House has released the final version of the Financial Aid Shopping Sheet, which is an individualized standard financial aid letter that will help students understand their costs before deciding on where to enroll. The Shopping Sheet allows students to easily compare aid packages offered by different institutions. The U.S. Department of Education partnered with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to develop the Shopping Sheet. The goal is to provide clear information about the costs and responsibilities of student loans upfront, including total estimated annual costs, completion and default rates, and potential monthly loan payments after graduation. Secretary Duncan has asked college and university presidents to adopt the Shopping Sheet as part of their financial aid awards starting in the 2013-14 school year. Institutions interested in adopting the Shopping Sheet can contact the Department of Education for more information. The aim is to help students and families make more informed decisions about where to attend college and understand the debt burdens they may face after graduation.
