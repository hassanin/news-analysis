President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation to modify the boundaries of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah. The proclamation reduces the size of the monument and establishes three separate units: Grand Staircase, Kaiparowits, and Escalante Canyons. The decision to modify the monument was made based on the belief that the current boundaries are larger than necessary for the proper care and management of the objects of historic and scientific interest within the monument. The proclamation also notes that many of the objects identified within the monument are already protected by existing federal laws. The modified boundaries aim to preserve the cultural, scientific, and historic legacy of the area.
