He emphasizes the importance of working together as a nation to address challenges and solve problems, such as the opioid epidemic, mental health crisis, support for veterans, and ending cancer. The President also highlights the need to fight against division and remove obstacles that limit Americans' potential, including combating hate and racism, addressing hunger, and respecting the character and dignity of the American people. He reaffirms America's founding idea that all individuals are created equal and deserve equal treatment throughout their lives. The proclamation calls on Americans to honor and express the best attributes of their character, extend fellowship to their neighbors, and unite in service to their communities.
