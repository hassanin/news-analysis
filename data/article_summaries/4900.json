The American Rescue Plan Implementation Team and the Domestic Policy Council have released an interim report on the American Rescue Plan's equity efforts. The report covers 32 different programs representing nearly $900 billion or 60 percent of the funds allocated by the plan. The report concludes that the American Rescue Plan has led to the most equitable economic recovery in memory. It highlights several areas of success, including the lowest black and Hispanic child poverty rates ever in 2021, support for small businesses, equitable housing recovery, investment in education, reducing health disparities, addressing hunger, and revitalizing local economies. The plan has also made a historic investment in tribal communities. The report acknowledges the lessons learned and areas for continued work and collaboration with external partners.
