During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, the First Lady and President Trump are encouraging women to learn about the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer. They emphasize the importance of early detection and proper treatment in fighting the disease. The administration is also working to improve the quality and cost of care for ovarian cancer patients. Over 20,000 American women are expected to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, and 14,000 will die from it. The President has taken steps to eliminate regulations and promote the development of new drugs for cancer treatment. He has also signed Right to Try legislation, which allows patients to access potentially lifesaving drugs. The administration aims to provide Americans with the choice and freedom to make decisions about their health and ensure access to the doctors, treatments, and medical care they need. The President calls for advancing research capabilities, improving the quality of care, and ultimately eradicating ovarian cancer and all forms of the disease. The First Lady and President Trump express their support for those battling cancer and remember the women who have lost their lives to the disease. They are committed to finding a cure for ovarian cancer so that future generations of women can live healthy, happy, and cancer-free lives.
