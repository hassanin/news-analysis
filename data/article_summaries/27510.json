Secretary Shulkin announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will adopt the same electronic health record (EHR) system as the Department of Defense (DOD), in order to create a seamless transfer of information between the two departments. The VA will be adopting the MHS GENESIS system, which is the same system used by the DOD. This decision is aimed at improving the healthcare for veterans and active servicemembers, as well as maximizing interoperability with community providers. The decision was made to move away from the VA's internal system and adopt an off-the-shelf commercial product, as the VA does not see a compelling reason to be in the software development business. The implementation of the new EHR system is expected to take about three to six months. The cost negotiations for the new system have not yet begun, but the VA expects it to be more cost-effective than maintaining their current systems. The decision to adopt the same EHR system as the DOD is part of the Trump administration's commitment to act quickly and make necessary changes to improve veterans' healthcare.
