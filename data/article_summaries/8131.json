House Republicans are being criticized for introducing a continuing resolution that includes an 8% across-the-board cut to programs that many Americans rely on. This move violates the bipartisan budget deal made earlier this year. Additionally, the resolution makes even deeper cuts to key programs, including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps families heat their homes during the winter. The proposed cut to LIHEAP is over 60%, which would have significant impacts across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
