The United States has submitted its target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The target, referred to as an Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), is to reduce emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025, with a best effort to reduce by 28%. This target will double the pace of carbon pollution reduction in the US from 1.2% per year to 2.3-2.8% per year between 2020 and 2025. The target is grounded in cost-effective carbon pollution reductions achievable under existing law and is a step towards achieving deep economy-wide reductions of 80% or more by 2050. The US government has taken strong actions to cut carbon pollution, including investing in clean energy technologies, implementing fuel efficiency and appliance energy efficiency standards, and promoting renewable energy and efficiency. The government has also proposed guidelines for existing power plants to reduce emissions, set standards for heavy-duty engines and vehicles, implemented energy efficiency standards, and taken measures to reduce methane emissions.
