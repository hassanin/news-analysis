The article discusses the progress made by the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL in the fight against the terrorist group. The coalition, led by the United States, has intensified efforts to liberate ISIL-controlled territory in Iraq and Syria and has seen significant progress in degrading and destroying the group. ISIL has lost approximately 40% of the territory it once controlled in Iraq and more than 10% in Syria. Military efforts, including airstrikes and training of local forces, have been ramped up, resulting in the death of senior ISIL leaders and the retaking of key cities. The coalition has also made progress in cutting off ISIL's access to energy resources. In addition to military efforts, political, stabilization, and humanitarian efforts are being made to support Iraq and Syria. The United States continues to lead diplomatic efforts to reach a political transition in Syria and provides significant humanitarian aid to both Iraq and Syria. Efforts to counter ISIL's propaganda and financial networks are also underway. Domestically, the United States has strengthened its efforts to prevent radicalization and mobilization of recruits. Moving forward, the coalition aims to drive out ISIL from the remaining stretch of the Turkish-Syrian border, stabilize key areas, and increase the number of Iraqi Sunnis in the fight against ISIL.
