Former White House Press Secretary James Brady has passed away. President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama extend their condolences to Brady's family. Brady is remembered for his professionalism and warmth as press secretary for President Reagan, as well as his strength in recovering from the shooting that almost took his life 33 years ago. He turned this tragedy into a legacy of service by founding the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The law named after him, implemented in 1993, has prevented dangerous individuals from obtaining guns. Brady's impact is evident in the lives that have been saved as a result. The White House Briefing Room was renamed the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room in 2000, and a plaque serves as a reminder of his courage and dedication. The President and First Lady's thoughts and prayers are with Brady's wife Sarah, their children Scott and Melissa, and all those who were inspired by him.
