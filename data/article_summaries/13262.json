President Obama expresses his disappointment with Senate Republicans for blocking a public debate on Wall Street reform. He believes that some senators may view this obstruction as a political strategy, while others may see it as an opportunity to weaken or eliminate reform behind closed doors with the influence of financial industry lobbyists. The President emphasizes that the American people cannot afford to have inadequate consumer protections and accountability on Wall Street, as it was a major factor in the economic downturn that caused job loss and homelessness for millions of Americans. He calls for the Senate to prioritize the country's interests over party affiliation and resume working on the reform that both parties have been collaborating on for a year, in order to prevent a similar crisis from occurring in the future.
