The White House has released a fact sheet outlining President Obama's plan to make child care more affordable and accessible for working families. The fact sheet highlights the importance of high-quality child care and early education in promoting a child's development and supporting parents in balancing work and family responsibilities. It states that child care costs have become a significant burden on parents, with a year of child care costing more than a year of in-state tuition at most colleges. The fact sheet proposes several measures to address this issue, including increasing investment in the Child Care and Development Fund, tripling the maximum child care tax credit, and creating an innovation fund to better serve families facing unique challenges in finding quality care. The fact sheet also emphasizes the economic benefits of investing in early childhood programs, citing research that shows a high return on investment. It mentions the Obama administration's previous efforts to expand access to high-quality preschool and early education, as well as its other initiatives to support working families.
