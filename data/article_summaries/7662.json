The President's FY 2024 Budget focuses on investing in America, reducing costs for families, protecting Social Security and Medicare, and reducing the deficit. One of the main goals of the budget is to extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by at least 25 years. This would ensure that Medicare is available for Americans when they turn 65. The budget achieves this without making any benefit cuts and even lowers costs for Medicare beneficiaries. The proposals in the budget are estimated to extend the solvency of Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund into the 2050s, compared to the previous projection of insolvency in 2028. Overall, the President's Budget aims to strengthen Medicare while reducing costs for beneficiaries.
