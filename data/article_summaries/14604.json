The United States is committed to supporting Ukraine in its efforts to establish security, restore economic stability, strengthen the rule of law, fight against corruption, and carry out democratic and constitutional reforms. The White House has announced that it will commit $20 million to support comprehensive reform in the Ukrainian law enforcement and justice sectors, including anti-corruption reforms. Additionally, $3 million will be directed to the UN World Food Program to provide food rations and assistance to people affected by the conflict in eastern Ukraine. In total, the US government has committed nearly $320 million in assistance to Ukraine this year, in addition to a $1 billion sovereign loan guarantee issued in May 2014. The US is also working with Congress to identify additional opportunities for assistance, including requesting an additional $45 million to help build Ukraine's defense capabilities. The assistance provided by the US includes economic stabilization, reform, and growth; security sector capacity building and reform; support for national unity, democracy, human rights, and media; anti-corruption initiatives; energy security; humanitarian assistance and early recovery; and trade diversification and promotion.
