President Barack Obama congratulates the House on passing the bipartisan Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. He believes this legislation will bring about a new era of service in America. The act aims to provide new opportunities for millions of Americans to serve their country, including improving service learning in schools and creating a corps of 250,000 members dedicated to addressing national problems. It also encourages working Americans, retirees, and baby boomers to engage in part-time service opportunities. The legislation aims to tap into the potential of faith-based and community organizations and find innovative ideas to address common challenges. President Obama calls on all Americans to seize these opportunities and serve their communities, shaping history and enriching lives across the country.
