President Obama has declared a major disaster in New Jersey and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following a severe storm on October 29, 2011. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding. William L. Vogel has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk at (202) 646-3272 or FEMA-NEWS-DESK@DHS.GOV.
