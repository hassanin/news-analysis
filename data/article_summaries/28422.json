President Trump has taken action to address the worsening situation in Mali, where terrorist activities have expanded and made it the most dangerous UN Peacekeeping mission in the world. Despite the 2015 Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation, little progress has been made in resolving the conflict. With this action, the Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State, now has the authority to sanction individuals responsible for exacerbating the situation in Mali. This includes those who threaten peace, undermine democratic processes, or obstruct the implementation of the 2015 agreement. The goal is to promote resolution of the conflict and hold accountable those who have committed acts of violence or engaged in other crimes that have caused suffering for the people of Mali.
