President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency due to the situation in and in relation to Syria, specifically the recent actions by the Government of Turkey to conduct a military offensive into northeast Syria. The President believes that these actions undermine the campaign to defeat ISIS, endanger civilians, and threaten peace, security, and stability in the region. As a result, the order blocks all property and interests in property within the jurisdiction of the United States of certain persons determined to be responsible for or complicit in actions that contribute to this threat. The order also authorizes the Secretary of State to impose sanctions on individuals involved in obstructing a ceasefire or political solution in Syria. Additionally, the order suspends the entry of such persons into the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to carry out the purposes of this order.
