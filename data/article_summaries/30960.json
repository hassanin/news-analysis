In a press briefing, Marc Short, the Director of Legislative Affairs, gave an update on the progress of the President's agenda through Congress. He criticized Senate Democrats for obstructing the confirmation of the President's nominees to various government positions, leaving key national security, energy, financial, and regulatory positions unfilled. Short called on Senator Chuck Schumer to stop blocking the nominations and for the media to shed light on the issue. He also discussed the slow progress on healthcare reform and expressed confidence that the bill will pass before the August recess. The briefing also touched on the President's recent trip to Poland and Germany, the liberation of Mosul from ISIS, and the June jobs report. The briefing ended with questions about the meeting between President Trump and Russian President Putin at the G20 Summit, the recent meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, and the President's position on the Paris climate accord.
