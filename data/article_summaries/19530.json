The White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, gave a briefing to the travel pool in Prague, Czech Republic regarding the North Korean missile launch. He stated that the President was informed of the launch shortly after it happened and has been in contact with General Cartwright, Vice Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of Defense Bob Gates. Secretary of State Clinton and Ambassador Rice have also begun reaching out to their counterparts. The President has been involved in meetings about the situation for the past few weeks and if the launch posed a threat to the US, steps would have been taken to ensure the safety of the American people. The President has not yet spoken directly to allies such as Japan or South Korea. The missile launch does not overshadow the President's speech, but rather emphasizes the urgency of his agenda and policies regarding the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The President's speech still includes a message of a world without nuclear weapons, but the actions of North Korea further isolate them from the international community. The text of the speech has been altered to reflect the current situation. Updates will be provided as assessments are made and foreign leaders the President has spoken to will also be updated. The timing of the first UN resolution on the matter is still unknown.
