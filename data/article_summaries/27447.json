On September 25, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation regarding immigration and Venezuela. The proclamation states that there is a political and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela due to the failure of Nicolas Maduro and his regime officials to support the rule of law. In order to support the functioning of constitutional government and democratic institutions in Venezuela, President Trump has determined that it is in the interest of the United States to restrict and suspend the entry of senior members of the Maduro regime and others who undermine Venezuela's democratic institutions or impede the restoration of constitutional government. The suspension applies to both immigrants and nonimmigrants. However, the suspension does not apply to those who cease these actions and take concrete steps to help return Venezuela to a functioning, democratic country. The proclamation delegates authority to the Secretary of State to identify the individuals covered by the suspension. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security will establish procedures for implementing the proclamation. The proclamation also includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents, individuals granted asylum, refugees, and those whose entry would further important U.S. law enforcement objectives. The proclamation will remain in effect until the Secretary of State determines that it is no longer necessary.
