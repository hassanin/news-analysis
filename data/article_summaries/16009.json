The White House has issued a letter stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared in 1995, will continue beyond March 15, 2015. Despite the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) between the P5+1 countries and Iran, which has temporarily relieved sanctions on Iran in exchange for actions to halt and roll back its nuclear program, the US government believes that certain actions and policies of the Iranian government still pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, comprehensive sanctions against Iran will be maintained.
