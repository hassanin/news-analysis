The National Security Council expresses deep concern over the arrest of Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong businessman, publisher, and pro-democracy advocate, along with his sons and several executives from his media company. These arrests were made under the national security law imposed by the Chinese Communist Party, which denies the people of Hong Kong their fundamental rights and liberties. The arrests, along with recent actions by the Hong Kong government to disqualify candidates and postpone elections, are seen as violations of Beijing's commitments to Hong Kong and an attempt to intimidate pro-democracy figures and suppress independent media. The National Security Council stands with Jimmy Lai and calls on Beijing to repeal the national security law and restore Hong Kong's rule of law.
