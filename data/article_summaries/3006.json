The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, Xavier Becerra, along with Gender Policy Council Director Jen Klein and Deputy Assistant to the President for Economic Mobility, Carmel Martin, hosted a discussion at the White House with parents and their children to address the issue of high child care costs and the need for more high-quality child care options. They highlighted President Biden's plans to make a significant investment in child care and preschool, which would save working families more than half of their child care expenses and increase the number of high-quality child care providers. The plan also includes two years of free preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, allowing parents to choose between public schools, child care providers, and Head Start. The officials emphasized the importance of early learning experiences in a child's future success, citing research that shows a high return on investment in early childhood care and education. The parents in attendance shared their struggles with the high costs and limited availability of quality child care, particularly during the pandemic. They expressed how the President's plans would help them access affordable and high-quality child care and early education.
