The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Office of Public Engagement recently held the "Communities in Action: Building a Better Georgia" event, hosting over 40 elected officials and community leaders from Georgia. First Lady Jill Biden made an appearance at the half-day forum, which also featured senior Biden-Harris Administration officials such as Xavier Becerra, Michael Reagan, Susan Rice, Keisha Lance Bottoms, Mitch Landrieu, Gene Sperling, and Gabe Amo. The event focused on discussing the benefits and impact of President Biden's American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act for working families in Georgia. The White House officials emphasized the strong partnership between the administration and Georgia state and local government officials, labor leaders, businesses, non-profits, and business leaders, and the potential to leverage these investments to create more opportunities for working families. This event is part of a series of "Communities in Action" events held by the White House to showcase the administration's achievements for the American people.
