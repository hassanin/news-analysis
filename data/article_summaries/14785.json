The White House has announced that President Obama has authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 additional U.S. military personnel to Iraq in a non-combat role. These troops will be tasked with training, advising, and assisting Iraqi Security Forces, including Kurdish forces, as they continue to fight against ISIL. The decision was made at the request of the Iraqi government and upon the recommendation of Secretary Hagel and military commanders. The mission will be coordinated with multiple coalition partners and funded through an Iraq Train and Equip fund. The U.S. and its allies have already seen success in recent weeks with defeats against ISIL, and they will continue to confront the threat with strength and resolve.
