The article is a statement by the President on the Senate's passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) of 2013. The President commends the bipartisan majority in the Senate for taking an important step towards ending discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals in the workplace. The President emphasizes that no one should be denied a job or fired based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, just as no one should be discriminated against based on race, gender, religion, or disability. The President acknowledges the efforts of those who have fought for this progress over the years and urges the House of Representatives to pass the bill as well. The President highlights the overwhelming support for the bill from the American people, including Republican voters, corporations, small businesses, and faith communities. The President concludes by urging the House Republican leadership to bring the bill to a vote and send it to his desk for signing into law, as it would be a historic step towards fulfilling the ideals that define the nation.
