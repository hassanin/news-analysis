The second Global COVID-19 Summit is set to take place virtually on May 12, 2022, with the United States as the chair. Other co-hosts include Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal, representing various international organizations and regional bodies. The summit aims to build on the efforts made during the first COVID Summit and will focus on four key objectives: getting shots in arms, expanding access to tests and treatments, advancing health security, and preventing future catastrophes. The U.S. has already committed to sharing 1.2 billion doses of vaccines with the world, having sent over 530 million doses to 115 countries. The summit will feature remarks from President Biden and other heads of state, as well as three sessions dedicated to the aforementioned objectives. The U.S. government has called on governments, civil society, businesses, and philanthropies to make significant new commitments. The summit represents the U.S.'s leadership in the global COVID-19 response and its efforts to engage with the world to end the pandemic's acute phase and prepare for future threats. The U.S. and co-host nations are optimistic about another successful summit that will accelerate the international response to combat COVID-19 and advance global pandemic preparedness.
