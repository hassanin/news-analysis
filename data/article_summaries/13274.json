President Obama has unveiled a new initiative called "United We Serve," which calls on all Americans to engage in meaningful volunteer service in their daily lives. The initiative, led by the Corporation for National and Community Service, encourages Americans to visit the website www.serve.gov to find and create service projects in their communities. The summer initiative begins on June 22nd and runs through September 11th, the National Day of Service and Remembrance. The President's call focuses on four key areas: education, health, energy and the environment, and community renewal. The goal of United We Serve is to make volunteerism and community service a part of every American's daily life.
