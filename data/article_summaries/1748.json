President Biden announced more than $10 billion in new investment in American manufacturing during a visit to Grand Hyatt Seoul in South Korea. The investment includes $5 billion for advanced automotive technology and a $5.5 billion investment to open a new factory near Savannah, Georgia, which is expected to create over 8,000 new jobs. The plan is to begin construction in January 2023, with the facility producing electric vehicles and batteries by 2025. President Biden commended Senators Rafael Warnock and Jon Ossoff for their efforts in making Georgia a magnet for clean energy investment. The administration aims to have 50% of all new vehicles sold by 2030 be electric. The president highlighted the benefits of electric vehicles for climate goals, job creation, and economic growth. He also mentioned the importance of investing in charging stations and battery technology. President Biden expressed readiness to respond to any actions by North Korea but stated that he was not concerned and had no specific message for Kim Jong Un during his visit.
