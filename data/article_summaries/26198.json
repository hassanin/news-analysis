On August 1, 2018, the President signed two laws into effect. The first law, known as the "Knowledgeable Innovators and Worthy Investors Act" or the KIWI Act, allows New Zealand nationals to enter the United States as nonimmigrant traders and investors. However, this eligibility is contingent on New Zealand providing reciprocal treatment to U.S. nationals. The second law, S. 2850, makes amendments to the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010. These amendments expand the uses of the WMAT Settlement Fund. Additionally, the Long-Term Leasing Act of 1955 is amended to authorize 99-year leases for all lands within the boundaries of the Santa Clara and Ohkay Owingeh Pueblos.
