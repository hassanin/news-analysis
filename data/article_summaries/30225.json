On November 22, 2015, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to address the threat to national security and foreign policy posed by the situation in Burundi. This situation was characterized by violence against civilians, unrest, incitement of imminent violence, political repression, and a threat to the peace, security, and stability of Burundi and the region. The national emergency, which was initially declared in 2015, is being extended for another year, beyond November 22, 2019. This extension is deemed necessary due to the ongoing threat that Burundi poses to the United States. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
