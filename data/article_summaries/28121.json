The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has released a report on how the government can reduce the prices of lifesaving drugs while stimulating innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. The report acknowledges that the affordability of healthcare and biopharmaceutical drugs is a major concern for Americans. It argues that promoting innovation and affordable drugs are not conflicting goals, as new innovations often provide improved health that was previously unavailable at any price. The report suggests that government policies should aim to reduce domestic drug prices paid by Americans and also lower the price of better health in the future by spurring medical innovation. It discusses changes to Medicare and Medicaid programs that could help lower domestic prices, as well as reforms to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to encourage more robust price competition. The report also highlights the need to preserve incentives for biopharmaceutical innovation while promoting lower prices for Americans. It notes that most foreign governments force drug manufacturers to comply with pricing rules, resulting in lower drug prices than those in the United States. The report argues that pharmaceutical innovators and foreign governments rely on American patients and taxpayers to finance research and development. The government's objective in biopharmaceutical policy is to ensure that the private sector competes and invests in meaningful innovations that lower the price of health, rather than incentivizing market exclusivity and high prices on products. The report suggests a combined strategy of correcting government policies that hinder price competition domestically and limiting free-riding abroad to achieve the goals of reducing American prices and stimulating innovation.
