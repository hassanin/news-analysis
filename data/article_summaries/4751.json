The memorandum is addressed to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce and discusses the conservation of the natural and cultural heritage of the Pacific Remote Islands. The memorandum highlights the diverse marine life in the area, including sharks, rays, tuna, and whales, as well as the historical significance of the islands to Pacific Island Indigenous Peoples. It mentions previous efforts to protect the waters around these islands through the establishment of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. However, certain areas remain unprotected, including ecologically significant habitats and seamounts.

It also emphasizes collaboration with Indigenous Peoples and the development of naming conventions that reflect ancestral, historical, and cultural connections. Additionally, the memorandum calls for recommendations on honoring the heritage and traditional practices of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island Indigenous communities.
