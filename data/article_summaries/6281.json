The Biden-Harris administration is focused on rebuilding the immigration system after four years of chaos and mismanagement. In May, there was a reduction in border apprehensions compared to the peak in 2019. However, border numbers can fluctuate based on annual migration trends. The administration aims to establish lawful pathways for migration and address the root causes of migration. They also want to restore fair, orderly, and humane means to apply for asylum and deter irregular migration. The administration has made progress in managing the border effectively and securely while treating people fairly and humanely. This approach is supported by the American people.
