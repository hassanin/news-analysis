President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations, which was declared in Executive Order 13581 on July 24, 2011, and further expanded in Executive Order 13863 on March 15, 2019, is to continue beyond July 24, 2023. The President believes that these criminal organizations have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States, posing a threat to international political and economic systems. These organizations are deeply involved in foreign governments and the international financial system, which weakens democratic institutions, erodes the rule of law, and undermines economic markets. Additionally, they contribute to violent conflicts and enable the activities of other dangerous individuals. President Biden has determined that significant transnational criminal organizations still present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, thus necessitating the continuation of the national emergency.
