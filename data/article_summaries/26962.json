President Donald J. Trump is implementing measures to protect national security and ensure the safety of American citizens. These actions build upon Executive Order 13780, which was signed in March. The Trump Administration has collaborated with foreign governments to establish minimum security requirements for immigration. The majority of Americans support the President's efforts to enhance vetting procedures. Congress, the Obama Administration, and the courts have all recognized the need for increased security and vetting. Trump Administration officials emphasize the importance of the travel Executive Order for the nation's safety and security. Customs and consular officers face challenges in processing millions of visitors each year, putting a strain on Homeland Security and State Department officers and caseworkers.
