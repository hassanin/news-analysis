President Biden will appoint FEMA Region 9 Administrator Bob Fenton as the "Chief Federal Response Coordinator" for Maui in order to oversee the federal recovery efforts in the wake of the devastating wildfires. Over 1,000 federal personnel are currently on the ground in Maui to assist with response efforts. President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will be visiting Maui to meet with emergency responders, survivors, and local officials. The President has directed Fenton to ensure that all federal resources are provided to help the community rebuild as quickly as possible. The Biden-Harris Administration has launched a whole-of-government effort to support residents and affected communities, and they encourage impacted individuals to register for federal assistance. The U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration has also announced the immediate availability of $3 million in emergency relief funds for traffic management services and infrastructure repairs. A joint Disaster Recovery Center has been opened in Maui to provide support and access to resources.
