On November 23, 2021, the President signed two bills into law. The first is H.R. 1510, which requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to report to Congress on the use of cameras in VA medical facilities. The second is S. 108, which authorizes the Seminole Tribe of Florida to convey interests in certain off-reservation land owned by the Tribe. The President expressed gratitude to Representatives McKinley, Trone, Mooney, Miller, Reschenthaler, and Bost, as well as Senators Capito, Manchin, Boozman, Braun, and Sinema for their leadership in these matters. Additionally, Senators Rubio and Rick Scott and Representative Soto were thanked for their leadership on S. 108.
