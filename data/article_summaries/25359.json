President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation to adjust imports of steel articles into the United States. The Secretary of Commerce had previously found that steel imports were threatening the national security of the country. In March 2018, a 25 percent ad valorem tariff was imposed on steel articles imported from most countries. However, the Secretary has now advised the President that the domestic industry's capacity utilization has improved to the recommended level, which will benefit the financial viability of the industry in the long term. As a result, the President has decided to exclude Canada and Mexico from the tariff, as alternative measures have been agreed upon with these countries to address the national security concerns. The President may revisit this determination in the future. The current tariff level will be maintained for other countries. The proclamation includes the specific modifications and effective dates for the tariff adjustments. Any steel articles imported from Canada and Mexico before May 20, 2019, will not be subject to the additional tariff.
