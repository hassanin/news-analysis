In this statement, President Obama discusses the progress made in Afghanistan and outlines the plan for the withdrawal of American troops. He emphasizes that the United States did not seek the fight in Afghanistan but went in out of necessity after the 9/11 attacks. He highlights the accomplishments in the fight against al Qaeda, including the elimination of Osama bin Laden and the prevention of Afghanistan being used as a launchpad for attacks on the United States. President Obama states that the combat mission in Afghanistan will end by the end of the year, and American personnel will transition to an advisory role. He also mentions that the United States is open to cooperating with Afghanistan on training Afghan forces and supporting counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda. President Obama outlines the planned troop presence in Afghanistan, with a reduction by the end of 2015 and a complete drawdown to a normal embassy presence by the end of 2016. He emphasizes that the international community will continue to support Afghanistan through financial and development assistance. However, the military presence after 2014 is contingent on the Afghan government signing the Bilateral Security Agreement. President Obama concludes by stating that it is time to turn the page on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and redirect resources to address changing global threats and priorities. He reaffirms the commitment to a sovereign, secure, stable, and unified Afghanistan and expresses the intention to support Afghan-led efforts for reconciliation and peace. The President also acknowledges the sacrifices made by the military and commits to providing care and benefits to veterans. He plans to discuss the broader strategy going forward in Afghanistan with the newest class of military officers at West Point.
