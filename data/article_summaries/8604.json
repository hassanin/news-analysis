The United States is pledging further support to Ukraine in its defense against Russia's ongoing aggression. This support includes additional artillery munitions, radars, and other equipment. The United States has already provided a significant amount of security assistance to Ukraine, delivering authorized weapons and equipment directly to the front lines. This assistance, along with contributions from allies and partners, has been crucial in helping Ukraine successfully defend itself and hinder Putin's war aims. However, the United States is nearing the end of available funding for security assistance through drawdown authorities. To ensure Ukraine's success in the next phase of the war, international partners, including the U.S., must continue to demonstrate unity and commitment in providing uninterrupted support. Congress is urged to quickly approve the requested funding to strengthen Ukraine both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.
