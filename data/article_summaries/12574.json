President Obama and several members of his cabinet will be visiting New Orleans to assess progress on Gulf Coast rebuilding and recovery. This trip will include a town hall event where the President will hear directly from the people of Louisiana. The administration has been working to provide residents of the Gulf Coast with the tools they need to recover, including cutting through bureaucratic red tape and improving coordination among federal agencies and local partners. Over $1 billion in public assistance projects have been obligated since the start of the administration, and efforts have been made to improve disaster preparedness and response nationwide.
