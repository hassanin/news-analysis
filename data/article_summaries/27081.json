President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of California due to wildfires and high winds that have been ongoing since July 23, 2018. This declaration allows for Federal funding to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts. Affected individuals in Shasta County can receive assistance in the form of grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the wildfires and high winds. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for cost-sharing funding. William Roche has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are still ongoing in other areas, and additional counties may receive assistance once assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free phone numbers operate from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. seven days a week until further notice. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
