In this article, the President of the United States declares a continuation of the national emergency regarding weapons of mass destruction. The emergency was initially declared in 1994 and has been extended each subsequent year. The President states that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery still pose a significant threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. As a result, the national emergency declared in 1994, as amended by subsequent executive orders, will continue for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
