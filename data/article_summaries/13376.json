The White House will be hosting a Summit on Countering Violent Extremism on February 18, 2015. The summit aims to highlight efforts, both domestic and international, to prevent individuals or groups from being radicalized and committing acts of violence. The strategy released in 2011, titled "Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States," will serve as a foundation for the summit. The cities of Boston, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis-St. Paul have taken the lead in building pilot frameworks that integrate various social service providers, law enforcement agencies, and community leaders to address violent extremism. The summit will showcase best practices and emerging efforts from these communities. Additionally, representatives from partner nations will be present, focusing on community engagement, religious leader engagement, and the role of the private sector and tech community. The summit will involve presentations, panel discussions, and small group interactions to better understand, identify, and prevent the cycle of radicalization to violence. More information about participants and the agenda will be provided in the future.
