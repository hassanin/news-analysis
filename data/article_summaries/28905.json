In a speech delivered in Colombia, Vice President Mike Pence expressed the United States' support for interim President Juan Guaidó and the people of Venezuela in their struggle for freedom and democracy. Pence condemned the actions of the Maduro regime, including blocking aid from reaching the Venezuelan people and using violence against peaceful protesters. He called on all nations to recognize Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela and to take actions to isolate the Maduro dictatorship, including freezing assets and imposing sanctions. Pence also announced that the United States would provide an additional $56 million in aid to support countries in the region that are assisting Venezuelan refugees. He urged members of the Venezuelan armed forces to accept President Guaidó's offer of amnesty and join the fight for democracy. Pence concluded his speech by expressing his belief that freedom will prevail in Venezuela and that the long nightmare of the Maduro regime will soon come to an end.
