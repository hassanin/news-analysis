The Obama Administration has announced new efforts to increase national preparedness by building community capacity to recover from disasters. The President believes that our ability to respond to and recover from disasters is dependent on building resilience in our communities. The impacts of climate change pose significant challenges for communities that are not prepared to adapt to extreme conditions. The Federal government is taking action to address vulnerabilities and improve national preparedness. These actions include providing training funds for economic recovery and resilience initiatives, creating a platform for businesses to be recognized for building community resilience, releasing a toolkit focused on the needs of homeless populations during disasters, establishing a "Built Environment" resilience gateway in the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit, enhancing situational awareness of energy system status, establishing a national network of critical infrastructure security and resilience resources, launching a community recovery resource portal, and providing training opportunities to aid cultural institutions in disaster preparedness.
