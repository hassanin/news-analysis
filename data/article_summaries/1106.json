The Biden Administration is organizing a shipment of approximately 6.2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Reckitt Mead Johnson Enfamil Stage 1 infant formula base powder. The formula will be transported from Singapore to Chicago via flights on July 12, 14, and 19. The delivery includes over 418,000 pounds of infant formula base powder, which will be converted into final products at a facility in Wanamingo, MN. The formula will then be made available at national and regional retailers. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed for the export of additional infant formula into the U.S., and Reckitt Mead Johnson plans to bring approximately 66 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Enfamil Stage 1 infant formula base powder into the U.S. market by mid-July. This initiative, called Operation Fly Formula, aims to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure it reaches store shelves quickly. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) are working together to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards. By July 3, Operation Fly Formula will have transported more than 37.2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S. The Biden Administration has also invoked the Defense Production Act and taken other measures to ensure an adequate supply of safe infant formula for families.
