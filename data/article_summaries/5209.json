The new White House Initiative on Women's Health Research, led by First Lady Jill Biden and the White House Gender Policy Council, aims to address the lack of investment and underrepresentation of women in health research. This initiative seeks to close research gaps and improve women's health by providing tools and information for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of conditions that predominantly affect women or affect women differently. President Biden believes in the power of research to save lives and provide quality healthcare, and this initiative will drive innovation and close research gaps. Dr. Carolyn Mazure, an expert in women's health research, will chair the initiative and coordinate efforts on behalf of the Office of the First Lady and the Gender Policy Council. The initiative will mobilize the federal government, private sector, and philanthropic sectors to invest in women's health research and spur innovation. The goal is to improve the lives of millions of women by uncovering answers and finding bold solutions to common women's health conditions.
