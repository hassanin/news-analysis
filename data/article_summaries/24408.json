During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest addressed a variety of topics including immigration reform, the Baltimore protests, the situation in Yemen, Iran, and trade agreements. Earnest explained that President Obama is determined to use executive authority to bring some accountability to the broken immigration system, and that expanding beyond that would be something for future Presidents and courts to decide. He also stated that it is the Attorney General's decision on whether to open an investigation into a pattern of discrimination in the Baltimore police department. Earnest discussed the situation in Yemen, expressing concern about the impact on the civilian population and emphasizing the need for a political resolution to the conflict. He also mentioned that the President has been engaged in making the case to Democrats and Republicans about the benefits of trade agreements, particularly the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Earnest addressed questions about surveillance in Baltimore, stating that he would refer to law enforcement officials for details on the specific situation. He also mentioned that the President is continuing to push for the closure of Guantanamo Bay, but has been disappointed by the lack of cooperation from Congress. Finally, Earnest stated that the President is monitoring the British elections, but did not offer any further comments.
