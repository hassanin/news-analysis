The White House has designated two Iranian government officials responsible for serious human rights abuses against the people of Iran. Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, Tehran Prosecutor General, and Mohammed Reza Naqdi, commander of the Basij Forces, have been added to a list of officials designated in 2010 for human rights abuses. These individuals will face financial sanctions and visa ineligibilities under U.S. law. The United States emphasizes the importance of protecting human rights and supports the Iranian people in their struggle for freedom of expression and the respect of their rights. The U.S. will continue to hold accountable those who infringe upon these universal rights.
