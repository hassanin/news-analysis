The article discusses how poverty in America has significantly declined over the past 50 years, but neither side of the political spectrum recognizes the progress that has been made. The authors argue that instead of focusing on reported incomes, poverty should be measured based on consumption and the ability to purchase goods and services. They point out that indicators such as housing conditions also support the finding that material deprivation has decreased. The authors suggest that modern anti-poverty efforts should promote self-sufficiency through work requirements, job assistance, public employment, and access to resources for those unable to work. They emphasize the importance of bipartisan support for encouraging self-sufficiency.
