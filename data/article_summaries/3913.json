The Biden-Harris Administration has signed a new Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to implement the Tribal "477 Program," which allows Tribal governments and organizations to consolidate federal funding for job training, workforce development, and economic development into a single plan. The MOA has been signed by 12 federal agencies and aims to streamline plan approval procedures and reaffirm the decision-making authority of the Secretary of the Interior. The new agreement supports Tribal sovereignty and self-determination, reduces joblessness in Indian country, and improves federal customer service. Since its enactment in 1992, Tribal governments have successfully used the 477 Program to provide employment and training services based on their unique goals. The new MOA will further strengthen the economic stability and mobility of families in Indian Country and promote economic resilience through employment and training services. This is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to improving employment, job training, and economic development opportunities for Tribal Nations.
