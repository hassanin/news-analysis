The White House is taking steps to advance pay equity and promote women's economic security. President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to equal pay and closing gender and racial wage gaps. They recognize that reliance on past salary and lack of pay transparency can contribute to discriminatory pay. In 2020, the average woman working full-time earned 83 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterpart. Disparities are even greater for Black women, Native American women, Latinas, and certain Asian women. Vice President Harris is hosting a virtual summit to tackle pay discrimination. The Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions, including addressing pay equity in the federal workforce, promoting pay equity for federal contractors, strengthening pay equity audits by federal contractors, ensuring access to good-paying jobs, and addressing discrimination against caregivers. These actions build on previous steps taken by the Administration, such as providing relief through the American Rescue Plan, supporting child care providers, increasing the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, raising the minimum wage for federal workers and contractors, and promoting diversity and competition in the workforce.
