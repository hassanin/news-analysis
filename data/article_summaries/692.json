President Biden has signed the CHIPS & Science Act, aiming to restore America's leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and ensure reliable access to chips for consumers, businesses, and the military. The act provides investments to build a resilient American supply chain for semiconductors that are used in various products. The Department of Commerce has announced a preliminary memorandum of terms for $162 million to be awarded to Microchip Technology, which will help boost their production and create over 700 jobs. This investment is part of President Biden's goal to make semiconductors in America and reduce reliance on global supply chains. The administration aims to strengthen American supply chains, create jobs, and protect national security through its Investing in America agenda.
