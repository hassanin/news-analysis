The global trade system is facing strain due to countries like China violating market principles and distorting global markets. The United States faces higher barriers on its exports in foreign markets compared to what foreign producers face when exporting to the U.S. The Trump administration aims to update existing trade relationships to maximize the benefits for the U.S. and its citizens in the 21st century. While trade has produced both costs and benefits throughout American history, recent empirical evidence suggests that some trade flows with China have left certain Americans worse off. However, the administration believes that by strengthening and updating trade agreements, the U.S. can capitalize on opportunities to benefit American businesses and workers, particularly in the energy and agriculture sectors.
