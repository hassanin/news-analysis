The Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to address climate change impacts in federal government decisions and protect people from the effects of the climate crisis. They are expanding the use of the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (SC-GHG) metric, which calculates the costs of climate change impacts in areas such as agriculture, public health, and labor productivity. This metric allows for better comparisons of costs and benefits in agency decisions. The Administration is directing agencies to consider the SC-GHG in budgeting, procurement processes, and environmental reviews conducted under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). By integrating the SC-GHG, the federal government can reduce emissions, save taxpayer dollars, and mitigate the effects of the climate crisis.
