Senator Manchin's recent comments on FOX News contradict his discussions with the President, White House staff, and his public statements. He had previously committed to supporting the Build Back Better framework and pledged to negotiate in good faith. Just this week, he submitted a written outline for a bill that aligned with the President's framework. However, his recent comments indicate a sudden reversal in his position and a breach of his commitments.

Senator Manchin claims that his change of position is due to concerns about inflation, but the Penn Wharton Budget Institute, a think tank he often cites, recently stated that the Build Back Better Act would have minimal impact on inflation. Additionally, many leading economists that Senator Manchin consults also support the bill.

The Build Back Better plan aims to lower costs for families by reducing child care expenses, prescription drug prices, and health care premiums. It also provides tax cuts for families with children. The plan is fully paid for and fiscally responsible, reducing the deficit in the long run. The Congressional Budget Office report that Senator Manchin refers to analyzes an unfunded extension of the bill, which is not what the President has proposed.

Senator Manchin's concerns about the climate provisions in Build Back Better are also unfounded. The plan will create jobs in the clean energy sector, including in West Virginia.

The statement concludes by expressing disappointment in Senator Manchin's reversal and vows to continue pressing him to honor his prior commitments. It highlights the impact of his decision on families struggling with high insulin costs and the need for affordable child care. The statement emphasizes the importance of the Build Back Better plan and the commitment to help Americans with various issues, including child care, health care, prescription drug costs, and climate change. The fight for the plan will continue in the coming year.
