President Obama announced that he would be commuting the prison terms of eight individuals who were sentenced under an unfair system. These individuals had already served more than 15 years in prison, and if they had been sentenced under the current law, many of them would have already completed their sentences. The President emphasized that this action was an important step towards restoring justice and fairness, but he urged lawmakers to continue working on bipartisan sentencing reform measures in the new year. He stated that it is crucial to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and that the justice system delivers equal treatment for all.
