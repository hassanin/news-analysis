Today marks the 79th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, when American and Allied forces stormed the shores of Normandy in the greatest amphibious military operation in history. The brave service members who participated in this operation are considered the greatest generation in our history, as they fought against fascism and willingly risked their lives for our liberty. It is important that we honor our World War II veterans and service members, as they demonstrated unwavering loyalty to our country. We have a sacred obligation to support them, their families, caregivers, and survivors. As we reflect on their service and sacrifice, let us also reaffirm our commitment to the future they fought for, one that upholds freedom, democracy, equality, and opportunity for all.
