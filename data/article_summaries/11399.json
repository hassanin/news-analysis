President Barack Obama has transmitted a revised alternative plan for locality pay increases for civilian federal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay systems in January 2017. The revised plan supersedes the original plan issued on November 29, 2016. The President states that the adjustments that would otherwise take effect are inappropriate due to the "national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare." The President acknowledges that civilian federal employees have made significant sacrifices in the past and that tough choices are necessary to keep the nation on a sustainable fiscal course. Under current law, locality pay increases averaging 28.49 percent and costing $26 billion would go into effect in January 2017, but federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases. The President has determined that the total combined cost of the 1.0 percent across-the-board base pay increase and the varying locality pay increases will be 2.1 percent of basic payroll. The revised alternative plan for locality payments will generate costs of 1.1 percent of basic payroll. The President concludes that these decisions will not materially affect the ability to attract and retain a well-qualified federal workforce.
