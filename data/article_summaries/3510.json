President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan, which was declared in Executive Order 13067 in 1997, is to continue beyond November 3, 2022. This decision comes in light of the military takeover of the Sudanese government in October 2021, which has reversed the progress made towards democracy between 2019 and 2021. The crisis that led to the initial declaration of the national emergency has not been resolved, and the situation in Darfur continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
