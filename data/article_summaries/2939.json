President Joe Biden has authorized additional disaster assistance for the state of Florida in response to Hurricane Ian. The increase in federal funding will support debris removal and emergency protective measures. Under the major disaster declaration issued in September, federal funding was made available at 100% of eligible costs for a 30-day period. The president's order extends this funding for an additional 30 days. For more information, media can contact the FEMA news desk.
