Vice President Biden released a statement praising the budget and tax agreement that Congress negotiated. He highlighted that the agreement reverses sequestration and avoids a government shutdown. The agreement also includes permanent tax credits for working and middle-class families, extends tax credits for clean energy, and provides support for job seekers. Additionally, the budget invests in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for medical research and programs under the Violence Against Women Act. It also allocates funds to address the backlog of rape kits and support the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Lastly, Vice President Biden mentions the importance of supporting Central American countries in addressing violence, poverty, and corruption. Overall, while the agreement is not perfect, it is seen as a step towards economic growth and security, as well as a move towards consensus-based governing.
