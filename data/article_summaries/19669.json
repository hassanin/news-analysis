The White House Office of the Press Secretary issued a statement condemning the Syrian government's recent convictions and sentencing of human rights lawyers Haitham Maleh and Muhanad al-Hasani, as well as the re-arrest of Ali Abdullah. These actions are seen as part of a concerning pattern of government crackdowns on lawyers and civil society activists. The statement calls on the Syrian government to uphold its responsibilities under international human rights agreements, including ending arbitrary arrests and detention and allowing freedom of expression and association. It also urges Syria to release Maleh, al-Hasani, Abdullah, and others who have been imprisoned for peacefully expressing their views.
