The article is a press briefing by Antony Blinken, National Security Advisor to the Vice President, discussing Vice President Biden's trip to Iraq. This is Biden's third trip to Iraq as Vice President and his 15th trip overall since 2001. The purpose of the trip is to assess the progress in Iraq and discuss any problems that may arise. Biden has had meetings with various Iraqi leaders, including Prime Minister Maliki, President Talibani, and the Speaker of the Council of Representatives, al-Samarrai. The main issue discussed is the disqualification of candidates for the upcoming elections, and the Vice President's position is that the process should be fair and transparent to ensure the credibility and inclusiveness of the elections. The Vice President is not proposing any solutions but is listening to the Iraqis and offering support if needed. The Vice President's trip is part of the ongoing effort to maintain a high-level focus on Iraq from the White House and build a more normal relationship with Iraq as US troops withdraw.
