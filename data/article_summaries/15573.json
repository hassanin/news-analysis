Bob Strauss, a prominent leader in the Democratic Party, has passed away. He was highly respected by presidents from both parties for his advice, instincts, and commitment to public service. He played a crucial role in expanding American exports as President Carter's trade representative and represented US interests during a time of significant change as Ambassador to the Soviet Union and later the Russian Federation under President Bush. Bob Strauss was known for his sense of humor and will be greatly missed. The President and Michelle express their condolences to his children, family, and countless friends.
