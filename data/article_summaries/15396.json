The Peace Corps volunteers have contributed to various areas such as education, health, business, agriculture, and environmental protection. The proclamation honors the volunteers and their commitment to global peace and friendship. It also pays tribute to Sargent Shriver, the founding director of the Peace Corps, and calls upon Americans to observe the anniversary with appropriate programs and activities.
