Dr. Gordon met with President Mahmoud Abbas, Secretary General of the Executive Committee of the PLO Hussein AlSheikh, Head of Palestinian General Intelligence Services Majid Faraj, and Palestinian business leaders. He emphasized the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to support the Palestinian people and their right to security, dignity, and self-determination, as well as the future establishment of a Palestinian state. Discussions also focused on the situation in Gaza and the imperative of delivering humanitarian assistance and protecting civilians.

The situation in the West Bank and the importance of preserving stability were also discussed, with concerns raised about extremist settler violence. Dr. Gordon outlined principles for post-conflict planning, including efforts on reconstruction, security, and governance in Gaza. The revitalization of the Palestinian Authority and the strengthening of Palestinian Authority Security Forces were emphasized.
