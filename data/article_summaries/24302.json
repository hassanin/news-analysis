President Obama has approved additional actions to enhance the implementation of the counter-ISIL campaign. This includes the deployment of up to 450 additional U.S. military personnel to train, advise, and assist Iraqi Security Forces in eastern Anbar province. These new advisors will work to build the capacity of Iraqi forces to plan, lead, and conduct operations against ISIL. The President has also directed the expedited delivery of essential equipment and materiel to Iraqi forces to ensure they have the necessary equipment to effectively fight ISIL. Additionally, the United States is working with the Iraqi government, the global counter-ISIL coalition, and the United Nations to develop a framework to support the people and communities living in areas newly liberated from ISIL. The U.S. is also intensifying efforts with coalition partners to stem the flow of foreign fighters to and from Iraq and Syria. The President reaffirmed U.S. support for Prime Minister Al-Abadi's efforts to build an inclusive and effective governance structure within Iraq.
