In an article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. emphasizes the importance of homeownership and affordable housing during National Homeownership Month. He acknowledges that a home provides pride, security, and comfort, and that everyone should be able to afford a home of their own. However, he recognizes that housing prices are increasing, making it difficult for people to find affordable options. To address this issue, his administration has released a Housing Supply Action Plan to close the nationwide housing shortfall. The plan includes incentivizing states and localities to create more housing, improving financing tools, addressing barriers to housing supply and affordability, and investing in affordable housing and down payment assistance. President Biden also highlights the inequities in the housing system, particularly for Black and Brown Americans, and commits to ending unlawful housing discrimination and advancing equity. He aims to expand access to homeownership opportunities and ensure fair appraisals for homes. The article concludes by urging the nation to lower costs and expand access to safe and affordable homes for all Americans.
