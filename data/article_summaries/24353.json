President Obama will hold a Presidential Forum on community service hosted by former President George H.W. Bush and the Points of Light Institute at the George Bush Presidential Library Center. The event aims to celebrate the contributions of over 4,500 Daily Point of Light award winners and honor President Bush's legacy of service and civic engagement. It will also build upon President Obama's "United We Serve" call to service, which challenges Americans to engage in sustained, meaningful community service. The forum will take place on October 16th and will be held at Texas A&M University.
