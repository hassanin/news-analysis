In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims April 17, 2012, as National Equal Pay Day. He highlights the importance of working women in powering America's economy and sustaining the middle class. However, he notes that in 2010, women who worked full-time earned only 77 percent of what their male counterparts earned. The pay gap was even larger for African American and Latina women. Obama emphasizes the need for fair pay for all parents, as women are increasingly becoming breadwinners in families. He mentions the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the National Equal Pay Task Force as measures his administration has taken to address wage discrimination. Obama concludes by calling upon all Americans to recognize the value of women's skills and contributions, acknowledge wage discrimination, and work towards achieving equal pay.
