The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will invest over $14 billion from the President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other appropriations in fiscal year 2022 to strengthen port and waterway supply chains and bolster climate resilience. This funding will support over 500 projects across 52 states and territories. The investments aim to improve infrastructure, enhance the nation's supply chain, create economic opportunities, and protect communities from the impacts of climate change. The funding will be used to expand capacity at key ports, allow passage of larger vessels, and improve the country's ability to move goods. Additionally, the funding will be used to protect communities from climate change and enhance environmental justice. The investments will help reinforce disaster mitigation and recovery efforts in communities affected by extreme weather events and reduce risks associated with climate change. Overall, these investments reflect the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to modern and resilient infrastructure, racial equity, combating climate change, and creating job opportunities.
