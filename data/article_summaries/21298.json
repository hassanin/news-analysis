In this statement, President Obama discusses the situation in Libya and the end of Muammar Qaddafi's regime. He highlights the peaceful protests in Libya earlier in the year and the brutal crackdown by the Qaddafi regime. The international community, including the United States, took action to protect Libyan civilians and launched a military operation. The Libyan opposition, supported by the international coalition, successfully confronted the regime and the tide turned in their favor. The President emphasizes that although Qaddafi's rule is over, there is still fighting in some areas and calls for a peaceful and inclusive transition in Libya. The United States will continue to support the Libyan people and work with the Transitional National Council. The President also pays tribute to the American lives lost due to Qaddafi's regime and acknowledges the efforts of the military without having to deploy U.S. troops on the ground. He expresses gratitude for the unity and support from friends, allies, and Arab coalition members. The President concludes by commending the Libyan people for their courage and character and assures them of continued support in achieving the Libya they deserve.
