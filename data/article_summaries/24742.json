Mission Innovation is an initiative launched by 20 countries, representing 80 percent of global clean energy research and development (R&D) budgets, to double their respective R&D investments over five years. The goal is to accelerate clean energy innovation in order to limit the rise in global temperatures to below 2ËšC. The Breakthrough Energy Coalition, spearheaded by Bill Gates, is an independent initiative that will provide early stage capital to take innovative technologies from research programs and bring them to the marketplace. The coalition consists of 28 influential investors committed to building energy solutions at scale. The U.S. Government has committed to doubling its investment in clean energy R&D over five years and will initially focus on early stage research and development. The current U.S. Government investment portfolio in clean energy research and development is over $5 billion and covers a wide range of technologies.
