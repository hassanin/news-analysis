President Obama has declared a major disaster in West Virginia and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following storms, tornados, flooding, mudslides, and landslides that occurred between February 29 and March 5, 2012. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Lincoln, Marion, and Wayne, which can be used for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. State and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, can also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Deanne Criswell has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for the federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made based on further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free phone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.
