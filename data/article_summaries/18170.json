The United States and European Union (EU) collaborate on security issues, particularly regarding the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) which focuses on crisis management missions worldwide. Cooperation between the EU and NATO is of particular importance to the US as a NATO member. In 2011, a framework agreement was signed allowing the US to contribute civilian personnel to EU CSDP missions, strengthening coordination during crises. The US has contributed to EU missions in Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Negotiations are ongoing for an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement to facilitate logistical support cooperation. The US has also worked with the EU in Mali, DRC, and Somalia, providing military training and logistical support to combat terrorism and promote security sector reform. Additionally, the US and EU naval vessels collaborate with other international partners to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa.
