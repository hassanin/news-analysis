The challenge calls on community leadership to build outreach efforts to reach the remaining uninsured. At the end of the open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of new Marketplace signups in participating communities to estimates of the eligible uninsured population to determine which communities made the most progress.
