President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring October 18-24, 2015, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. The proclamation recognizes the important role that minority-owned businesses play in the American economy and emphasizes the need to support and empower these businesses. Minority-owned firms make up over one-fifth of all businesses in the US and contribute $1 trillion to the economy each year. The Obama Administration has implemented measures to support small businesses, including tax cuts, and is pursuing a trade agenda that will allow these businesses to participate in the global economy. The proclamation calls on all Americans to celebrate Minority Enterprise Development Week and acknowledge the contributions of minority enterprises to the nation.
