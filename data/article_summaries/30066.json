On January 30, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order regarding the detention operations at the U.S. Naval Station Guantánamo Bay. The order revokes a previous order to close the detention facilities and states that the operations at Guantánamo Bay are legal, safe, and humane. It also emphasizes the ongoing armed conflict with al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and associated forces, as well as the need to detain certain individuals to protect against threats to the security of the United States. The order allows for the transportation of additional detainees to Guantánamo Bay when necessary and requires the Secretary of Defense to recommend policies regarding the disposition of individuals captured in connection with an armed conflict. It also establishes procedures for the periodic review of detainees and clarifies that existing laws and authorities relating to the detention of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents are not affected by the order. The order concludes by stating that it does not impair the authority of executive departments and agencies, is subject to applicable law and appropriations, and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States.
