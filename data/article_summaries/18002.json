The White House released a statement regarding a counter-ISIL operation in Syria. U.S. personnel conducted the operation in eastern Syria, capturing an ISIL senior leader known as Abu Sayyaf and his wife Umm Sayyaf. Abu Sayyaf was killed during the operation while Umm Sayyaf was captured and is currently in U.S. military detention in Iraq. The operation also resulted in the freeing of a young Yezidi woman who was being held as a slave by the couple. The President authorized the operation based on the unanimous recommendation of his national security team and after sufficient intelligence was gathered. The operation was conducted with the consent of Iraqi authorities and in accordance with domestic and international law. The U.S. is working on determining the best course of action for the detainee, considering national security interests. The President expressed gratitude to the U.S. personnel and Iraqi authorities for their support in the successful mission. The U.S. will continue to work with Iraqi partners to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.
