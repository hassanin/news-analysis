The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, held a press briefing to discuss President Trump's FY2018 Budget. Mulvaney emphasized that the budget is focused on putting taxpayers first and reducing the size of the debt relative to the size of the economy. The budget aims to achieve sustained 3 percent economic growth, which Mulvaney believes is a reasonable and achievable goal. The budget also prioritizes national security, border security, law enforcement, veterans, school choice, and paid parental leave. Mulvaney addressed concerns about cuts to Medicaid, stating that the budget proposes to slow the growth of Medicaid spending and give states more control over the program. He also discussed proposed changes to Social Security retirement and federal retirement programs. Mulvaney defended the budget's reductions in climate science programs, arguing that the previous administration had overspent in this area. He also addressed the funding for the proposed border wall, stating that it is a priority for the President. Mulvaney defended the reductions in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, stating that it is no longer necessary given increased domestic production of oil. Finally, he mentioned that the budget proposes changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to include work requirements and phase out certain exemptions.
