This article is a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House, discussing the termination of certain immunities granted to the Development Fund for Iraq and certain Iraqi property and interests in property. The President explains that he has issued an Executive Order to end the prohibitions on any judicial process with respect to the Development Fund for Iraq and Iraqi petroleum, petroleum products, and interests therein. He states that this action is a result of the situation in Iraq significantly improving, including progress in resolving outstanding debts and claims from the previous regime. However, the national emergency declared in previous Executive Orders will remain in place, and the immunities enjoyed by the Government of Iraq and its property under applicable law will not be affected. The President has delegated the authority to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take necessary actions to carry out the purposes of the Executive Order. All agencies of the United States Government are directed to comply with the provisions of the order. The letter concludes by enclosing a copy of the Executive Order.
