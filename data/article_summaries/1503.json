President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13664, with respect to South Sudan, is to continue beyond April 3, 2022. This decision is based on the ongoing situation in South Sudan, which is marked by activities that threaten peace, security, and stability in the region. These activities include widespread violence, atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment and use of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations. President Biden has determined that the national emergency is necessary to address the unusual and extraordinary threat posed by these circumstances to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
