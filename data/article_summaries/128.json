President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of New Hampshire due to a severe storm and flooding that occurred from July 17 to July 19, 2021. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in Cheshire County. Additionally, federal funding will be available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Robert Fogel has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and further designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by damage assessments.
