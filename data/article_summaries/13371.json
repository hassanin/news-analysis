President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Texas and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding occurred between October 22-31, 2015. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in various counties, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Kevin L. Hannes has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments. Residents and business owners who sustained losses can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free numbers will operate seven days a week from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. until further notice. Further information can be obtained from the FEMA news desk.
