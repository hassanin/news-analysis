In a statement by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz, it is confirmed that the President's executive actions on immigration are lawful, as stated by Judge Howell's decision in the D.C. District Court. The Department of Justice and scholars have also supported this assertion. The Supreme Court and Congress have previously established that federal officials can determine priorities in enforcing immigration laws, and the President's actions align with those of previous administrations from both parties. The court has dismissed Sheriff Arpaio's lawsuit.
