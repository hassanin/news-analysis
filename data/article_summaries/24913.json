President Barack Obama has issued a message regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor. Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act requires the President to publish a notice in the Federal Register and transmit it to Congress in order to extend a national emergency beyond its anniversary date. President Obama has sent the notice to the Federal Register, stating that the national emergency and related measures dealing with the former regime of Charles Taylor are to continue in effect beyond July 22, 2011. The actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others, including the unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and the removal and secreting of funds and property, continue to undermine Liberia's transition to democracy and its political, administrative, and economic institutions and resources. These actions and policies pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States, thus necessitating the continuation of the national emergency.
