In his weekly message, President Barack Obama called on Congress to put aside politics and focus on solving the country's problems. He criticized Republican leaders for obstructing progress on important legislation, including a bill that would boost the economy, protect jobs for teachers and police officers, and assist first-time homebuyers. He also mentioned a bill that would hold oil companies accountable for the disasters they cause, by eliminating the current $75 million liability limit. Additionally, he highlighted the obstruction of 136 highly qualified individuals nominated for government positions. Obama emphasized that officials in Washington should prioritize the next generation over the next election. He expressed disappointment in the political gamesmanship that hindered progress on crucial issues affecting people's lives. He urged for cooperation and a common purpose among leaders, emphasizing the need to focus on the interests of the people and solve problems rather than scoring political points.
