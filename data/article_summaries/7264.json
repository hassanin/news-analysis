In a speech commemorating the 13th anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Joe Biden praised the legislation as the most consequential piece of healthcare legislation since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. He thanked former President Barack Obama for his achievement and credited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her instrumental role in getting the law passed. Biden highlighted the positive impact of the ACA, such as providing coverage for pre-existing conditions, allowing young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, and expanding Medicaid to cover an additional 20 million people. He also emphasized his administration's efforts to lower prescription drug prices and make healthcare more affordable, including capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors on Medicare and negotiating lower drug prices. Biden criticized Republicans for their opposition to the ACA and their attempts to repeal or weaken the law, warning that such actions would have a devastating impact on millions of Americans. He called for strengthening Medicare and Social Security and vowed to protect these programs. Biden concluded his speech by urging Americans to continue fighting for affordable healthcare for all.
