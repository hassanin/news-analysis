Vice President Joe Biden has released a statement in response to a new report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on the employment impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the Recovery Act. The CBO report estimates that the Recovery Act has already created as many as 2.8 million jobs and is on track to create as many as 3.6 million jobs by the end of the year. Without the Recovery Act, the report suggests that the unemployment rate could be as high as 11 percent. The Vice President emphasizes that while the report is important validation of the success of the Recovery Act, the focus remains on helping the millions of Americans still looking for work. The administration plans to continue investing in job creation projects and advocating for additional job creation investments to build on the progress made through the Recovery Act.
