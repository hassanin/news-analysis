The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director, Jim Carroll, released a statement in honor of National Police Week. The statement emphasizes the dedication and sacrifice of law enforcement officers who protect and serve the community. It also highlights the challenges and dangers that officers face while combating drug trafficking and supporting those struggling with addiction. The ONDCP is committed to standing with law enforcement officers and President Trump's administration supports their efforts. National Police Week is dedicated to honoring fallen officers and their families. This year, 307 fallen heroes will be memorialized on the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, D.C. The statement mentions two officers who lost their lives while working on High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Task Forces. Detective Jorge DelRio was shot while serving a search warrant, and Agent Billy Clardy III was killed during a narcotics operation. The ONDCP's National HIDTA program helps coordinate drug enforcement efforts among federal, state, local, and tribal agencies in critical regions of the country.
