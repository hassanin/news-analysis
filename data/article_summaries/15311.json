President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Hawaii following the tsunami waves that hit on March 11, 2011. This declaration allows federal funding to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas, including Hawaii County, Maui County, and the City and County of Honolulu. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Michael L. Karl has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
