During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest provided updates on the situation in Syria and Hurricane Joaquin. He discussed the efforts of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to prepare for the hurricane and urged Americans in potentially affected areas to monitor emergency information and follow instructions from local officials. Earnest also addressed the recent Secret Service scandal, in which agents accessed a committee chairman's personnel file, stating that the agency takes the matter seriously and that those responsible will be held accountable. He discussed the ongoing conflict in Syria and Russia's military operations, stating that Russia's actions are counterproductive to the fight against ISIS and risk deepening the sectarian conflict in Syria. Earnest also commented on the potential for diplomatic consequences for Russia's actions, stating that while the United States will continue to work with Russia on de-conflicting military operations, the consultations do not represent a change in policy regarding military-to-military cooperation as a result of Russia's actions in Ukraine. Finally, Earnest addressed domestic issues such as the EPA's new ozone standard and the possibility of working with Speaker John Boehner on key priorities before he leaves office.
