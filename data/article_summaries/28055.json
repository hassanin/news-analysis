The article is a statement from President Donald Trump, addressed to the Senate of the United States, regarding the transmission of the Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation (the "Beijing Convention") for ratification. The Beijing Convention, adopted in 2010, aims to prevent and punish terrorism targeting civil aviation and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It replaces and supersedes previous conventions from 1971 and 1988. The Beijing Convention establishes a framework that criminalizes certain terrorist acts and requires states to cooperate in preventing and investigating suspected crimes. The United States will need to make changes to its domestic laws to implement the provisions of the Beijing Convention, and proposed legislation is being transmitted to Congress. President Trump recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Beijing Convention, subject to certain reservations and understandings.
