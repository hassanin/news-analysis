The article discusses the rise in unaccompanied children from Central America crossing into the United States. These children are vulnerable and often become victims of violence and abuse during their journey. To address this issue, the President has directed the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate a government-wide response. The first priority is to provide humanitarian aid to these children, including housing, food, and medical treatment. The government is also working with Central American countries to combat gang violence, improve economic development, and enhance their capacity to receive and reintegrate returned families and children. The US government is providing financial support to Central American governments for repatriation centers and training for immigration officials. They are also launching programs to improve citizen security, establish youth outreach centers, and support community policing efforts. Additionally, the US plans to provide $161.5 million for CARSI programs to address security and governance challenges in the region. The Department of Justice and DHS are taking additional steps to enhance enforcement and removal proceedings to quickly return unlawful migrants to their home countries. The article also emphasizes that these children and adults with children are not eligible for immigration reform or the DACA process.
