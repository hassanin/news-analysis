The GOP Tax Scam 2.0 is criticized for prioritizing the interests of rich special interests and corporations over reducing the deficit or competing globally. House Republicans are accused of demanding cuts to programs that benefit hard-working Americans, while proposing to spend hundreds of billions on tax breaks for big corporations. This means they are prioritizing restoring tax breaks for corporations over tax credits that have helped reduce child poverty. Additionally, the tax giveaways would benefit large profitable corporations, but potentially lead to the outsourcing of clean energy jobs and higher energy costs for American families.
