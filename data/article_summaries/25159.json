On July 10, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order regarding the appointment of administrative law judges (ALJs). The order states that ALJs play a significant role in conducting proceedings under the laws of the United States and must display appropriate temperament, legal acumen, impartiality, and sound judgment. The order acknowledges recent litigation, particularly the Supreme Court's decision in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission, which raised questions about the method of appointing ALJs and the constitutionality of competitive examination and selection procedures. 

To address these concerns and provide agency heads with more flexibility in assessing prospective appointees, the order places the position of ALJ in the excepted service, specifically under Schedule E. This change allows agencies to assess critical qualities in ALJ candidates without complicated examination processes that may not reflect the agency's needs. The order also emphasizes the importance of agency adjudications and aims to promote confidence in and the durability of these processes. 

The order amends Civil Service Rule VI to reflect the placement of ALJs in the excepted service and outlines the requirements for ALJ appointments, including possessing a professional license to practice law and being authorized to practice law under the laws of a state or territory. The order further directs the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to adopt necessary regulations and provide guidance for the transition to the new appointment process.

It is important to note that this executive order does not impair existing authorities or affect the functions of executive departments or agencies. It is to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
