The Biden Administration is launching a 100-day plan to enhance the cybersecurity of the United States' electric infrastructure. This initiative is part of a broader cybersecurity effort aimed at safeguarding critical infrastructure from persistent and sophisticated cyber threats. The plan is a collaboration between the Department of Energy (DOE), the electricity industry, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The goal is to improve cybersecurity defenses, including detection, mitigation, and forensic capabilities, as owners and operators modernize their systems. The partnership between the government and private sector is crucial in addressing the urgent cybersecurity challenge, as much of the critical infrastructure is privately owned and operated. These efforts align with President Biden's commitment to strengthening national and economic security and countering cyber threats from adversaries.
