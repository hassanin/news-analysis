The article discusses the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in the United States 150 years ago. On May 10, 1869, the final golden spike was driven into the ground at Promontory Summit, Utah, joining the tracks of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroads. This rail line connected the eastern and western states, allowing for easier coast-to-coast travel. The article honors the thousands of workers, including those of Irish and Chinese descent, freed slaves, Native Americans, Civil War veterans, and Latter-day Saints, who made this engineering feat possible. It also acknowledges the vision of former leaders who understood the importance of infrastructure in supporting the economy. The completion of the transcontinental railroad had a significant impact on the country's development, promoting settlement in the American West and expanding prosperity.
