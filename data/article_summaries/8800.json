The United Nations Security Council has taken an important step to help the people of Haiti by imposing sanctions on those undermining stability in the country. The resolution proposed by Mexico and the United States received rapid and unanimous support, demonstrating the international community's commitment to addressing the challenges contributing to Haiti's dire humanitarian situation. The measures will target not only those involved in violence, but also those who fund them. The United States has shown its commitment to supporting Haiti by delivering security equipment and assisting with the cholera outbreak. They also plan to engage the international community for further actions at the United Nations.
