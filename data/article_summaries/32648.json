In this article, Lisa Blatt, a liberal feminist lawyer, argues that Democrats should support Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Blatt, who has argued 35 cases before the Supreme Court, believes Kavanaugh is the most qualified nominee for the position and that having smart and engaged judges on the highest court is beneficial to everyone. She highlights Kavanaugh's ability to listen and his commitment to hiring female law clerks, which she sees as important for increasing gender diversity in the legal profession. Blatt emphasizes that she does not have a litmus test for nominees, but rather looks for well-qualified individuals with integrity who align with mainstream legal thought. She urges Democrats to stop attacking Kavanaugh and to support him based on his qualifications, intelligence, empathy, and integrity.
