The White House, along with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Education, and Sesame Workshop, has launched a national public service advertising campaign to promote healthy habits and prevent the spread of the H1N1 flu virus. The campaign features Sesame Street characters Elmo and Gordon explaining the importance of washing hands, sneezing into the bend of the arm, and avoiding contact with eyes, nose, and mouth. The PSAs will be distributed nationwide and will be supported by airtime donated by television stations. The campaign aims to educate children and families about the steps they can take to stay healthy and prevent the spread of the flu.
