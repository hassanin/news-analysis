First Lady Michelle Obama has announced a new public awareness campaign as part of her Reach Higher initiative. The campaign aims to encourage every student in America to pursue education beyond high school, whether through professional training programs, community colleges, or four-year universities. The First Lady will deliver remarks in the East Room of the White House to announce the campaign on October 19. She will also join LeBron James for a special event in Akron on October 21, highlighting the importance of post-secondary education. The event will take place at the University of Akron, where the LeBron James Family Foundation and the University have committed to financially covering a college education for qualified students from the Akron Public School district.
