President Barack Obama has proclaimed October 2014 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month in the United States. The proclamation highlights the contributions of Americans with disabilities to the country and emphasizes the importance of equal employment opportunities for all individuals. The theme for this year's observance is "Expect. Employ. Empower.," which emphasizes the right to dignity, respect, and a fair shot at success in the workplace. The proclamation also acknowledges the progress made through the Americans with Disabilities Act but recognizes the need for further efforts to ensure that individuals with disabilities have access to resources that support employment. The President urges all Americans to embrace the talents and skills of individuals with disabilities and promote equal employment opportunities.
