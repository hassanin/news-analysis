President Donald Trump welcomed NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to the White House to reaffirm their commitment to the NATO Alliance. The NATO Alliance has been instrumental in maintaining international peace and security for nearly seven decades. NATO allies played a crucial role in defeating communism and securing peace in Europe. The number of NATO member states has increased from 12 to 28, and Montenegro is set to become the 29th member. President Trump aims to work closely with all NATO allies to strengthen the partnership and address future challenges.
