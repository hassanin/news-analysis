First Lady Melania Trump hosted an event at the White House to celebrate mothers, ahead of Mother's Day. She expressed her belief that mothers should be celebrated every day for the strength, time, patience, and love they put into raising children. Melania recognized the unique role of military mothers and thanked them for their dedication and sacrifice on behalf of the country. She also thanked the Second Lady, Karen Pence, as well as Kellyanne Conway and Ivanka Trump, for their work on an executive order that would create more job opportunities for military spouses within the federal government. Melania then introduced her husband, President Donald Trump, who would be speaking next.
