Senator Daniel K. Akaka from Hawaii has expressed his support for proposals to extend tax breaks for middle-class families, extend unemployment insurance, and provide relief to small businesses and workers. He is disappointed that Senate Republicans unanimously opposed these proposals in order to continue the tax cuts for the wealthy, which he believes will add to the national deficit. Akaka believes that it is unconscionable to allow taxes to rise on struggling families during this difficult economy and refuses to let the middle-class tax cuts expire or abandon the unemployed. While he has reservations about continuing tax cuts for the wealthy, he will support the President's compromise proposal to help working families and people out of work.
