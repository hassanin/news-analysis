The White House Press Secretary issued a statement criticizing Republicans in the House of Representatives for trying to shut down the government. The statement highlighted that Congress has two main responsibilities: passing budgets and paying bills. Republicans were given the opportunity to pass a simple resolution to keep the government running for a few more weeks, but instead, they chose to demand the sabotage of the health care law as an ideological stance. The statement emphasized that Republicans have repeatedly attempted to defund or delay the health care law, but these efforts have been unsuccessful. The President is willing to work with Republicans to improve the health care law and address fiscal challenges, but not under the threat of a government shutdown that would harm the economy. The statement concluded by urging the House to listen to the American people and follow the Senate's lead in passing a bill to keep the government running.
