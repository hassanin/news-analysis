The President's Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity has introduced a new requirement for companies that sell software to the government. They must now have a robust software security program in place. This requirement applies to various types of software, including traditional commercial on-premise software, software provided as a service, and open-source software components. This initiative aims to address the growing concerns about cybersecurity, as ransomware attacks have caused significant disruptions to businesses and critical services worldwide. The government believes that building security into software products from the design phase to deployment is crucial for cyber resilience. By leveraging its procurement power, the federal government aims to improve the security of software used by everyone, including critical infrastructure. The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF), developed in collaboration with NIST and private sector partners, serves as a set of practices that companies must now follow when selling software to the government. Additionally, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will work with the private sector to outline guidance for companies to attest their compliance with the SSDF within the next 60 days.
