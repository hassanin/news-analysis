The White House is providing an additional $120 million in emergency assistance to the Horn of Africa, where over 9 million people are still in need of help. The funds are aimed at preventing the crisis from worsening in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia, where drought conditions are expected to negatively impact crop production. The United States has already provided over $1.1 billion in assistance since the crisis began in 2011. The statement also commends Ethiopia and Kenya for their efforts to mitigate food insecurity and host Somali refugees, and calls on the international community to continue supporting emergency assistance in the region.
