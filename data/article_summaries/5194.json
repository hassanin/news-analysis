In a speech at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Vice President Kamala Harris discussed the issue of human trafficking. She shared her personal experience visiting the town of Calexico on the U.S. border, where she witnessed tunnels used for trafficking guns, drugs, and human beings. Harris emphasized that trafficking is a highly profitable and heinous business, with the global industry estimated to be worth $150 billion. She highlighted that human trafficking is not only a problem abroad, but also within the United States, with 72% of trafficking victims in California being born in the country. Harris called for urgent action to address human trafficking, as the number of people at risk has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. She outlined various types of work for which people are trafficked, such as sexual exploitation, forced labor, and indentured servitude. Harris also stressed the economic impact of forced labor, which undermines supply chains and harms American workers. The Vice President announced the administration's National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking, which focuses on prevention, protection, prosecution, and partnerships. Harris emphasized the need to prioritize the most vulnerable populations, including women and girls, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQI+ individuals, Indigenous people, people with disabilities, migrants, and children in the foster care system. She called for collaboration between government, business leaders, non-profit organizations, and community leaders to effectively combat human trafficking.
