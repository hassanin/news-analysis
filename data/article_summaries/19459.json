President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 15 to May 21, 2016, as Emergency Medical Services Week. The proclamation recognizes the sacrifice and dedication of emergency medical services (EMS) professionals who work tirelessly to provide urgent and essential care to those in need. These professionals, including emergency medical technicians, paramedics, nurses, physicians, and others, embody the spirit of selflessness and courage that defines the American identity. The proclamation encourages Americans to show their support for their local EMS providers and to take steps to improve their own personal safety and preparedness.
