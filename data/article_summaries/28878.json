On January 31, 2020, a press briefing was held by Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, and other health officials to discuss the current situation of the novel coronavirus. Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emphasized that the risk to the American public at that time was low. He provided an update on the number of cases in China and other countries, and highlighted the CDC's aggressive public health response, which includes targeted airport screening and heightened education for healthcare professionals. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, spoke about the unknown aspects of the outbreak and the importance of taking precautionary measures. Secretary Azar announced that President Trump had declared the coronavirus a public health emergency in the United States and outlined temporary measures to detect and contain the virus. These measures included mandatory quarantine for U.S. citizens returning from Hubei Province, proactive entry health screening for U.S. citizens returning from the rest of Mainland China, and a temporary suspension of entry into the U.S. for foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmitting the virus. The officials emphasized that the risk to Americans remained low and that the government was working to keep it that way. They also expressed appreciation for China's efforts and cooperation and assured that the U.S. would continue to assist China in various ways. The press briefing addressed questions about the accuracy of tests, the enforcement of self-quarantine, travel bans, and legal challenges. The officials emphasized that the situation was evolving and that the government was prepared to take further measures if needed.
