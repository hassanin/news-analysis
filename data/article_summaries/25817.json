President Trump has commemorated Veterans Day by honoring and supporting veterans. Last year, he vowed to recover and return the remains of missing veterans from the Vietnam War, and this summer, 55 boxes containing the remains of U.S. Service Members from the Korean War were returned. President Trump is currently in Paris, France to participate in a commemoration for the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I. He is committed to caring for both current and past service members, signing the John McCain National Defense Authorization Act to strengthen the military and the VA MISSION Act to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Trump Administration is also holding VA employees accountable for misconduct and poor performance. President Trump stated that reforming the VA has been a top priority since the beginning of his administration.
