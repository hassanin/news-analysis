President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the threat from securities investments that finance certain companies of the People's Republic of China (PRC) will continue beyond November 12, 2021. The PRC has been exploiting U.S. capital to support the development of its military and security apparatus, posing a direct threat to the United States. Through the strategy of Military-Civil Fusion, civilian Chinese companies are compelled to support the PRC's military and intelligence activities. These companies raise capital by selling securities to U.S. investors and engage in other acts to ensure access to U.S. capital. The PRC military-industrial complex, by supporting the PRC's military and security apparatus, poses an extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC and its facilitation of repression or human rights abuses also pose unusual and extraordinary threats to the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13959, expanded by Executive Order 14032, regarding the threat from securities investments that finance certain companies of the People's Republic of China.
