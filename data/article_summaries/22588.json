The Obama Administration has announced new steps to increase energy security for America's warfighters. The Army will open a new lab in Michigan to develop energy technologies for combat vehicles. The lab will support the launch of the Army Green Warrior Convoy, which will test and demonstrate advanced vehicle technology. The Energy Department will launch a research competition to improve energy storage devices for battlefield and civilian applications. The Department of Defense (DoD) will make a commitment to deploy three gigawatts of renewable energy on military installations by 2025. The DoD will leverage private sector financing to meet these goals. The Department of Energy will fund a $30 million research competition to improve energy storage devices. The Administration has also made progress on the advanced biofuels initiative, aiming to produce biofuels from domestic feedstocks at a competitive price.
