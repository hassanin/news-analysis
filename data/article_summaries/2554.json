The second U.S.-Republic of Korea (ROK) Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) meeting took place in Washington D.C. on December 15, 2023. The NCG was established to strengthen the U.S.-ROK Alliance and enhance extended deterrence in the region. The meeting was led by officials from both countries, including representatives from defense, foreign affairs, intelligence, and military agencies. The United States reaffirmed its commitment to provide extended deterrence to the ROK and stated that any nuclear attack by North Korea against the United States or its allies would result in the end of the Kim regime. The meeting also discussed the progress made in U.S.-ROK nuclear deterrence cooperation and approved a work plan for the first half of 2024. The third NCG meeting will be held in Korea next summer.
