The White House has announced new measures to protect and restore the health of the ocean in celebration of National Ocean Month and World Ocean Day. These steps include the designation of a new national marine sanctuary in the Atlantic Ocean, a phase-out of single-use plastics in national parks and public lands, and the development of America's first-ever Ocean Climate Action Plan. The Biden-Harris Administration aims to prioritize environmental justice in ocean science and technology activities and investments. Throughout June, more announcements will be made regarding the administration's ocean agenda, including investments in coastal resilience, offshore wind farms, and sustainable ocean economic development. The administration recognizes that a healthy ocean is essential for the economy, health, and climate. Rising carbon dioxide levels are causing disruptions to ocean systems, such as rising sea levels and increased ocean acidity. NOAA and the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release a report on the contributions of the marine economy to the US, highlighting the impact of the pandemic on employment, sales, and GDP. The report will also identify areas of growth and innovation in various marine sectors.
