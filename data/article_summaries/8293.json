The U.S. government representatives, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Attorney General Merrick Garland, met with their Mexican counterparts to discuss the implementation of the U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities. The framework, adopted in October 2021, aims to improve bilateral security cooperation between the two countries. The United States and Mexico are committed to protecting the health and safety of their citizens, preventing criminal organizations from causing harm, and pursuing criminals for justice. They will work together to protect human rights, share information and best practices, prosecute law violators, and evaluate the impact of their efforts. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken several domestic actions to implement the framework's goals, such as releasing the National Drug Control Strategy, signing gun safety legislation, and committing to border infrastructure modernization. Successes achieved so far include advancements in public health, safe communities, human rights, combating transnational criminal organizations, addressing synthetic opioids, arms trafficking, human smuggling, securing modes of commerce, disrupting criminal financial networks, combating cybercrime, extraditions, combatting illicit finance, and implementing targeted financial measures. The United States plans to continue making progress in these areas over the next year.
