The White House has announced a new $1 billion initiative called the National Cancer Moonshot to eliminate cancer. The initiative aims to accelerate research efforts, enhance data access, and facilitate collaborations with researchers, doctors, philanthropies, patients, and biotech and pharmaceutical companies. The funding will be used to accelerate the development of new cancer detection and treatments, including prevention and cancer vaccine development, early cancer detection methods, cancer immunotherapy and combination therapy, genomic analysis of tumor and surrounding cells, enhanced data sharing, and pediatric cancer research. The initiative will also establish a virtual Oncology Center of Excellence at the FDA and create the Vice Presidentâ€™s Exceptional Opportunities in Cancer Research Fund to support high-risk, high-return research. The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs will also increase their investments in cancer research. The National Cancer Moonshot requires a whole-of-government approach and the Administration plans to work with Congress to launch the next phase of investments.
