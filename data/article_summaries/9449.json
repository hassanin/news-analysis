The proclamation highlighted the importance of freedom of religion and the act of prayer for many Americans. It called for prayers for comfort, healing, protection, and strength, and emphasized the significance of forgiveness, reconciliation, and gratitude. The proclamation also acknowledged the importance of religious liberty and called for the release of prisoners of conscience around the world. President Obama invited citizens to give thanks and pray according to their own faiths and consciences, seeking God's guidance, mercy, and protection for a more just world.
