The article discusses the impact of President Obama's Immigration Accountability Executive Actions on Asian American immigrant communities. It highlights that Asian Americans are one of the fastest-growing populations in the United States and are affected by every aspect of the immigration system. The executive actions aim to provide deferred action for parents of lawful permanent residents and U.S. citizens, expand eligibility for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, reduce family separation for those awaiting green cards, provide portable work authorization for high-skilled workers, enhance options for foreign entrepreneurs, and strengthen on-the-job training for STEM graduates. The article also mentions that while these executive actions are a step towards fixing the broken immigration system, comprehensive immigration reform is still needed from Congress. It outlines some key provisions of the Senate's bipartisan immigration bill, including providing a path to earned citizenship for undocumented immigrants, eliminating the backlog of family-based visas, streamlining legal immigration, and creating pathways for entrepreneurs.
