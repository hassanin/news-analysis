President Obama is signing a proclamation to designate Fort Monroe as a National Monument under the Antiquities Act. This decision is part of a series of executive actions aimed at creating jobs and strengthening the economy. Fort Monroe, a historic fort in Virginia, has played a significant role in the history of slavery, the Civil War, and the U.S. military. The implementation of the Fort Monroe Reuse Plan is expected to create nearly 3,000 jobs in Virginia. Fort Monroe was the site of General Benjamin Butler's "Contraband Decision," which provided freedom to thousands of enslaved people during the Civil War. The National Parks and Conservation Association study shows that national parks generate economic value and support private-sector jobs. Fort Monroe would become the 22nd national park unit in Virginia and the 396th nationwide.
