President Donald Trump issued an executive order on July 24, 2020, regarding healthcare and the importation of prescription drugs. The purpose of the order is to address the issue of high drug prices in the United States compared to other developed countries. The order suggests that one way to reduce price disparities is to increase the trade of prescription drugs between countries with lower prices and those with higher prices. The European Union is given as an example where the parallel trade of drugs has been estimated to reduce prices by up to 20 percent.

The order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take actions to expand safe access to lower-cost imported prescription drugs. This includes facilitating grants to individuals for waivers of the prohibition on drug importation, authorizing the re-importation of insulin products for emergency medical care, and completing the rulemaking process to allow importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada.

The order concludes with general provisions stating that it does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies, nor does it create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities. The implementation of the order is subject to applicable law and appropriations.
