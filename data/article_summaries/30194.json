During a briefing on the upcoming hurricane season, President Trump and his officials discussed the projected number of hurricanes and the preparedness of FEMA. Dr. Jacobs, a meteorologist, stated that the Atlantic Ocean is expected to have an above-average hurricane season, with 13 to 19 named storms, 6 to 10 hurricanes, and 3 to 6 major hurricanes. The projections are based on factors such as heat content in the ocean and a neutral to slight La Ni√±a in the Pacific Ocean. FEMA Administrator Gaynor mentioned that FEMA is well-prepared for the hurricane season, with ample funding, personnel, and supplies. He also emphasized the need to consider the challenges posed by COVID-19 when dealing with natural disasters. Vice President Pence commended FEMA and assured the American people that the government is ready to handle hurricanes amidst the pandemic. Secretary Ross mentioned that hurricane forecasts have improved, allowing for more precise three-day forecasts. President Trump also discussed the situation at the Mexico border and the progress of the border wall, as well as plans for upcoming press conferences on important subjects.
