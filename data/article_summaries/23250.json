The United States strongly condemns North Korea's nuclear test on September 9, 2016, considering it a serious threat to regional and international security. North Korea is the only country to have tested nuclear weapons in the 21st century. This test is the second one conducted by North Korea this year and follows a series of ballistic missile launches. North Korea claims that these missiles are intended to carry nuclear weapons targeting the United States, South Korea, and Japan. As Commander in Chief, the President has a responsibility to protect the American people and ensure that the United States leads the international community in responding to this threat. The United States does not and will not accept North Korea as a nuclear state. North Korea's actions have only served to isolate and impoverish its people, rather than achieving its national security and economic goals. This nuclear test violates multiple UN Security Council Resolutions and demonstrates North Korea's disregard for international norms. The President has spoken with the leaders of South Korea and Japan, and they have agreed to work with the UN Security Council and other partners to implement existing measures and impose new sanctions on North Korea. The United States is committed to defending its allies in the region through the deployment of defense capabilities.
