The senior administration officials discussed President Biden's "Action Plan on Health and Resilience in the Americas," which aims to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the region. The plan focuses on strengthening health systems and value chains, providing physical and mental healthcare, and addressing the needs of vulnerable populations. The U.S. government will invest in the Americas Health Corps to train 500,000 health workers in the Latin America and Caribbean region over the next five years. The officials also highlighted efforts to end the acute phase of COVID-19 in the region, promote recovery, strengthen global health security, and address the intersection of climate and health. The funding for these initiatives will come from a combination of existing programs and new investments.
