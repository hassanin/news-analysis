The United States has ratified several nuclear security treaties, including the 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, the Protocol of 2005 to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, and the Protocol of 2005 to the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf. These treaties are important for securing nuclear materials and preventing acts of nuclear terrorism. The United States' ratification of these treaties fulfills commitments made at the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit and the Proliferation Security Initiative 10th Anniversary Meeting, and demonstrates its dedication to global nuclear security. The United States encourages other countries to also become parties to these treaties.
