This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama on August 16, 2011, discusses the extension of Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Liberians residing in the United States. Since 1991, the US has provided safe haven for Liberians who were forced to flee their country due to armed conflict and civil strife. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was granted to these individuals, but it ended in 2007 when conditions in Liberia improved. President Bush then deferred the enforced departure of Liberians originally granted TPS, and President Obama extended that grant of DED to September 30, 2011. The memorandum states that there are compelling foreign policy reasons to extend DED for Liberians residing in the US. The president uses his constitutional authority to determine that it is in the foreign policy interest of the US to defer the removal of any Liberian national or person without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia and is under a grant of DED as of September 30, 2011. The grant of DED applies to individuals who have continuously resided in the US since October 1, 2002, with certain exceptions. The memorandum directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to implement a deferral of enforced departure and authorization for employment for eligible Liberians for 18 months from September 30, 2011.
