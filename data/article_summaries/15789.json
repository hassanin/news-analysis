The White House Rural Economic Forum is a meeting that brings together farmers, small business owners, private sector leaders, rural organizations, and government officials to discuss ideas and initiatives to promote economic growth in rural communities. The forum will have five breakout sessions, covering topics such as rural small business growth, agricultural innovation, strengthening the middle class, conservation and outdoor recreation, and infrastructure investments. President Obama will deliver opening and closing remarks and participate in two of the breakout sessions. The forum is hosted by the White House Rural Council, which focuses on increasing rural access to capital, spurring agricultural innovation, expanding infrastructure, and creating economic opportunities through conservation and outdoor recreation. The council recently released a report highlighting the administration's accomplishments in rural communities.
