The United States and Canada are celebrating the progress made under the Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership over the past two years. Both countries reaffirm their historic alliance, friendship, and commitment to overcoming challenges and realizing the full potential of their relationship. The partnership is based on shared security, prosperity, and democratic values, including the fight against climate change and respect for human rights and the rule of law.

The United States and Canada will work together to catalyze clean energy and create jobs, strengthen critical mineral and semiconductor supply chains, protect shared waters and the Arctic, advance diversity and inclusion, bolster global alliances, invest in collective defense and security, disrupt the illicit production and distribution of synthetic opioids, and manage migration collaboratively. These actions aim to build a more sustainable, equitable, secure, and prosperous world for both nations and improve the lives of people on both sides of the shared border.
