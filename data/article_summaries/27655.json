On World AIDS Day, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation honoring those who have lost their lives to AIDS and celebrating the progress made in combatting the disease. Since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, over 76 million people worldwide have been infected with HIV and 35 million have died from AIDS. In the United States, there are currently 1.1 million people living with HIV. The number of annual HIV infections in the US has decreased by 18% between 2008 and 2014, saving an estimated $14.9 billion in lifetime medical costs. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has supported over 13.3 million people with antiretroviral treatment. Efforts have also been made to support adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan African countries, who are at a higher risk of contracting HIV. While progress has been made, tens of thousands of Americans are still infected with HIV each year. The administration will continue to invest in testing initiatives and implement the PEPFAR Strategy for Accelerating HIV/AIDS Epidemic Control internationally. The proclamation encourages the governors of states, officials of other territories, and the American people to participate in activities to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS and support those living with HIV.
