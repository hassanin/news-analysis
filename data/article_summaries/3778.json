The White House is celebrating a year of progress since President Biden activated the entire government to advance environmental justice. In January 2021, Biden signed an Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis, which established an ambitious environmental justice agenda for the administration. The order ensured that federal agencies develop programs and policies to address the disproportionate impacts of pollution on marginalized communities. Over the past year, senior administration leaders have worked to secure investments in environmental justice, implement science-based regulations, strengthen enforcement of environmental and civil rights laws, and amplify the voices of environmental justice communities. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has focused on cleaning up abandoned mines and oil and gas wells, with initial grants being deployed. The DOI has also provided guidance for states interested in applying for federal grants for cleanup efforts. Additionally, efforts have been made to enhance resilience to extreme weather and climate change, deliver clean and affordable energy, and promote equitable and sustainable communities.
