The White House launched the American Campuses Act on Climate (ACAC) initiative to involve the higher-ed community in supporting a strong international climate agreement at the United Nations COP21 climate negotiations in Paris. The initiative includes a roundtable with campus and business leaders, a live-streamed conversation with EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, and a pledge for colleges and universities to accelerate the transition to low-carbon energy and promote sustainability. As of December 10, 318 colleges and universities have joined the pledge. Interested schools can email Outreach@ceq.eop.gov for instructions on how to join.
