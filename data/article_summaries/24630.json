First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden's Joining Forces initiative has announced a major effort by 130 medical schools and research facilities to combat PTSD and TBI (traumatic brain injury) in veterans and their families. These institutions, associated with the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), have pledged to train their medical students and current physicians to better diagnose and treat veterans and military families, as well as develop new research and clinical trials on PTSD and TBI. They will also share information and best practices through a collaborative web forum and work with the VA and Department of Defense to ensure the best care is provided. The initiative aims to improve education, research, and clinical care to meet the unique healthcare needs of the military and veterans communities. Examples of universities participating in the program include Virginia Commonwealth University, University of Pittsburgh, and University of South Florida. The Joining Forces initiative, created by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden, aims to support veterans and military families in areas such as employment, education, and wellness.
