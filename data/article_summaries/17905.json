This article announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Burma. The President issued Executive Order 13047 in 1997, certifying that the Government of Burma had committed large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in the country. This invoked a prohibition on new investment in Burma by US persons. The President also declared a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act due to the threat posed by the actions and policies of the Government of Burma. The President states that the actions and policies of the Government of Burma still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 1997 and the measures adopted to address that emergency will continue to be in effect for another year.
