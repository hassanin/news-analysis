On July 19, 2018, President Trump issued an executive order to address the skills crisis in the United States and improve education and job training programs. The order acknowledges the changing economy due to technology, automation, and artificial intelligence, and states that current education and job training programs are not adequately preparing Americans for the future. The order establishes the President's National Council for the American Worker, which includes various government officials and aims to work with private employers, educational institutions, labor unions, and other organizations to update and reshape the education and job training landscape. The Council is tasked with developing recommendations for a national strategy to empower American workers, fostering coordination among different stakeholders, and increasing transparency in education and job-training program options. Additionally, the order establishes the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board to provide advice on workforce policy and encourage investment in education, training, and re-training. The Council and the Board will receive funding and administrative support from the Department of Commerce, and other agencies may detail staff or provide administrative support as needed. The Council will convene meetings at least once per quarter and the Board will serve for a term of 2 years. The order also includes provisions for cooperation between agencies and the Council, termination of the Council after 2 years, and general provisions regarding implementation and legal effects.
