Senior officials from the United States, including Jim Carroll, Deputy Director of National Drug Control Policy, and Admiral Karl Schultz, Commandant of the United States Coast Guard, traveled to Colombia to meet with Colombian President Ivan Duque and other high-ranking officials. The purpose of the visit was to strengthen ties and increase cooperation between the two countries, particularly in combating the increase in coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia. The officials also commended the efforts of the Colombian police and military in eradicating coca, seizing and destroying cocaine, and dismantling narco-trafficking organizations. The United States emphasized its commitment to reducing drug demand through addiction treatment, recovery support, and prevention efforts, and pledged to continue working closely with the Colombian government on this issue.
