The joint statement by President Barack Obama of the United States and President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia emphasizes their commitment to preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and acts of nuclear terrorism. They agree to continuously upgrade nuclear security requirements and cooperate on effective export controls to prevent unauthorized actors from obtaining nuclear materials. They also declare their intent to increase the security of nuclear facilities worldwide, minimize the use of highly-enriched uranium, and dispose of surplus weapon-grade materials. Both countries commit to executing an agreement to dispose of weapons-grade plutonium. They also pledge to repatriate spent highly-enriched uranium fuel and work with other nations to secure and eliminate excess stocks of proliferation-sensitive nuclear materials. Additionally, they will collaborate on the development of low-enriched uranium fuel and improve physical protection systems at nuclear facilities. The two leaders aim to strengthen the ability of other nations to fulfill their nonproliferation obligations and combat illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. They also highlight the importance of safeguards in promoting confidence in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and express their shared vision of clean, safe, secure, and affordable nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The statement concludes by stating their intention to bring into force a bilateral agreement for cooperation in the field of nuclear energy and their commitment to expanding the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.
