President Biden has directed his administration to work urgently to ensure the safety and availability of infant formula during the Abbott Nutrition voluntary recall. The recall was initiated due to concerns about bacterial contamination at Abbott's facility in Michigan. The federal government has been working to address the shortfall in infant formula production by increasing production with other manufacturers, expediting imports, and establishing purchasing limits to prevent hoarding. Despite one of the largest production facilities being offline, more infant formula has been produced in the last four weeks than before the recall. However, families, especially those who rely on specialty formulas, are still concerned about availability. President Biden is announcing additional steps, including working with states to make it easier for vulnerable families to purchase formula with their WIC benefits and urging states to relax requirements for stores to keep a certain amount of formula in stock. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to monitor the situation and support the safe and rapid increase in production and distribution of baby formula.
