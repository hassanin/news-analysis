The White House Communications Director, Dan Pfeiffer, released a statement criticizing the House budget proposed by Republicans. Pfeiffer argues that the budget lacks balance, fairness, and shared responsibility. He claims that it would provide significant tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, while maintaining tax breaks for oil companies and hedge fund managers. To finance these tax breaks, the budget would undermine Medicare and other crucial areas such as education, research, and energy. Pfeiffer also states that the budget would transform Medicare into a voucher program, shifting more costs onto seniors over time. He further criticizes the budget's reliance on a theory that contributed to the recession and the decline of middle-class security. In contrast, Pfeiffer highlights President Obama's approach, which aims to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion through a balanced approach of asking the wealthiest to pay more, making necessary cuts, and reforming Medicare to reduce overpayments and improve care.
