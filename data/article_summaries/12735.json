The White House issued a statement by the President on the transition to all-digital programming on June 12, 2009. The switch to digital programming would free up airwaves for broadband and enhanced emergency communications. The President had previously worked with Congress to postpone the deadline for television broadcasters to end their analog signals, as millions of Americans would have been left without access to television. The administration had been working with state and local officials, broadcasters, and community groups to educate and assist Americans with the transition. The number of unprepared households had been reduced, but there would be no further delay. The President urged those who were not yet prepared to act immediately to avoid losing important news and emergency information, and encouraged prepared individuals to help others get ready.
