Vice President Harris will be visiting a union hall and training facility in Boston to highlight new steps the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to lower energy costs for working families and support good-paying jobs and manufacturing in America. The administration aims to cut energy costs for families ahead of winter and make energy efficient equipment more affordable for households. These steps will provide additional support for low- and moderate-income families and complement tax credits for energy-saving equipment installation and building upgrades. The focus is on lowering energy costs for American families, especially as extreme temperatures and volatile weather fueled by climate change become more common. The new measures will also contribute to reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Vice President Harris will be joined by members of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers to create an online resource for building owners and operators to find qualified labor for important building upgrades.
