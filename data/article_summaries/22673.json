This document is a fact sheet that outlines the U.S. policy standards and procedures for the use of force in counterterrorism operations outside the United States and areas of active hostilities. The document emphasizes the commitment to protecting American lives from the terrorist threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its associated forces while upholding laws and values. The policy states a preference for capturing terrorist suspects instead of using lethal force, as capturing them offers the best opportunity to gather intelligence and disrupt plots. Lethal force will only be used when necessary to prevent or stop attacks against U.S. persons, and only when capture is not feasible and no other reasonable alternatives exist. There are specific preconditions that must be met before lethal action can be taken, including the near certainty that the target is present, that non-combatants will not be harmed, that capture is not feasible, that the relevant government authorities cannot or will not address the threat, and that no other reasonable alternatives exist. The document also highlights the importance of respecting sovereignty and international law when using force in foreign territories. Decisions to use force are made at the highest levels of the U.S. Government, with input from relevant departments and agencies, and are subject to legal review. The document also mentions that if an operation is considered against a U.S. person, the Department of Justice will conduct additional legal analysis. The President's authority to take action in extraordinary circumstances is not limited by these standards and procedures. The appropriate Members of Congress will be kept informed about counterterrorism operations, and the relevant committees will be notified whenever an operation covered by these standards and procedures is conducted.
