President Donald Trump has unveiled an immigration plan that aims to transform America's broken immigration system into a source of national unity. The plan consists of two parts: strengthening border security and implementing a new merit-based legal immigration system. The president argues that a safer and more efficient immigration system benefits both Americans and immigrants. He criticizes special interests who profit from the current system and calls for bipartisan support in pursuing these reforms. The plan aims to modernize the legal admissions system, which has not been significantly reformed in over 50 years. The goal is to restore the American Dream for citizens and newcomers alike.
