Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg met with stakeholders in the goods movement supply chain to launch an initiative called Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW). FLOW aims to speed up the movement of goods, reduce delays, and lower costs for American consumers by improving information sharing and data transparency in the supply chain. Participants discussed progress made in addressing supply chain bottlenecks at ports, such as the decline in long-term dwelling containers and the reduction in empty containers. They emphasized the need for greater investment and collaboration to create a more reliable and accurate information exchange system. The initiative is seen as crucial for small- and medium-sized businesses and is particularly important in the face of supply chain disruptions caused by global events.
