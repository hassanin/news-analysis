In this letter from President Barack Obama to the Congress of the United States, he discusses his decision to implement an alternative pay plan for locality pay increases for civilian federal employees. He states that the economic conditions affecting the country require tough choices and shared sacrifice, and therefore he has determined it is appropriate to exercise his statutory alternative plan authority. He sets the alternative January 2011 locality pay rates, which will not materially affect the ability to attract and retain a well-qualified federal workforce. The current locality pay percentages will not increase from their 2010 levels, and the applicable 2011 locality pay rates for Alaska and Hawaii will be based on the 2010 locality pay levels. The attachment to the letter shows the specific locality pay rates established for 2010 and continued in 2011 under this alternative plan.
