On April 3, 2014, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in relation to South Sudan, due to the threat it posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This was done through Executive Order 13664 and was authorized by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The situation in South Sudan was marked by activities that threatened the peace, security, and stability of the country and the surrounding region. These activities included widespread violence and atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment and use of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations. The national emergency, which was declared to deal with this threat, is now being extended beyond April 3, 2019, for another year. This extension is in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
