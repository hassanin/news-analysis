The White House will be opening its gardens and grounds to the public this spring. Visitors can explore the South Lawn, Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, Rose Garden, and the White House Kitchen Garden. The event will take place on April 13 and 14, and tickets will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. Certain items are not allowed on the White House grounds, such as aerosols, animals (except guide dogs), pointed objects, oversized backpacks, balloons, beverages, and more. Strollers, wheelchairs, umbrellas, and cameras are permitted. In case of bad weather, the event may be cancelled, and attendees can call the 24-hour information line for updates.
