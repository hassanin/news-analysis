The Senate has overwhelmingly endorsed Finland and Sweden joining NATO, demonstrating a bipartisan commitment to the alliance. The quick ratification process is the fastest since 1981. The addition of Finland and Sweden will strengthen NATO's collective security and deepen the transatlantic partnership. The United States remains committed to the security of both countries and will continue to work together to confront aggression and ensure shared security. The president looks forward to signing the accession protocols and welcoming Finland and Sweden into NATO.
