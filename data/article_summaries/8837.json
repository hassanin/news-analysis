President Biden believes that it is our duty as Americans to take care of our veterans and their families. The American Jobs Plan aims to fulfill this obligation by creating jobs for veterans and their spouses, supporting small veteran-owned businesses, and improving healthcare through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The plan also addresses issues such as racial injustice, climate change, and competition from China. It will invest in infrastructure, including transportation, water systems, broadband access, and the care economy, benefitting both urban and rural communities where many veterans live. Specifically, the plan will allocate $18 billion to modernize VA healthcare facilities, which are currently aging and in need of improvement. It also aims to provide quality jobs for veterans and their spouses, recognizing the challenges they face in transitioning to civilian life. Additionally, the plan will expand opportunities for small veteran-owned businesses, recognizing that veterans are more likely to be self-employed.
