The Obama administration has reaffirmed its commitment to assisting the governments of Central America in building a safer and more prosperous future for their citizens. The administration plans to provide up to $750 million in fiscal year 2016 to support the Northern Triangle's Alliance for Prosperity Plan and other regional priorities. This represents a significant increase from previous years. However, the United States Congress has required that 25% of assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras be withheld until certain criteria are met, such as combating human smuggling and improving border security. An additional 50% of assistance may only be obligated after the Secretary of State certifies that each government is taking effective steps to combat corruption, protect human rights, and support equitable growth. The Obama administration also aims to deepen cooperation with Central America to reduce the number of migrants making the dangerous journey to the United States. They plan to expand access to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for vulnerable individuals and families from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The administration believes that addressing the underlying conditions in Central America, such as criminal violence and lack of economic opportunity, is crucial to reducing migration. They are working towards establishing safe, legal, and orderly migration options. Overall, the Obama administration is pursuing a comprehensive approach in Central America to promote good governance, prosperity, and citizen security.
