President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in Alabama due to the conditions resulting from Hurricane Irma. This declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate disaster relief efforts. The aim is to provide assistance in saving lives, protecting property, and ensuring public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to mobilize equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures will be funded at 75 percent by the federal government. Warren J. Riley has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
