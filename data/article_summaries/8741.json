President Biden is scheduled to visit Woodstock, New Hampshire, where he will deliver remarks on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and its impact on repairing and rebuilding the nation's roads and bridges. He will specifically highlight the NH 175 bridge over the Pemigewasset River, which has been on the state's "red list" of bridges in poor condition since 2013. The President will emphasize how repairing bridges like this not only improves public safety but also saves commuters time and money and boosts local economic competitiveness. He will also discuss how the infrastructure law is a game-changer for communities in need and strengthens American competitiveness against China. Additionally, he will highlight his commitment to bipartisan consensus and delivering for the American people. The President's visit is part of the administration's effort to communicate the benefits of the infrastructure law to people across the country.
