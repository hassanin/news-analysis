On January 18, 2011, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13563 titled "Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review." The order aims to improve the regulation and regulatory review process in the United States. It emphasizes the need for regulations to protect public health, safety, and the environment while promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation. The order highlights the importance of using the best available science, allowing for public participation and an open exchange of ideas, promoting predictability and reducing uncertainty, and using the most innovative and least burdensome tools for regulatory ends. It also emphasizes the consideration of benefits and costs, accessibility and consistency of regulations, and measuring and improving the results of regulatory requirements. The order reaffirms the principles established in Executive Order 12866 and directs each agency to use the best available techniques to quantify anticipated benefits and costs. It also emphasizes the importance of public participation in the regulatory process and encourages agencies to provide opportunities for public comment and online access to rulemaking dockets. The order encourages coordination, simplification, and harmonization of regulations across agencies and promotes flexible approaches that reduce burdens and maintain freedom of choice for the public. It also emphasizes the importance of scientific integrity in supporting regulatory actions. The order calls for the retrospective analysis of existing rules and requires each agency to develop a plan for periodically reviewing its significant regulations to determine if they should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed to improve the agency's regulatory program. The order contains general provisions and clarifies that it does not impair existing authorities or create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
