President Barack Obama has proclaimed December 2009 as Critical Infrastructure Protection Month. Critical infrastructure refers to assets, systems, and networks that are essential to the United States and whose incapacitation or destruction would have a significant negative impact on national security, economic security, public health, or safety. These can include water systems, power grids, computer networks, and cellular phone towers. The Department of Homeland Security is leading a national program to reduce risks and improve preparedness, response, and recovery in the event of an attack, natural disaster, or emergency. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) has been developed to establish a framework for securing and maintaining the resilience of resources during such events. The public and private sectors are encouraged to work with their appropriate authorities to engage in critical infrastructure protection activities. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of partnering to protect the nation's resources and calls for appropriate events and training to enhance national security and resilience.
