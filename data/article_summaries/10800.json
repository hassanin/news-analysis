President Barack Obama has issued an Executive Order terminating the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13396 of February 7, 2006, and revoking that Executive Order. The national emergency was declared in response to the situation in or in relation to Côte d'Ivoire, which involved the massacre of civilians, human rights abuses, political violence, and attacks against international peacekeeping forces. The President had previously addressed this threat by blocking the property and interests of certain individuals and implementing sanctions under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1572. However, the President has now determined that the situation in Côte d'Ivoire has significantly improved, citing progress in the stabilization of the country, successful conduct of the 2015 presidential election, progress in arms management, and combating of illicit trafficking of natural resources. With the termination of UN sanctions obligations and the advancements in Côte d'Ivoire, the President has concluded that there is no further need for the blocking of assets and other sanctions measures imposed by Executive Order 13396.
