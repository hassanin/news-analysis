They identified opportunities for collaboration in cybersecurity capacity-building, research and development, combatting cybercrime, international security, and Internet governance. The delegations also met with representatives from the private sector to discuss cybersecurity and the digital economy. The next round of the Cyber Dialogue will be held in Delhi in 2016.
