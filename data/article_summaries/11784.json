The article discusses a presidential memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on June 7, 2012, regarding the improvement of repayment options for federal student loan borrowers. The memorandum highlights the increasing number of individuals relying on student loans to finance college and the burden of student loan debt, especially for recent graduates. It mentions the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, which allows borrowers to cap their student loan payments at 15% of their current discretionary income. The memorandum acknowledges the need to increase awareness about repayment options and simplify the application process for IBR. It directs the Secretary of Education, in coordination with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to create a streamlined online application process for IBR by September 30, 2012. Additionally, the memorandum emphasizes the importance of providing integrated online and mobile resources for students to learn about federal student aid and repayment plans. It also calls for improved notification of the IBR plan to borrowers and the development of an online tool to help students make better financial decisions. The memorandum contains general provisions and clarifies that it does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits. The Secretary of Education is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
