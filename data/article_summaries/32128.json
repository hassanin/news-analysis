Olivia Imhoff, a rising senior studying Sustainable Development and Political Science at Appalachian State University, had the opportunity to work with Ivanka Trump as part of the Summer 2017 White House Internship Program. One event that stood out to her was Summer Reading at the National Museum of American History, where Ms. Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos read Rosie Revere, Engineer and engaged in hands-on activities with young girls to promote STEM education. Olivia worked with Ms. Trump's team to take pictures for social media, capturing memorable moments. She witnessed positive interactions between Ms. Trump and the girls, seeing firsthand how she inspired and encouraged them in various STEM-related projects. Olivia found it an honor and privilege to be a part of this event and has developed a strong work ethic and a desire to empower others through her experience with Ms. Trump.
