President Trump announced the issuance of a proposed new rule under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to overhaul the federal approval process for infrastructure projects. The goal of the proposed reforms is to reduce delays and streamline the process, allowing for faster completion of infrastructure projects. The proposed rule would establish a two-year time limit for Environmental Impact Statements and increase coordination among federal agencies to reduce delays. The reforms aim to maintain strong environmental protection while improving efficiency in the approval process.
