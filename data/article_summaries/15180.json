In this op-ed, First Lady Michelle Obama discusses the global crisis in girls' education. She highlights the fact that 62 million girls worldwide are not in school and are lacking basic skills needed to provide for themselves and their families. While investments in scholarships, safe transportation, and adequate school facilities are critical, they are not sufficient to address the broader cultural beliefs and practices that contribute to this crisis. Michelle Obama emphasizes the need to challenge societal views on menstruation, rape, and women's roles in order to truly solve the girls' education problem. She mentions her upcoming visit to the Middle East, where she plans to highlight the power of investments in girls' education and urge countries to make new investments and challenge laws and practices that harm women. Michelle Obama believes that cultural shifts and greater investments in girls' education can lead to positive ripple effects, such as lower rates of infant and maternal mortality, higher salaries for educated girls, and overall economic growth. She sees this issue as a moral one and vows to continue advocating for girls' education throughout her life.
