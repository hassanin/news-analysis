Today, new abortion bans are being implemented in Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas, which are seen as attacks on the fundamental rights of Americans. These bans are extreme and criminalize abortion, even in cases of rape or incest. Republican legislators are behind these near-total abortion bans, aiming to roll back the freedoms that have been in place for almost 50 years. These measures take away women's reproductive rights and allow politicians, rather than women and their doctors, to make personal healthcare decisions. This puts women's health and lives at risk. It is important for Americans to be aware that not only reproductive rights but also other fundamental rights, such as contraception and marriage equality, are in jeopardy. Congress should pass a law promptly to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade, and citizens across the country should make their voices heard.
