President Obama has announced a new competition to award over $200 million in public and private investment to create an Integrated Photonics Manufacturing Institute. This is part of the President's effort to highlight the need for continued investment in American manufacturing. The Department of Defense will lead this competition, which is the second of four new institute competitions to be launched this year. The President and his Cabinet will also be visiting manufacturers across the country on National Manufacturing Day to emphasize the importance of investing in American manufacturing. The Department of Commerce is releasing new resources to help manufacturers choose to locate in the United States, including a tool to evaluate and avoid the hidden costs of off-shoring. Additionally, the Department of Commerce and its partners are launching resources to help manufacturers quantify the advantages of locating in America. Finally, on National Manufacturing Day, over 1,600 manufacturers and affiliates will host tours and events to showcase careers and opportunities in modern manufacturing.
