Second Lady Karen Pence visited Ascension's Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas to learn more about the hospital's art therapy program. She observed an art therapy session with a six-year-old girl and toured the hospital's art gallery, where artwork created from art therapy sessions is displayed. Mrs. Pence also participated in a discussion with an art therapist and physicians about the importance of offering art therapy in hospitals. The art therapy program at Dell Children's serves an important role in the healing process for children, and Mrs. Pence is raising awareness about this program. Art therapy is an integrative mental health and human services profession that enriches the lives of individuals, families, and communities through active art-making. The program at Dell Children's began in 2007 and allows young patients to express their feelings through visual arts, providing coping skills and support for healing and understanding. Dell Children's is part of Ascension, the largest nonprofit health system in the US and the world's largest Catholic health system.
