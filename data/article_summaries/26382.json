The article discusses the Trump administration's approach to diplomacy with North Korea. The U.S. special envoy to North Korea, Stephen E. Biegun, reiterated the administration's objective of achieving the "final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea." The article compares this approach favorably to the Obama administration's approach towards Iran, which settled for a deal that did not demand an end to nuclear programs. The article also highlights that President Trump is committed to stricter terms in his talks with Kim Jong-un, signaling a departure from the Iran deal. The administration's actions and unified message suggest a different approach towards North Korea. The article emphasizes that the diplomacy between the U.S. and North Korea is personal, with negotiations being "top down" and based on commitments made between Trump and Kim. The Trump administration does not assume North Korea's eventual benevolence, unlike the Obama administration's assumption with Iran.
