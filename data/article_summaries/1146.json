President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued an order to effectively implement the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The Act aims to invest in the nation's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, rails, clean drinking water, high-speed internet access, addressing the climate crisis, advancing environmental justice, and investing in disadvantaged communities. The implementation of the Act will prioritize investing public dollars efficiently, increasing the competitiveness of the US economy, improving job opportunities with high labor standards, investing equitably, building resilient infrastructure, and coordinating with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. The order establishes the Infrastructure Implementation Task Force within the Executive Office of the President, which will coordinate the implementation of the Act and other related infrastructure programs. The Task Force will be co-chaired by the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council, and the White House Infrastructure Coordinator. It will consist of various members from executive departments, agencies, and offices. The order does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, and its implementation is subject to applicable law and available appropriations.
