President Biden has issued an executive order to form the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States. The commission will be composed of a bipartisan group of experts on the Court and the Court reform debate. The purpose of the commission is to analyze the arguments for and against Supreme Court reform, including the merits and legality of specific reform proposals. The commission will examine topics such as the Court's role in the Constitutional system, the length of service and turnover of justices, the size of the Court, and the Court's case selection and practices. The commission will hold public meetings to gather input from experts, groups, and individuals with diverse perspectives. The co-chairs of the commission are Bob Bauer, a former White House Counsel, and Cristina Rodriguez, a former Deputy Assistant Attorney General. The commission is expected to complete its report within 180 days of its first public meeting.
