President Biden will visit the Cummins Power Generation Facility in Fridley, Minnesota as part of his "Investing in America" tour. Cummins recently announced that it will start manufacturing electrolyzers in the United States, which help produce clean hydrogen and contribute to reducing emissions and creating jobs in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. The visit will showcase how Biden's agenda, which includes investments from various acts and plans, is building a clean energy economy, rebuilding infrastructure, bringing back supply chains, and creating well-paying jobs. Earlier in the week, Biden visited a semiconductor manufacturing facility in North Carolina and announced $435 billion in manufacturing investments by private companies since the start of his administration. The tour will continue with visits to over 20 states to highlight the impact of Biden's economic agenda. Additionally, the White House will host an Energy Communities Summit to emphasize the manufacturing and clean energy boom, job creation, and the return of clean energy supply chains to the United States.
