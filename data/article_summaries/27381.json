President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord. The decision is in line with Trump's promise to the American people during his campaign. Trump stated that the accord cost the U.S. economy nearly $3 trillion in reduced output, over 6 million industrial jobs, and over 3 million manufacturing jobs. He also mentioned that the accord imposes unrealistic targets on the U.S. for reducing carbon emissions, while giving countries like China a free pass until 2030. A study by NERA Consulting estimates that meeting the requirements of the accord would cost the U.S. economy nearly $3 trillion over the next few decades. Researchers at MIT have found that even if all member nations meet their obligations, the impact on the climate would be negligible, reducing global temperature rise by only 0.2 degrees Celsius in 2100.
