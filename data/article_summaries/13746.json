President Obama has nominated Judge Bernice Bouie Donald for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Judge Donald has over 28 years of judicial experience, including 15 years as a United States District Judge for the Western District of Tennessee. She was one of the first students to integrate Olive Branch High School in the 1960s and went on to graduate from Memphis State University and the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law. She has worked as a staff attorney at Memphis Area Legal Services and served as a judge on the Court of General Sessions in Shelby County, becoming the first female African-American judge in Tennessee's history. In 1988, she became the first female African-American federal bankruptcy judge in the nation. Judge Donald currently serves as the Secretary of the American Bar Association. President Obama praises her commitment to public service and believes she will serve with distinction on the Court of Appeals.
