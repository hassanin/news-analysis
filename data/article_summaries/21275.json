President Obama has signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which provides appropriations for the Department of Defense and Department of Energy national security programs. The Act includes provisions to counter cyber-attacks and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles by adversaries. However, the President expressed concerns about certain provisions, including the requirement to establish a unified combatant command for cyber operations forces and the prohibition on terminating the "dual-hat" arrangement for the Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and the Director of the National Security Agency. The President supports elevating CYBERCOM to a unified combatant command but believes the decision should be left to the executive branch. He also expressed concerns about the extensive organizational changes imposed on the Department of Defense, limitations on administrative leave for federal employees, and the failure to enact meaningful reforms to divest unneeded force structure and modernize military healthcare. The President is disappointed that the Congress has failed to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and believes it weakens national security. He also highlighted constitutional concerns with certain provisions, including those related to detainee transfers, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the removal of military officers, the establishment of a commission in the executive branch, and the determination of sanctionable human rights violations.
