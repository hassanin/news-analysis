This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama, revising the list of quarantinable communicable diseases. The order states that severe acute respiratory syndromes, which are capable of being transmitted from person to person and have the potential to cause a pandemic or high mortality or morbidity, are now included in the list. However, the order explicitly states that it does not apply to influenza. The order also includes general provisions stating that it does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
