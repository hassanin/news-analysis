The United States will host the Ninth Summit of the Americas in early Summer 2022. This summit, which has been held approximately once every three years since 1994, brings together leaders from all countries in North, South, and Central America and the Caribbean. It will be the first time the United States has hosted the summit since its inaugural meeting in Miami in 1994. More information will be provided at a later time.
