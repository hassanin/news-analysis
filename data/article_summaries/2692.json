On June 16, 2022, the President signed three laws into effect. The first, H.R. 1298, designates the United States Postal Service facility in Owasso, Oklahoma, as the Technical Sergeant Marshal Roberts Post Office Building. The second, S. 66, known as the "South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act of 2021," requires the Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia to create a plan to reduce and control harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in South Florida. The third law, S. 2201, the "Supply Chain Security Training Act," mandates the development of a training program for officials responsible for supply chain risk management at Federal agencies. The President expressed gratitude to the representatives and senators for their leadership in passing these laws.
