On Aviation Maintenance Technician Day, the US government recognizes the hardworking men and women who contribute to the safety and reliability of the aviation industry. They honor Charles Edward Taylor, known as the "Father of Aviation Maintenance," for his pioneering contributions to the building of engines for powered flight. The government is committed to expanding opportunities for technical careers and has released a five-year STEM education strategic plan and reauthorized the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. The National Council for the American Worker has also been established to promote apprenticeships and worker education. The government expresses gratitude to those who continue the legacy of aviation and vows to prioritize the next generation of technicians, mechanics, and engineers to maintain the US's leadership in aviation technology and industry.
