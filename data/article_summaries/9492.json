President Obama met with members of the Congressional Black Caucus to discuss the economy, job creation, and the need to pass health care reform. He acknowledged the progress made on the economy but expressed concern about long-term unemployment. The President requested specific recommendations from the Members regarding job creation. The meeting included discussions on the impact of the economy in economically distressed communities and the need for additional assistance in those areas. Participants agreed on several actions that could be taken to address unemployment, such as summer youth employment, job training tied to apprenticeships, reviewing Recovery Act contracting to ensure fair access to opportunities, and recognizing the job potential of weatherization programs and the passage of health care reform. The meeting concluded with Congressman Lewis calling for the passage of health care reform as a victory for the American people.
