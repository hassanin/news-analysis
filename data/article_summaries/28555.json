President Donald Trump has announced that he does not concur with the Secretary of Commerce's finding that uranium imports threaten the national security of the United States. However, he acknowledges that the domestic uranium industry faces challenges and has directed the establishment of a working group to develop recommendations for reviving and expanding domestic nuclear fuel production. The working group will submit a report within 90 days.
