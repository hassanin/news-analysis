In a memorandum to the Secretary of the Interior, Joseph R. Biden Jr. has directed the withdrawal of certain areas off the United States Arctic Coast of the Outer Continental Shelf from oil or gas leasing. This decision is based on principles of responsible public stewardship and takes into consideration the irreplaceable marine and coastal environments, including wildlife, wildlife habitat, scientific research, and Alaska Native subsistence use. The vulnerability of ecosystems and coastal communities to oil spills, as well as the need to address the consequences of climate change, are also taken into account. The withdrawal is in effect for an indefinite period and prohibits future oil or gas leasing for exploration, development, or production in the designated areas. Existing leases in these areas are not affected by the withdrawal.
