Second Lady Karen Pence recently visited Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in Ohio. During her visit, she met with families who have benefited from music and art therapy programs. Mrs. Pence also spoke with the staff involved in these therapies. She is a champion for art therapy and calls her initiative "Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART." Art therapy is a profession that uses active art-making and creative processes to enrich the lives of individuals, families, and communities. It is facilitated by professional art therapists who are experts in human development, psychology, and counseling theories.
