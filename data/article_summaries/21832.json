Vice President Biden and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius released a new report on seniors and health insurance reform. The report outlines how health insurance reform will benefit seniors and addresses key questions about President Obama's health insurance reform plan. The report emphasizes the importance of preserving and strengthening Medicare, cutting high prescription drug costs, making preventive services free, and ending overpayments to private insurance companies. It also states that health insurance reform will not burden seniors with out-of-pocket costs and that no money from the Medicare trust fund will be used to pay for reform.
