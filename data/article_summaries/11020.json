President Obama announced the launch of the President's Program for Better Parents and Mentors, which aims to promote responsible parenting and mentorship in order to build healthy families and communities. The program will continue efforts to reduce absentee fathers in the United States through partnerships with family service groups and parental counseling, as well as highlighting exemplary parents nationwide. The program includes community forums, outreach activities, and cultural-specific approaches to promote responsible parenting. Various organizations, including the National Parent Teacher Association and the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities, have joined to support the program. President Obama has also proposed a new Innovation Fund for Better Parents, Marriages, and Families to expand effective family and paternal responsibility programs nationwide. Additionally, the Department of Labor has provided funding for transitional employment programs for parents facing barriers to employment. Over the past year, government officials have engaged in conversations with parents and families across the country to understand the challenges they face. This includes discussions on the link between parenting and educational achievements, balancing family and work responsibilities, supporting military and veteran parents, and addressing parental issues within the criminal justice system.
