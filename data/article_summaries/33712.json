President Donald J. Trump recently signed an executive order focused on improving kidney health and increasing treatment options for American patients. The current quality of care for patients with kidney disease is deemed unacceptable, and treatment options are considered too costly. President Trump is taking an innovative approach to provide new treatment options for major diseases, refusing to accept the status quo. The goal is to ensure patients have choices and freedom in healthcare, with access to their preferred doctors, necessary treatments, and the highest standard of medical care worldwide.
