President Biden has announced his intention to nominate Chris Inglis as National Cyber Director and Jen Easterly as the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency. This move is seen as a step forward in strengthening the nation's cyber capability. If confirmed, Inglis and Easterly will join a team of experts, including Anne Neuberger, the first-ever Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, in protecting America's networks and addressing the challenges posed by adversaries in cyberspace.
