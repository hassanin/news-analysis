On June 15, 2012, the President signed two laws into effect. The first is S. 292, also known as the "Salmon Lake Land Selection Resolution Act," which ratifies an agreement between the Bering Straits Native Corporation and the State of Alaska regarding land adjacent to Salmon Lake in Alaska. The second law is S. 363, which allows the Department of Commerce to transfer specified real property currently under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to the City of Pascagoula, Mississippi.
