This memorandum reaffirms and supplements the principles established in the Presidential Memorandum of December 6, 2011, directing executive departments and agencies to promote and protect the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQI+) persons globally. The memorandum outlines specific actions to combat the criminalization of LGBTQI+ status or conduct abroad, protect vulnerable LGBTQI+ refugees and asylum seekers, advance nondiscrimination through foreign assistance programs, respond to human rights abuses against LGBTQI+ persons abroad, build coalitions with like-minded nations, and rescind inconsistent policies. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of treating all individuals with respect and dignity and asserts that the United States should lead in advocating for the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons worldwide.
