President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Maryland and authorized federal aid to help with recovery efforts after a snowstorm in February 2014. The federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and snow assistance in Baltimore, Carroll, and Howard Counties. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding statewide. Steven S. Ward has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made later if necessary.
