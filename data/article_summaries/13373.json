President Barack Obama has proclaimed June 2015 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Pride Month in the United States. In his proclamation, he acknowledges the progress that has been made in expanding civil rights and equal protections for the LGBT community, but also recognizes that discrimination and unfair treatment still exist. He highlights his administration's efforts to address these issues, including the implementation of protections against workplace discrimination for Federal contractors and the support for banning conversion therapy for minors. The President also emphasizes the importance of family acceptance for LGBTQ youth and the need to address homelessness and access to housing for the community. He mentions the update of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and the extension of benefits to legally married same-sex couples. Additionally, the President reaffirms the country's commitment to championing LGBT rights globally. He calls upon the people of the United States to eliminate prejudice and celebrate the diversity of the American people.
