On May 23, 2014, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 685, known as the "American Fighter Aces Congressional Gold Medal Act," awards a single congressional gold medal to the American Fighter Aces. This recognition is for their heroic military service and defense of the Nation's freedom throughout the history of aviation warfare. The second bill, H.R. 1209, awards a single congressional gold medal to the World War II members of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders. This award is for their outstanding heroism, valor, skill, and service to the United States in conducting the bombings of Tokyo.
