In a speech at the South Court Auditorium, President Biden discussed steps his administration is taking to improve air travel for Americans. He acknowledged the frustration many people have with the service provided by US airlines, especially after the government provided significant financial assistance during the pandemic. The President highlighted the progress made in holding airlines accountable for delays and cancellations. Many airlines now cover the cost of hotels, meals, and rebooking when they are at fault. Additionally, major airlines have eliminated fees for families to sit together and the Department of Transportation is proposing a rule to require airlines to display the full ticket price upfront, including all fees. The President also announced the launch of a new website, FlightsRight.gov, which provides transparency into airlines' compensation policies. Furthermore, he revealed that the administration will propose a new rule later this year to make it mandatory for airlines to compensate passengers with meals, hotels, transportation, and additional compensation in case of cancellations or delays caused by the airlines. The President emphasized the importance of these actions for middle-class families and called for further progress in lowering costs and holding corporations accountable.
