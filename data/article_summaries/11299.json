The White House released a statement expressing their disappointment with the House Republicans for passing an amendment sponsored by Representative Steve King. The amendment aimed to strip protections from "Dreamers," young individuals who were brought to the US as children and have grown up as productive members of society. The statement argues that the amendment goes against American values and treats Dreamers as if they were violent criminals, which is not reflective of who Americans are. The statement also asserts that the amendment will not become law.
