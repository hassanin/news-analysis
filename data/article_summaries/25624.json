President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in Puerto Rico and ordered Federal assistance to supplement recovery efforts after Hurricane Maria. Federal funding will be provided to affected individuals in multiple municipalities, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. The funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures throughout Puerto Rico. Alejandro DeLaCampa has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Damage assessments are still ongoing, and additional forms of assistance may be designated. Residents and business owners can apply for assistance online or by phone.
