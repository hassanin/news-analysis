The article discusses the importance of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and its impact on providing health care coverage for children. It mentions that before the creation of CHIP, 15 percent of children in the US were uninsured, but now only 4 percent lack health insurance due to the implementation of CHIP, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The article also highlights the efforts of the current administration to expand access to affordable health care and the positive outcomes achieved, such as one million children gaining health care coverage since the President took office. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is introduced as a legislative measure to further improve access to quality and affordable health care by extending ACA improvements, saving $800 on average in health insurance premiums for 13 million Americans, and preventing 3 million Americans from becoming uninsured. The article concludes by urging Congress to pass the IRA quickly to lower health care costs and increase accessibility for families and children across the country.
