In June 2017, the Russian military carried out a cyber-attack called "NotPetya," which caused extensive damage across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. This attack, considered the most destructive and costly in history, was aimed at destabilizing Ukraine and further highlights Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict. The attack caused billions of dollars in damage and will face international consequences for its reckless and indiscriminate nature.
