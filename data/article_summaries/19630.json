On March 13, 2013, the President signed into law H.R. 307, also known as the "Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013." This law reauthorizes appropriations through Fiscal Year 2018 and makes changes to improve public health and bioterrorism emergency planning, preparedness, and response. It also streamlines authorities within the Department of Health and Human Services to improve coordination and eliminate inefficiencies. Additionally, the law strengthens the role of the Food and Drug Administration to bring prevention and treatment products, called "countermeasures," to market for emergency use.
