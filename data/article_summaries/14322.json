The article discusses the importance of supporting the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) in order to secure Afghanistan and ensure its stability. The plan calls for the ANSF to reach a surge strength of 352,000 by the end of 2013 and maintain that size until the end of 2015. After that, there will be a gradual drawdown to an enduring force by the end of 2017. The international community and the Afghan government envision a future ANSF size of 228,500 with an estimated annual budget of $4.1 billion. The Afghan government has committed to providing at least $500 million per year for the ANSF starting in 2015, with other donors also providing significant additional funding. The goal is to ensure that Afghanistan can maintain its own security after the transition and prevent it from becoming a safe haven for threats to international peace and security.
