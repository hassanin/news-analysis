The President of the United States, Barack Obama, has submitted a tax treaty with Chile to the Senate for ratification. The treaty, signed in February 2010, aims to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income and capital between the two countries. It includes provisions to address "treaty shopping," which refers to the inappropriate use of a tax treaty by residents of a third country. The treaty also promotes the exchange of information between tax authorities in both countries to facilitate the administration of their respective tax laws. President Obama recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the treaty and provide its advice and consent for ratification.
