The authors of this op-ed argue that the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) methodology in assessing healthcare legislation is fundamentally flawed. They claim that the CBO's past predictions regarding healthcare legislation have not aligned with reality and that its upcoming analysis of the Senate bill to repeal and replace Obamacare will likely contain errors. The authors argue that the CBO's assumption that many states will expand Medicaid under Obamacare is highly unlikely and will result in inaccurate projections of people losing Medicaid coverage under the Senate bill. They contend that the American people and Congress should not place much weight on the CBO's predictions and that the CBO's estimates will be little more than fake news.
