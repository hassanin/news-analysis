The Biden-Harris Administration has announced the launch of the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, which is an income-driven repayment plan for student loans. The plan calculates payments based on a borrower's income and family size, and forgives remaining balances after a certain number of years. It aims to make college more affordable and reduce the burden of student loan debt. The plan will cut many borrowers' monthly payments to zero, save others around $1,000 per year, prevent balances from growing due to unpaid interest, and get more borrowers closer to forgiveness faster. The Department of Education estimates that over 20 million borrowers could benefit from the SAVE plan. The Department is also launching an outreach campaign to encourage borrowers to sign up for the plan and will contact nearly 30 million borrowers to invite them to apply. The campaign will focus on enrolling borrowers who will benefit the most from the plan but are often hardest to reach. The SAVE plan is part of broader efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to deliver relief to student loan borrowers and make college more affordable.
