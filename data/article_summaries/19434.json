This presidential memorandum, issued by Barack Obama on October 11, 2012, addresses the provision of U.S. drug interdiction assistance to the government of Brazil. The memorandum states that the interdiction of aircraft suspected to be involved in drug trafficking in Brazil's airspace is necessary due to the significant threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to the country's national security. It also emphasizes the importance of Brazil having appropriate procedures in place to prevent innocent loss of life during interdictions, including the ability to identify and warn aircraft before the use of force is employed. The Secretary of State is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register and inform Congress accordingly.
