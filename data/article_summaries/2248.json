Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at an event in Louisiana about the importance of high-speed broadband internet. She highlighted the significance of internet access in the 21st century and how it has become essential for everyday needs. Harris emphasized that many Americans lack access to high-speed internet due to affordability and availability issues, particularly in rural areas. She announced that the Biden administration is investing $277 million in grants to connect communities across the country, including $30 million for St. Landry Parish in Louisiana. Additionally, Harris mentioned the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which allocates $65 billion to expand and modernize broadband infrastructure. She stated that every household in America should have access to and be able to afford high-speed internet. The law also provides a discount on monthly internet bills for eligible households. Harris also discussed the administration's commitment to helping communities prepare for and recover from extreme weather, announcing $60 million for flood resilience, with $40 million allocated for Louisiana. She concluded by emphasizing the transformative impact of high-speed internet on communities and the administration's goal of providing equal opportunities for all Americans.
