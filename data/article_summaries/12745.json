The President has given authority to the Secretary of State to provide up to $45 million in defense articles and services, military education and training to Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria. This is to support their efforts in defeating Boko Haram. The assistance will include airlift support to help move troops and equipment to the border region where Boko Haram launches attacks. The United States will also continue to provide advisors, share information, and offer victim support and counter-violent extremism programming. Boko Haram has killed over 10,000 people since 2009, causing displacement and creating refugees in the Lake Chad Basin region. Defeating Boko Haram will require a comprehensive approach that combines human rights protection, development and governance progress, security measures, and civilian stabilization efforts. The United States is committed to standing with its regional partners to end Boko Haram's campaign of terror.
