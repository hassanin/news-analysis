The deal reached by President Biden and a group of Senators aims to make a significant investment in infrastructure and create well-paying union jobs. The plan includes repairing roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes, and building energy transmission lines. It also focuses on clean energy manufacturing and zero-emission vehicles, with the goal of ensuring that jobs in the clean energy industry are high-quality and American. Additionally, the deal requires that all taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects use materials made in America. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act aims to create jobs for workers in various areas, including rural areas, energy workers, historically disadvantaged workers, and distressed areas. The investment is expected to boost the economy, increase employment, and raise wages for workers nationwide. This legislation is part of President Biden's broader plan to support union jobs, which includes workforce development programs, investment in child care and long-term care, national paid family and medical leave, worker protection resources for federal agencies, and other initiatives.
