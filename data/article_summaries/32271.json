In honor of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the White House will be lit pink to raise awareness about breast cancer. First Lady Melania Trump encourages women to talk to their healthcare providers about mammograms and other methods of early detection. President Donald Trump stated that the nation stands in solidarity with those battling breast cancer and remembers those who have lost their lives to the disease. While deaths from breast cancer have decreased due to early detection and improved treatment options, there is still work to be done.
