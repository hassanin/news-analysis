President Joe Biden has proclaimed September 23, 2023, as National Public Lands Day in the United States. In his proclamation, he highlights the importance of public lands, including national parks, monuments, forests, and wildlife preserves, as irreplaceable and representative of the nation's natural wonders. He emphasizes the need to conserve these lands and waters for future generations, not only for their beauty but also for their historical significance, environmental benefits, and support of livelihoods. President Biden's administration has developed an ambitious land and water conservation agenda, including a goal to protect at least 30 percent of lands and waters by 2030. Investments have been made to address climate change, environmental justice, and wildfire risks. The administration has also designated new national monuments and restored protections for lands and waters across the country. To celebrate National Public Lands Day, fee-free access to national parks, forests, refuges, and grasslands has been announced. The proclamation encourages Americans to explore and care for the country's public lands through volunteering and conservation efforts.
