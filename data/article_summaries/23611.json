President Obama and President Karzai spoke for an hour via video teleconference to discuss the future of Afghanistan. They both expressed their commitment to working together to ensure stability in Afghanistan and to prevent it from becoming a safe haven for terrorists. They also discussed various topics, including security, governance, corruption, economic development, and regional relations. President Obama stressed the need for the Afghan National Security Forces to develop more rapidly so that Afghans can take greater responsibility for their country's security. He also emphasized that U.S. and international efforts in Afghanistan have a deadline of 18 to 24 months and must be evaluated based on measurable and achievable goals. Both presidents agreed to focus on improving services for the Afghan people, particularly at the local level, and to promote economic development and investment in agriculture, mining, water management, and energy.
