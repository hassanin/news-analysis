President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Nevada and has ordered Federal assistance to aid in the recovery efforts from severe winter storms, flooding, and mudslides that occurred from February 5 to February 22, 2017. This Federal funding will be available to State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Douglas, Elko, Humboldt, and Washoe, as well as the independent city of Carson City, are eligible for this assistance. Additionally, hazard mitigation measures statewide can also receive funding on a cost-sharing basis. Rosalyn L. Cole has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Further damage assessments may lead to additional designations in the future.
