President Trump delivered remarks in the Rose Garden on May 4, 2017, announcing that his first foreign trip as President of the United States would be to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Rome. He emphasized the importance of faith and tolerance in America, and announced that he would be signing an executive order to protect religious liberty and free speech. The executive order would prevent the Johnson Amendment from interfering with religious organizations' political speech and direct the Department of Justice to develop new rules to ensure religious protections for all Americans. The President also mentioned the abuses against religious freedom during the previous administration and vowed to put an end to them. He signed the executive order and proclaimed it as the National Day of Prayer.
