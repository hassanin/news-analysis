President Obama, along with Canada, the Republic of Korea, and the multilateral development banks, has launched a global framework for financing innovative SME finance models in developing countries. The framework includes the creation of the SME Finance Innovation Fund, which will provide grant funding for technical assistance, capacity building, and project development. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) will lead the fund's administration. The goal is to improve access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries, as they often struggle to secure funding from formal financial institutions. The G-20 SME Finance Challenge was launched to find the best models for catalyzing private SME finance, and 14 winners were announced. The United States, Canada, and the Republic of Korea are leading the effort to finance the Challenge winners, with contributions totaling $26 million. Additionally, other development banks and institutions have committed to providing financing as needed for these projects. Overall, a total of $528 million has been committed to support innovative SME finance models. The partners of the SME Finance Innovation Fund are calling on other G-20 governments, donors, and private investors to join the effort and contribute resources.
