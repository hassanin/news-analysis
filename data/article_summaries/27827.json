President Donald J. Trump is on the verge of fulfilling his promise to institute pro-growth economic policies that will provide financial relief to all Americans. The conference report on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowers tax rates, simplifies the tax code, and repeals the Obamacare individual mandate, is expected to promote economic competitiveness, raise wages, and grow the economy. President Trump commends the House and Senate conferees for reaching an agreement on the Act and is eager to deliver a tax cut to the American people by the end of the year.
