This article is a message from the White House Office of the Press Secretary regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. The National Emergencies Act stipulates that a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and transmits it to Congress stating that the emergency is to continue beyond its anniversary date. The President has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared in Executive Order 12170 on November 14, 1979, is to continue beyond November 14, 2011. The President cites that relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal and the process of implementing agreements with Iran from January 19, 1981, is still ongoing. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to Iran beyond November 14, 2011.
