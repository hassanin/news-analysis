This article is a presidential memorandum from June 2, 2014, addressing the influx of unaccompanied alien children (UAC) crossing the southwest border of the United States. The memo acknowledges the urgent humanitarian situation and directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish an interagency Unified Coordination Group to ensure a coordinated federal response. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator is designated as the Federal Coordinating Official to lead and coordinate federal response efforts. The memorandum emphasizes the need for unified efforts and cooperation among federal departments and agencies, while also stating that it does not impede their ability to carry out their responsibilities under the law. The memorandum does not obligate agencies to reimburse each other for resources used nor does it limit the use of the Economy Act. The memorandum is signed by President Barack Obama.
