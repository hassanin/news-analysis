The article discusses the Trump administration's plan to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and replace it with the Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE). The CPP, implemented by the previous administration, aimed to reduce carbon emissions from the power sector. However, critics argued that it exceeded the EPA's authority and would have raised electricity prices and cost jobs. The ACE rule, on the other hand, would restore states' authority and allow them to establish their own standards of performance. The article argues that the ACE rule will promote energy independence, economic growth, and job creation while ensuring environmental protection. It also highlights the progress made by the United States in reducing emissions and improving air quality. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of reliable and affordable energy for the country's prosperity and security.
