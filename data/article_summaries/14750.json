President Barack Obama issued a proclamation declaring December 7, 2011, as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. The proclamation honors the more than 3,500 Americans who were killed or wounded during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and pays tribute to the heroes whose courage ensured the nation's recovery from the attack. The proclamation encourages Americans to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and urges federal agencies and interested organizations to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff in honor of those who died at Pearl Harbor.
