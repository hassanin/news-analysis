President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring October 2019 as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The proclamation honors the courage and strength of the millions of Americans battling breast cancer and remembers those who have been affected by the disease. It highlights the statistics of breast cancer in the United States, with over 268,000 women and 2,600 men being diagnosed annually. While deaths from breast cancer have declined, it remains the second most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among American women. The proclamation encourages Americans, especially those at increased risk, to consult with their healthcare providers about the likelihood of developing breast cancer. Early detection and regular screening mammograms, followed by timely treatment, can greatly improve a patient's chances of survival. The administration is committed to supporting cutting-edge research and has eliminated regulations to facilitate the development of new drugs for breast cancer treatment. The proclamation also mentions the Federal "Right to Try" legislation, which provides greater access to lifesaving drugs for those diagnosed with terminal illnesses. It calls for increased awareness and encourages citizens, government agencies, businesses, organizations, media, and officials to join in the fight against breast cancer.
