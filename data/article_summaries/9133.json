President Biden is reconvening the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF) to address energy security, food security, and the climate crisis. The meeting will focus on raising ambition and joining new initiatives to tackle climate change while promoting energy and food security. The MEF includes major economies that account for 80% of global GDP and greenhouse gas emissions. Previous MEF meetings have contributed to progress in achieving climate goals, and this meeting will continue to accelerate climate action. Several countries are expected to announce new emission targets for 2030 under the Paris Agreement. The meeting will also discuss the Global Methane Pledge Energy Pathway, Clean Energy Technologies Demonstration Challenge, Collective 2030 Zero-Emission Vehicle Goal, Green Shipping Challenge, and Global Fertilizer Challenge. These initiatives aim to reduce methane emissions, invest in clean energy technologies, promote zero-emission vehicles, decarbonize ocean-based shipping, and strengthen food security through efficient fertilizer use. The United States is leading these efforts and providing financial support to facilitate their implementation.
