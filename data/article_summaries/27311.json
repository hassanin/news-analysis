A recent court ruling has once again challenged and weakened US immigration law. The law states that asylum is a discretionary benefit for individuals who have a genuine fear of persecution based on factors such as race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. This ruling is expected to further burden immigration courts with baseless cases, exacerbating the already massive backlog. It is also likely to encourage more illegal immigration, benefiting smuggling organizations that often exploit vulnerable women and children. This ruling is seen as an example of judicial activism that encourages migrants to take dangerous risks and empowers criminal organizations, while undermining US laws, borders, Constitution, and sovereignty. The government vows to continue fighting for the rule of law and against such reckless rulings.
