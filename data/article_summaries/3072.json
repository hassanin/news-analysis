In a press conference, President Biden discussed his six-point plan for the fall to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. He emphasized the importance of vaccination in controlling the virus and keeping the economy strong. The plan includes a requirement for all employers with 100 or more workers to ensure their workers are fully vaccinated or regularly tested. Additionally, nearly all healthcare workers will be required to get vaccinated, and patients seeking care at health facilities should be treated by vaccinated staff. These vaccination requirements will cover over 100 million workers. The President mentioned that more companies, including Fox News, are instituting vaccine mandates. He met with CEOs and presidents of various companies, including Disney, Microsoft, Walgreens, Columbia Sportswear, Kaiser Permanente, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Molly Moon's Ice Cream, who are leading the way in implementing vaccine mandates. The President also highlighted the positive impact of vaccinations on employment and the economy, as mentioned by Goldman Sachs and Moody's. When asked about General Milley, President Biden expressed his confidence in him.
