First Lady Michelle Obama will be joining FoodCorps leaders and local students to plant the White House Kitchen Garden for the sixth year in a row. The garden was initially planted in 2009 to start a conversation about the health and wellbeing of the nation, which led to the Let's Move! initiative. Since then, various individuals and organizations have worked together to improve the health of children across the country. This year, Mrs. Obama is inviting the founders of FoodCorps and six FoodCorps service members to join her in the garden planting. FoodCorps is a nationwide program that teaches children about healthy food and ensures they have access to it every day. The service members attending the garden planting come from various locations, including Connecticut, Michigan, Massachusetts, North Carolina, California, and New Jersey.
