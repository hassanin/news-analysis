On World AIDS Day, Ambassador Deborah L. Birx highlights the progress made in the global HIV/AIDS response. She mentions that for the first time in modern history, there is an opportunity to control the pandemic without a vaccine or cure. The United States, led by President Donald Trump, is working with various organizations and sectors to lead the way in the HIV/AIDS response. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has reached historic highs in preventing HIV infections and saving lives. Through refined approaches and cost-effective investments, PEPFAR has been able to have a significant impact. The program supports over 13.3 million people on antiretroviral treatment and has seen declines in new HIV diagnoses among adolescent girls and young women. The DREAMS partnership, a public-private initiative, not only prevents HIV but also empowers girls to be leaders. PEPFAR also supports orphans, vulnerable children, and their caregivers affected by HIV/AIDS. The program has also supported the birth of over 2.2 million HIV-negative babies to HIV-positive mothers. These achievements align with the PEPFAR Strategy for Accelerating HIV/AIDS Epidemic Control, which aims to control HIV epidemics in African countries. President Trump has committed his support to PEPFAR, emphasizing the importance of efficiency and impact. The article concludes by honoring those who lost their lives to AIDS and reaffirming the commitment to end AIDS as a public health threat.
