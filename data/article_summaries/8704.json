The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) was launched by President Biden in Tokyo, Japan, with twelve initial partners. These partners include Australia, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, representing 40% of the world's GDP. The goal of the framework is to strengthen ties in the Indo-Pacific region and promote technological innovation and global economic growth.

The IPEF aims to create a stronger and fairer economy for families, workers, and businesses in the United States and the Indo-Pacific region. It will enable the United States and its allies to establish rules of the road that ensure American workers, small businesses, and ranchers can compete in the region.

One of the key priorities of the framework is tackling inflation. By making supply chains more resilient, the IPEF aims to protect against disruptions that can lead to higher prices for consumers. The United States has a significant economic presence in the region, with foreign direct investment totaling over $969 billion in 2020 and trade supporting more than three million American jobs.

The Indo-Pacific region, with its 60% share of the world's population, is projected to be the largest contributor to global growth in the next 30 years. The success of the United States and its partners in the region will depend on harnessing innovation, particularly in clean energy, digital, and technology sectors, while addressing challenges such as fragile supply chains, corruption, and tax havens.

The IPEF will focus on four key pillars to deepen economic engagement in the region:
