In a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, President Barack Obama requested Congress to consider amendments to the Fiscal Year 2010 proposals in his Fiscal Year 2011 Budget. These amendments would allocate additional funds for various departments, including Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, State, and Treasury, as well as the United States Agency for International Development and the Broadcasting Board of Governors. The purpose of these amendments is to provide relief and support for Haiti following the devastating earthquake that occurred on January 12, 2010. The proposed amendments would increase the total budget for Fiscal Year 2010 by $2.8 billion. The President emphasized the urgent and essential nature of these needs and requested that the proposals be considered as emergency requirements.
