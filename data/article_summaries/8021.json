On September 5, 2023, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will award the Medal of Honor to Captain Larry L. Taylor, United States Army, for his conspicuous gallantry during the Vietnam War. On June 18, 1968, Taylor, then a First Lieutenant, was serving as a team leader of a helicopter light-fire team deployed in support of a long-range reconnaissance patrol that was surrounded by enemy forces. Taylor and his wingman arrived at the contact site and attacked the enemy using mini-guns and aerial rockets, despite intense ground fire. With both helicopters running low on ammunition and the enemy closing in, Taylor decided to extract the patrol team using his two-man Cobra helicopter, which had never been attempted before. He directed his wingman to provide covering fire while he landed his Cobra under heavy enemy fire to rescue the patrol team. Taylor's bravery, concern for his fellow soldiers, and disregard for his own safety reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army. Taylor was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and graduated from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He served as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and received multiple awards of the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who demonstrate exceptional gallantry and bravery at the risk of their own lives.
