President Trump met with several healthcare executives to discuss the negative effects of Obamacare and his plans to change it. He emphasized that Obamacare has caused premiums to increase and limited plan options for patients. He also mentioned that many insurers have stopped participating in Obamacare exchanges, leaving a third of US counties with only one insurer. Trump expressed his hope to work with the healthcare executives to stabilize the insurance markets and create a more competitive and affordable healthcare system. He also urged Democrats to stop obstructing and resisting reforms, such as expanded healthcare savings accounts and the ability to purchase insurance across state lines. The executives introduced themselves and their companies, and expressed their support for the president's efforts to stabilize the healthcare market.
