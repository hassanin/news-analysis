The passage of the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture Act is a cause for celebration in the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community. This act is seen as a step towards creating a physical space and a platform for these communities to be recognized as part of the American story. President Biden has emphasized that the diversity of cultures within these communities has contributed to the strength of the nation. The President is grateful to the leaders in the House and Senate for their efforts in passing this bill, and he looks forward to signing it into law.
