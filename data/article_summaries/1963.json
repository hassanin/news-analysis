On March 8, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signed an executive order establishing the White House Gender Policy Council. The council's purpose is to coordinate government efforts to advance gender equity and equality in both domestic and foreign policy. The council will work across executive departments and agencies to promote workplace diversity, fairness, and inclusion, and address issues such as systemic biases, economic security, caregiving needs, gender stereotypes in education, leadership, access to healthcare, gender-based violence, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women and girls. The council will also work towards gender equality globally through diplomacy, development, trade, and defense. The order outlines the composition of the council, the responsibilities of its members, and the development of a government-wide strategy to advance gender equity and equality. The order also terminates the working group created by a previous memorandum and provides definitions for "equity" and "underserved communities."
