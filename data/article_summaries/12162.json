The White House Council on Automotive Communities and Workers has announced a federal framework to speed up the cleanup and redevelopment of shuttered auto facilities resulting from the GM bankruptcy. The framework will invest over $800 million to put these facilities back into use, creating jobs and economic growth across the country. The framework will allocate funds for the cleanup of properties and to assist states and communities in dealing with challenges such as property taxes, demolition costs, and plant security. This effort is expected to be effective by the end of the year, making it the largest Trust ever created for the cleanup of debtor-owned property. The announcement was made at a conference on auto communities hosted by the White House Council. The Council also released its first Annual Report, which outlines the Administration's efforts to support the auto industry, workers, and affected communities.
