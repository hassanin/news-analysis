The United States commends the Czech Republic for hosting the Prague 5G Security Conference, which focused on the need for secure telecommunications networks as 5G technology becomes the new global system. Government officials from over 30 countries, along with representatives from the EU, NATO, and industry, discussed the national security, economic, and commercial considerations involved in evaluating 5G vendors. The conference highlighted the importance of securing supply chains for telecommunications networks and infrastructure, as well as the risks associated with vendors susceptible to third country influence. The United States supports the Prague Proposals on 5G security, which were published as a set of recommendations for nations to consider in constructing and administering their 5G infrastructure. The US government plans to use these proposals as a guide to ensure shared prosperity and security.
