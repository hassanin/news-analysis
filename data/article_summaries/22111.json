President Obama is planning to visit New Orleans to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. He will meet with the Mayor and residents, deliver remarks on the region's rebirth, and highlight the importance of working together to rebuild communities. The President will be joined by Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate, who has been instrumental in coordinating recovery efforts. Other members of the administration will also be visiting impacted areas and participating in commemoration events. Since taking office, the Obama Administration has focused on supporting the needs of survivors and rebuilding efforts by cutting red tape, investing in hard-hit communities, and ensuring that affected communities build back stronger and more resilient. The administration has partnered with Gulf Coast states to build back stronger and safer, invested in restoring the Gulf Coast economy and ecosystem, supported education and strengthened schools, rebuilt infrastructure, improved public health and community health care options, repaired and rebuilt homes, and strengthened access to public health and disaster aid for veterans. The administration has also worked on strengthening crime prevention efforts, creating a new model of federal-community partnerships, and investing in innovation and economic growth of the Gulf region and communities.
