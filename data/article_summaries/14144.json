In this article, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discusses the humanitarian aid being provided to Pakistan by the United States. She emphasizes the commitment of the US government to support Pakistan's fight against extremists while also addressing the major humanitarian crisis in the country. The US has provided over $100 million in humanitarian support, in addition to previous funding for Pakistan. The assistance includes supplies such as relief kits, tents, radios, and generators. Clinton also highlights the importance of investing in the people and economy of Pakistan, and mentions the coordination with UN agencies and NGOs. The US is deploying new tools, including a text-messaging system to alert local communities to assistance efforts. Americans can contribute by texting "swat" to a specific number to make a $5 donation. The US hopes that individuals who have fled the conflict will be able to return home safely, but assistance will continue as long as the crisis persists. Clinton also discusses the US role in assisting Haiti and the need for a partnership with Pakistan to address extremism.
