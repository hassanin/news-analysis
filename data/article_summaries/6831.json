The article discusses a letter written by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the Speaker of the House, detailing the targeted strikes conducted by United States forces in Syria and Iraq. The strikes were directed at facilities used by Iran-backed militia groups that have been carrying out attacks against US personnel and facilities in Iraq. These attacks, involving rockets and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have been escalating in recent months and have caused injuries to US and Coalition personnel. The strikes were carried out to protect the safety of US personnel, disrupt the ongoing attacks, and deter further aggression from Iran and its militia groups. President Biden asserts that the military action was consistent with his responsibility to protect US citizens and national security interests, as well as international law and the United Nations Charter. The President also emphasizes his commitment to keeping Congress fully informed and expresses his appreciation for their support.
