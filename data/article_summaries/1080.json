The American Rescue Plan, announced by President Biden, will provide $36 billion to the Central States Pension Fund, preventing significant cuts to the pensions of over 350,000 union workers and retirees. This program, known as the "Butch Lewis Act," aims to secure the pensions of distressed multiemployer pension plans, benefiting around 2 to 3 million workers and ensuring solvency through at least 2051. Prior to this plan, the Central States Pension Fund was the largest financially distressed multiemployer pension plan in the country, and without assistance, workers and retirees would have faced a 60% reduction in benefits. The American Rescue Plan's Special Financial Assistance program also provides relief to other struggling multiemployer pension plans, protecting the full benefits earned by millions of families. The program is administered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and aims to prevent the insolvency of the multiemployer pension insurance program, which was projected to occur in 2026 before the plan's implementation.
