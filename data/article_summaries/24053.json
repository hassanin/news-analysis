This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama on February 13, 2015, titled "Promoting Private Sector Cybersecurity Information Sharing." The order aims to address cyber threats to public health and safety, national security, and economic security by encouraging the sharing of information related to cybersecurity risks and incidents between private companies, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and other entities. The order emphasizes the importance of protecting privacy and civil liberties, business confidentiality, and the government's ability to detect and respond to cyber threats. It also establishes the formation of Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) and the ISAO Standards Organization (SO) to develop voluntary standards and guidelines for the creation and functioning of ISAOs. The order designates the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) as a critical infrastructure protection program and delegates authority to enter into voluntary agreements with ISAOs to promote critical infrastructure security. The order also includes provisions for privacy and civil liberties protections, updates the National Industrial Security Program, and provides definitions for key terms used in the order.
