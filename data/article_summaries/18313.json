President Obama has announced the creation of three new national monuments in order to protect significant outdoor spaces in the United States. The monuments are Berryessa Snow Mountain in California, Waco Mammoth in Texas, and Basin and Range in Nevada. These monuments will protect over one million acres of public land and provide economic benefits to local communities by attracting visitors. President Obama has now used the Antiquities Act to establish or expand 19 national monuments, protecting over 260 million acres of public lands and waters.
