This article discusses Executive Order 13586, which establishes an Emergency Board to investigate disputes between certain railroads represented by the National Carriers' Conference Committee of the National Railway Labor Conference and their employees represented by certain labor organizations. The order states that these disputes have not been resolved under the Railway Labor Act and are threatening to interrupt interstate commerce. The Board, composed of a chair and four members appointed by the President, will investigate and report on these disputes within 30 days. During this period, no changes can be made by the parties involved, unless agreed upon. The records of the Board will be maintained by the National Mediation Board. The Board will terminate upon the submission of its report.
