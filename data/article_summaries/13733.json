President Obama, Vice President Biden, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Dr. Jill Biden have launched a national initiative called Joining Forces to support and honor America's military families. The initiative aims to raise awareness about the service and sacrifice of military families and address their unique challenges and needs. It focuses on key priority areas such as employment, education, and wellness. Joining Forces involves various sectors of society, including citizens, businesses, non-profits, and government, to ensure that military families receive the support they deserve. The initiative builds upon President Obama's Presidential Study Directive released in January, which aims to improve the quality of life for military families. Joining Forces has also gathered commitments from leading employers, non-profits, and media companies to address military families' needs in employment, education, wellness, and public awareness. The initiative has launched a website called JoiningForces.gov, where people can express gratitude, find opportunities to get involved, and share stories of service. The Center for a New American Security will coordinate commitments and ongoing support for Joining Forces.
