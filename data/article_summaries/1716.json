President Joe Biden has proclaimed March 2021 as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month in the United States. In his statement, he emphasized the personal nature of the fight against cancer for many families, including his own and the Vice President's. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the country, claiming over 50,000 lives each year. Early detection is crucial in reducing the risk of death, and routine screenings can help save lives. Certain populations, such as communities of color and older adults, are at a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. Symptoms may include blood in the stool, stomach pain, and unexplained weight loss. Despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden urges Americans not to delay preventive care and screenings. The Affordable Care Act ensures that most health insurance plans cover preventive services, including colorectal cancer screening for adults aged 50 and older. The President also announced a Special Enrollment Period for the Health Insurance Marketplace to provide coverage for the uninsured. President Biden is committed to improving prevention and treatment for colorectal cancer and ending cancer as we know it. He encourages all Americans to talk to their family and friends about getting screened and join in activities that increase awareness and prevention of colorectal cancer.
