On April 6, 2017, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation declaring April 7, 2017, as "Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A." This day is meant to recognize the importance of education and the role of families, schools, and civic institutions in nurturing children's values and ambitions. The proclamation specifically highlights the efforts of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, known as the Lubavitcher Rebbe, in using values-based education to drive children towards achieving the American Dream. The proclamation emphasizes the need to support children in realizing their hopes and reaching their fullest potential. The President calls upon government officials, educators, volunteers, and all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
