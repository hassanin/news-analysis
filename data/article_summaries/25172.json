The President's Commission on White House Fellows has announced the appointment of the 2019-2020 class of White House Fellows. The Fellowship program was created in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson to give professionals from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to engage in public service for one year. The Fellows will serve in various roles in the Federal Government and participate in an education program that expands their knowledge of leadership, policy-making, and contemporary issues. The selection process is highly competitive and based on a record of professional accomplishment, leadership skills, growth potential, and a commitment to service. The Fellows will work full-time as paid fellows to senior White House Staff, Cabinet Secretaries, and other top-ranking government officials. Applications for the 2020-2021 Fellowship year will be accepted from November 1, 2019, to January 8, 2020.
