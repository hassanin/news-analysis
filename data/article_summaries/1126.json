The leaders of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (AUKUS) have reaffirmed their commitment to the partnership and a free and open Indo-Pacific. They condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and expressed their commitment to an international system that respects human rights, the rule of law, and peaceful dispute resolution. The leaders are pleased with the progress in Australia's program to establish a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability and are fully committed to sharing naval propulsion technology that strengthens the global non-proliferation regime. They also agreed to cooperate on hypersonics, counter-hypersonics, electronic warfare capabilities, and defense innovation. The leaders will seek opportunities to engage allies and close partners as they work on these and other critical defense and security capabilities.
