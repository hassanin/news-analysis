The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Biden, aims to address the climate crisis and create a stronger economy for working families. It includes historic investments in America's future, reduces healthcare and energy costs, and takes aggressive action to confront the climate crisis. The law will lower the deficit and require the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share of taxes. It also extends improvements to the Affordable Care Act, making health insurance more affordable for working families. Additionally, the act aims to make the tax code fairer and raise revenue for critical investments while ensuring that no family making less than $400,000 per year will see their taxes increase.
