The United States and Russia launched the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission (BPC) four years ago to promote cooperation and collaboration on various issues such as arms control, international security, defense ties, trade, counterterrorism, science, technology, and cultural ties. A joint report on the Commission's accomplishments since Spring 2012 has been submitted by Secretary of State John Kerry. President Obama encourages the working groups of the Commission to deepen their engagement with Russia to remove barriers to trade and investment, enhance security, and promote scientific and innovative advancements. The Commission aims to have a lasting impact by partnering with civil society and private enterprise.
