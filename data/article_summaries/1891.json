The President has announced plans to host a virtual Summit for Democracy in December, followed by an in-person Summit in approximately one year. The virtual Summit, scheduled for December 9 and 10, will focus on defending against authoritarianism, fighting corruption, and promoting respect for human rights. The President aims to galvanize commitments and initiatives from leaders across the world's democracies. After a year of consultation and action, a second Summit will be held to showcase progress made against these commitments. The Summits will bring together heads of state, civil society, philanthropy, and the private sector to foster international collaboration and address the challenges facing democracy.
