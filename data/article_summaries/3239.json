The U.S. and Mexican presidents have relaunched the U.S.-Mexico High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) to advance their shared economic and commercial priorities. The dialogue focuses on four pillars: Building Back Together, Promoting Sustainable Economic and Social Development in Southern Mexico and Central America, Securing the Tools for Future Prosperity, and Investing in Our People. The governments have engaged with stakeholders from civil society, the private sector, academia, and non-governmental organizations to inform their efforts. The collaboration aims to improve the regional business environment, deploy advanced technologies, strengthen supply chains, promote trade and travel, create jobs in Central America and southern Mexico, support regulatory compatibility, mitigate risks in technology and infrastructure sectors, and invest in entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized enterprises, and marginalized communities.
