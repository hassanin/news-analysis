On April 3, 2018, the President signed three laws. The first law, H.R. 3731, is called the "Secret Service Recruitment and Retention Act of 2018." This law extends the waiver that allows U.S. Secret Service employees to receive premium pay for performing protective services. The premium pay can be up to level II of the Executive Schedule and the waiver will now be in effect through 2018.

The second law, S. 2030, is called the "Ceiling Fan Energy Conservation Harmonization Act." This law harmonizes the compliance date for energy conservation standards for ceiling fan light kits and ceiling fan motors.

The third law, S. 2040, designates a facility of the United States Postal Service located at 621 Kansas Avenue in Atchison, Kansas, as the Amelia Earhart Post Office Building.
