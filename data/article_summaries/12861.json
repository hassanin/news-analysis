President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Indiana due to severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes that occurred from February 29 to March 3, 2012. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected area. The counties of Clark, Jefferson, Ripley, Scott, Warrick, and Washington are eligible for federal funding, which can include grants for temporary housing, home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other assistance programs. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Gregory W. Eaton has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations for assistance may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments. Residents and business owners who suffered losses in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will be available from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time, seven days a week until further notice.
