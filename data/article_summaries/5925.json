The President and his national security team are working closely with allies and partners to assess the situation. The US urges all countries to condemn these violations and encourages North Korea to engage in serious negotiations. While diplomacy is still an option, North Korea must stop its destabilizing actions and choose diplomatic engagement. The US is committed to ensuring the security of the American homeland, as well as its allies South Korea and Japan.
