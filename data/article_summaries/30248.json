First Lady Melania Trump traveled to Wyoming for a two-day visit to highlight some of the nation's National Parks and share the message of her initiative, BE BEST. She joined a group of Boy Scouts at Jackson Hole Town Square, where they discussed the relationship between the Boy Scouts and the National Elk Refuge. Mrs. Trump also visited the Veterans Memorial and went on a river rafting trip with fourth graders from the Teton County School district. The following day, she visited Teton National Park, where she distributed "Every Kid Outdoors" passes to second and fourth graders. The passes provide free access to national parks and waters. Mrs. Trump also observed an arrowhead presentation by visiting students and visited the Snake River Overlook. She expressed gratitude to the people of Wyoming and organizations like the Boy Scouts and the National Park Service for their efforts in protecting and taking care of national parks.
