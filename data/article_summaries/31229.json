Second Lady Karen Pence participated in a discussion with creative arts therapists in Jerusalem, including representatives from the Israeli association of creative and expressive therapies. The therapists work in various capacities, such as with children, Holocaust survivors, and Alzheimer's patients. Mrs. Pence expressed her appreciation for the critical role these therapists play in the healing process and commended their efforts in expanding the profession in Israel. Art therapy is a growing profession in Israel, with numerous art therapists working in health and education fields. Second Lady Pence has chosen art therapy as her initiative and calls it "Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART." Art therapy is an integrative mental health and human services profession that uses art-making and creative processes to enrich the lives of individuals, families, and communities. Professional art therapists with expertise in human development and counseling theories facilitate art therapy sessions.
