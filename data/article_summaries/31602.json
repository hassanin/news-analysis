The United States government has announced measures to combat international fentanyl trafficking and increase information sharing with the private sector to protect the country from this deadly drug. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released a series of advisories to help businesses better protect themselves and their supply chains from inadvertent fentanyl trafficking. The Department of the Treasury has also identified two Chinese nationals and a China-based Drug Trafficking Organization as significant foreign narcotics traffickers and designated one associate and a China-based entity as well. The goal of these actions is to curb the production and sale of illicit fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and other synthetic opioids. The advisories focus on manufacturing, marketing, movement, and money aspects of the trafficking of these drugs. The government aims to work with the private sector to stop the production, sale, and transport of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.
