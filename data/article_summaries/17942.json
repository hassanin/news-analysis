Vice President Joe Biden has announced nine new targets for the progress of the Recovery Act by the end of 2009. These targets include the funding of battery manufacturing plants for electric vehicles, construction and modernization projects at military hospitals, construction improvement work in national parks, providing small business assistance, enabling the purchase of fuel-efficient buses, providing housing loans and capital funding for households, funding renewable energy projects, and supporting highway projects. The Recovery Act, signed into law in February 2009, aims to create jobs and stimulate economic growth through tax relief, aid to families and governments, and funding for various projects. The Council of Economic Advisors estimates that the Recovery Act has created approximately 1 million jobs so far.
