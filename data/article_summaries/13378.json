President Obama is signing an Executive Order to cut waste and promote efficient spending across the federal government. The Order includes reducing spending on travel, limiting the number of information technology devices issued to employees, stopping unnecessary printing of documents, shrinking the executive fleet, and eliminating the purchase of promotional items. The goal is to reduce spending in these areas by 20 percent. This Order builds on the progress made through the Campaign to Cut Waste, which has already saved billions of dollars. The White House will also announce the finalists for the SAVE (Securing Americans Value and Efficiency) Award, which seeks ideas from federal employees to make government more effective and efficient. The finalists include ideas for creating a tool "lending library," reducing travel for property inspections, not purchasing U.S. Code books, and stopping the printing of a magazine. The Executive Order sets goals to reduce costs in areas such as travel, employee IT devices, printing, motor vehicles, and promotional handouts. Various agencies have already taken steps to reduce spending in these areas, such as utilizing teleconferencing, conducting audits of unused devices, increasing paperless transactions, and limiting the number of fleet drivers.
