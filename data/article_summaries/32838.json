This challenge is a global prize competition aimed at developing rapid and nonintrusive detection tools to find illicit opioids in international mail. The finalists will receive $100,000 in cash prizes and move on to Stage 2, where they will develop their plans into testable prototypes and compete for an additional $750,000 in cash prizes. The challenge aims to address the growing opioid crisis in the United States and prevent the entry of dangerous drugs through international mail.
