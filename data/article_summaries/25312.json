President Donald Trump recently had a conversation with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. During the call, Trump expressed concerns about the escalating violence in Afrin, Syria, and how it could undermine shared goals in the region. He urged Turkey to deescalate the situation, limit military actions, and avoid civilian casualties and the displacement of people. Trump also emphasized the need for caution to prevent conflict between Turkish and American forces. Both leaders agreed on the importance of defeating ISIS, and they welcomed the return of over 100,000 Syrian refugees to their country. Trump invited closer cooperation between the US and Turkey to address Turkey's security concerns. They discussed the necessity of stabilizing a unified Syria that does not pose a threat to its neighbors, including Turkey. Trump also expressed concerns about damaging and false rhetoric coming from Turkey, as well as the detention of US citizens and local employees during the prolonged state of emergency in Turkey. The two leaders pledged to improve the strategic partnership between their countries, particularly in promoting regional stability and combating terrorism, including ISIS, the PKK, al-Qa'ida, and Iranian-sponsored terrorism.
