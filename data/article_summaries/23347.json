This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama to establish the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. The task force is responsible for identifying ways to improve the partnership between law enforcement and local communities in order to reduce crime and increase trust. The task force is composed of up to eleven members appointed by the President, including individuals with experience in law enforcement, civil rights, and civil liberties. The task force's mission is to identify best practices and make recommendations to the President on how policing practices can promote effective crime reduction while building public trust. The task force will hold public meetings and engage with various officials and organizations to carry out its mission. The Director of the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services will serve as the Executive Director of the task force. The task force will submit a report to the President by March 2, 2015, and will terminate 30 days after the President requests a final report. The Department of Justice will provide administrative services and support to the task force. Members of the task force will serve without additional compensation but will be allowed travel expenses. The executive order does not affect the authority of other government entities, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
