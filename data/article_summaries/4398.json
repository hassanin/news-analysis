President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067 (Blocking Sudanese Government Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Sudan) to address the situation in Sudan, including the military's seizure of power in October 2021 and inter-service fighting in April 2023. The President aims to support a transition to democracy and a civilian transitional government in Sudan, protect it from those who would undermine it, and help meet the needs of the Sudanese people and prepare for democratic elections. The order blocks the property and interests in property of certain foreign individuals and entities involved in actions or policies that threaten Sudan's peace, security, or stability, obstruct its transition to democracy, undermine democratic processes or institutions, engage in censorship or corruption, commit serious human rights abuses, target civilians, obstruct United Nations missions or humanitarian assistance, or attack United Nations missions. The order also suspends the entry of noncitizens who meet certain criteria, except when their entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security will implement this authority. The order includes provisions for transactions and donations, and the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to carry out the order. The order does not affect the official business of the Federal Government or the United Nations, and does not revoke certain Sudan-related sanctions.
