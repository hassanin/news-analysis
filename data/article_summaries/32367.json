President Trump has signed the Great American Outdoors Act into law, prioritizing conservation and stewardship of public lands and national parks. The legislation provides up to $1.9 billion per year for five years to fund maintenance projects in national parks, including roads, trails, and buildings. It also permanently funds the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which supports recreational access, protection, and preservation of natural resources. The act aims to stimulate local businesses by attracting more visitors to national parks and wildlife reserves. The goal is to ensure that these national treasures can be enjoyed by future generations.
