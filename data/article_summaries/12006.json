The article discusses President Obama's proposals to build a 21st-century retirement system in the United States. The President aims to ensure universal access to workplace retirement savings accounts and make retirement benefits more portable for workers who change jobs frequently. The proposals include expanding access to workplace retirement savings opportunities, such as pooled 401(k) plans and IRAs, and providing tax credits for small businesses that offer retirement plans. The President also wants to expand retirement savings options for long-term, part-time workers and make it easier for workers without access to a workplace plan to save through automatic enrollment in IRAs. Additionally, the article mentions the Administration's efforts to increase the availability and use of IRAs, facilitate state-level retirement savings programs, and provide a simple, safe, and portable savings option called myRA. The President also emphasizes the need to make retirement benefits more portable by piloting new approaches, evaluating existing models, and enabling workers to consolidate their savings from previous retirement accounts into their new accounts. The article concludes by mentioning the steps taken by the Administration to promote rollovers between retirement plans, ensure retirement savers receive advice in their best interest, assist individuals in keeping track of retirement accounts terminated by their employer, and enable savers to access their retirement benefits even if their company goes bankrupt.
