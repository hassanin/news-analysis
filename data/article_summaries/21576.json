President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 2015 as National Wilderness Month in the United States. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of preserving the country's wilderness areas, which are part of a rich legacy that is passed down from one generation to the next. President Obama highlights his commitment to protecting these areas by designating more than 2 million new acres of wilderness during his time in office. He also mentions the Every Kid in a Park initiative, which provides free admission to public lands for fourth graders and their families. The President calls on Congress to fully and permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which has helped protect iconic places and facilitate outdoor activities for families. He also stresses the economic benefits and importance of these natural spaces in the face of climate change. President Obama invites all Americans to visit and enjoy wilderness areas, learn about their history, and contribute to their protection.
