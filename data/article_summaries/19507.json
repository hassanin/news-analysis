The article discusses the plans for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. The President announced that 34,000 troops will be withdrawn by next year, which will decrease the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan by half. Afghan forces will assume the lead across the country, while U.S. forces will continue to train and assist them. Discussions are ongoing with the Afghan government about post-2014 missions, including training Afghan forces and counter-terrorism operations. The security transition process aims to transfer full responsibility for Afghanistan's security to the Afghan National Security Forces by the end of 2014. The United States supports Afghan-led peace and reconciliation initiatives and encourages the Taliban to join a political process. The U.S. remains committed to a long-term strategic partnership with Afghanistan, and any future presence of U.S. forces will be at the invitation of the Afghan government. The U.S. will continue to assess the situation on the ground and negotiate a Bilateral Security Agreement. Funding will be sought to support the Afghan National Security Forces and promote Afghan governance and economic development.
