President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama send their warmest wishes to those celebrating Hanukkah. They reflect on the story of Hanukkah, where a group of believers rose up and freed their people, and how the oil that should have lasted for one night miraculously lasted for eight. This story has given hope to Jewish people for over 2,000 years. They encourage families and friends to come together to light the menorah and remember the blessings and sacrifices of their ancestors. They believe that through faith and determination, we can work together to create a brighter world for future generations. They end their statement by wishing the Jewish community around the world a happy Hanukkah.
