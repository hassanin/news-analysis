The article discusses a series of attacks carried out by Houthi militants in Yemen against United States military forces and commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden. These attacks have been ongoing since November 2023 and pose a threat to the safety of US forces and commercial ships, regional stability, and navigational rights. On January 9, 2024, the Houthi militants conducted their largest attack, targeting US and UK Navy vessels with multiple unmanned aerial systems, anti-ship cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. The United Nations Security Council has demanded that the Houthis cease all attacks. In response, on January 11, 2024, US forces, along with the UK and support from other countries, conducted strikes against Houthi facilities in Yemen involved in the attacks. These strikes were aimed at deterring and degrading the Houthi militants' capacity to carry out future attacks, while minimizing the risk of escalation and civilian casualties. The military action was carried out to protect US personnel and assets, degrade Houthi capabilities, and deter further attacks that could destabilize the region and threaten US strategic interests.
