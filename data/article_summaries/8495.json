Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, emphasizing the importance of space and the need for new rules and norms for its responsible use. She highlighted the threats posed by destructive missile tests in space, such as those conducted by Russia and China, which generate dangerous debris that can endanger satellites, astronauts, and commercial activities. As a result, the United States has committed to not conducting destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing and calls on other nations to join this commitment. Harris also mentioned the Artemis Accords, a set of principles guiding civil use of space, and the administration's efforts to establish a comprehensive set of norms for space activities. The speech emphasized the United States' commitment to lead in space and ensure a safe and sustainable environment for future generations.
