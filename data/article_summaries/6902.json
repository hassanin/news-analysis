President Joe Biden will be hosting a virtual leader-level meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF) on June 17, 2022. This will be his third such meeting since taking office. The aim of this meeting is to address the global climate crisis, rising costs exacerbated by Russia's war on Ukraine, and to ensure long-term energy and food security for the United States and its allies. President Biden has invited other countries to join the United States in concrete initiatives that will accelerate global action on climate change, energy security, and food security. The MEF includes countries representing 80 percent of global GDP, population, and greenhouse gas emissions, and other leaders critical to addressing the climate crisis have also been invited to participate.
