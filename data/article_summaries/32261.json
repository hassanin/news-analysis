On September 27, 2017, a group of Republican lawmakers known as the "Big Six" released a framework for tax reform. The framework is aimed at simplifying the tax code, reducing tax rates for individuals and businesses, and spurring economic growth. The plan includes lowering the corporate tax rate, reducing the number of individual tax brackets, and eliminating certain deductions and loopholes. The framework has received support from various members of Congress, advocacy groups, and business leaders, who see it as an opportunity to create jobs, increase wages, and make the U.S. more competitive globally. However, the framework is still in the early stages and will need to go through the legislative process before becoming law.
