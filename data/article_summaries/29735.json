President Donald Trump has returned a joint resolution, S.J. Res. 37, to the Senate without his approval. The resolution seeks to prohibit the issuance of export licenses for certain defense articles, defense services, and technical data to support the transfer of Paveway II kits to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United Kingdom, and France. Trump argues that the resolution would weaken America's global competitiveness and damage important relationships with allies. He believes that the licensing prohibitions in the resolution conflict with the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States, which include strengthening defense alliances and enhancing competitiveness in key markets. Trump also highlights the importance of protecting American citizens in Saudi Arabia from attacks by Houthi rebels supported by Iran, and the role of the UAE in the Saudi-led coalition. He argues that the resolution would degrade the UAE's military preparedness and its ability to protect its sovereignty. Additionally, Trump states that the UAE is a partner in combatting terrorism and a bulwark against Iran's malign activities in the region. The resolution would also have negative consequences for NATO allies and the transatlantic defense industry, potentially affecting defense procurement and interoperability. Trump further argues that the resolution would likely prolong the conflict in Yemen and increase civilian casualties by restricting the ability of partners to produce and purchase precision-guided munitions. He emphasizes the United States' commitment to minimizing civilian casualties and calls for efforts to achieve peace through a negotiated settlement in Yemen.
