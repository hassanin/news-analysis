On September 23, 2001, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency with regards to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism. This declaration was made in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania, and against the Pentagon. To address this threat, Executive Order 13224 was issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. On September 9, 2019, Executive Order 13886 was signed to strengthen and consolidate sanctions against international terrorism. The national emergency declared in 2001 has been extended for another year, as the actions of individuals involved in terrorism continue to pose a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This extension is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
