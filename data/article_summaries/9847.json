The National Clean Fleets Partnership is a public-private partnership aimed at reducing petroleum use in large commercial fleets. The Department of Energy (DOE) will assist companies in their efforts to reduce fuel use and achieve greater efficiency by offering specialized resources and technical expertise. Five charter members, including AT&T, FedEx, PepsiCo, UPS, and Verizon, have committed to reducing petroleum use through the deployment of over 20,000 advanced technology vehicles and displacing over 7 million gallons of petroleum annually. The DOE is encouraging other companies to join the partnership. Large commercial fleets offer significant opportunities to reduce fuel use and carbon pollution. The DOE will help companies reduce fuel use through the use of more efficient vehicles and technologies, as well as replacing conventional vehicles with advanced technology vehicles or ones that use alternative fuels. Partners will benefit from opportunities for collaboration with the DOE and their peers, as well as access to DOE technical tools and resources. This initiative compliments the Environmental Protection Agency's Smartway Transport partnership program with the freight industry.
