The article discusses the launch of the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research, which aims to close the research gaps in women's health that have persisted for a long time. The initiative was prompted by the need to address conditions that predominantly or exclusively affect women, such as debilitating migraines and undiagnosed heart attacks. Research on women's health has been underfunded for decades, and communities that have historically been excluded from research, including women of color and women with disabilities, face even greater gaps in understanding and treatment options. President Biden issued a memorandum asking federal agencies to review their programs and make necessary policy changes to advance women's health research. Dr. Carolyn Mazure, a renowned women's health researcher, has been appointed to lead this effort. The article emphasizes the importance of investing in women's health and the need to start addressing these issues immediately. Secretary Becerra is also mentioned as a partner in this work.
