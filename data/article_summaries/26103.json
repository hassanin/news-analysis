President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Illinois and ordered federal assistance to support recovery efforts in areas affected by severe storms and flooding from February 24 to July 3, 2019. The federal funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive funding on a cost-sharing basis. Ms. Nancy Casper has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and justified by further damage assessments. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
