In this article, President Obama delivers remarks at the Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner. He begins by joking about the opportunity to tell jokes that weren't funny enough for a previous event. He mentions a trip to Egypt where pictures of Rahm on a camel were taken, and expresses his nervousness about the situation. 

The President then shifts his focus to the work being done back home, particularly in repairing financial institutions and auto companies. He makes a sarcastic comment about radio and television correspondents not understanding the concept of troubled industries.

Another issue he addresses is the high cost of healthcare in America. He mentions gaining support from the American Medical Association in his efforts to reform the healthcare system. He concludes with a humorously exaggerated statement about catching flies with honey or using a swift downward wrist motion if necessary.
