In this op-ed, Vice President Joe Biden discusses the recent agreement on a framework for a new government in Iraq. He emphasizes the importance of a government that includes all major political parties and does not exclude or marginalize anyone. Biden commends the progress that Iraq has made in using politics as a means to settle differences and advance interests, rather than resorting to violence. He highlights the need for Iraq's new government to honor their commitment to power-sharing and emphasizes the United States' continued engagement in Iraq, albeit in a civilian-led capacity. Biden acknowledges the challenges that Iraq still faces in terms of security and prosperity and emphasizes the importance of developing Iraq's security forces. He also mentions various challenges that lie ahead for Iraq's leaders, such as conducting a census, integrating Kurdish security forces, resolving internal boundaries, passing a hydrocarbon law, stabilizing the economy, and fulfilling post-Gulf war obligations to the United Nations. Biden argues that while Iraq's natural wealth will eventually be able to finance its own needs, it still requires support from the United States. He requests Congress to fulfill budget requests for continued engagement in Iraq. Biden concludes by stating that it is in America's fundamental interest to help preserve Iraq's progress and prevent the re-emergence of violent extremists, as well as encourage Iraq to become a pivotal ally in the region.
