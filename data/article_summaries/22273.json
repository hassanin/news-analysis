In this statement, the President acknowledges the progress made in reducing reliance on foreign oil and expanding American-made energy. The report highlights a decrease in imports of foreign oil by a million barrels per day in the past year. The administration's focus on increasing domestic oil and gas production and implementing fuel economy standards has helped reduce vulnerability to global oil market fluctuations. Progress has also been made in expanding clean energy, such as wind and solar power, with the expectation of doubling renewable energy sources. The construction of advanced biofuel refineries is also underway. However, the President acknowledges that high gas prices serve as a reminder that more work needs to be done to free the nation from dependence on foreign oil. The administration remains committed to taking control of the country's energy future in the coming months.
