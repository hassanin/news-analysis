In this article, it is stated that President Obama made separate calls to Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Harry Reid. He reiterated the need to extend the payroll tax cut for the entire year and emphasized that the short-term bipartisan compromise passed by the Senate is the only option to prevent a tax hike for middle-class families. The President urged Speaker Boehner to take up the bipartisan compromise that would prevent 160 million working Americans from facing a tax increase on January 1st. He also spoke with Leader Reid, applauding him for his work in achieving a successful bipartisan compromise in the Senate. Senator Reid reaffirmed his commitment to securing a bipartisan year-long tax cut after the House passes the two-month extension. The President urged Speaker Boehner to allow a vote on the compromise that both Democrats and Republicans passed together in order to provide the American people with assurance during the holiday season that they will not see a significant tax hike in just 10 days.
