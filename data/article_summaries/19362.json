President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 2, 2013, as a National Day of Prayer in the United States. In the proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of prayer as a way for Americans to come together, find strength, and support one another in both good times and bad. He acknowledges that prayer is a means of uniting, guiding, and healing, and that it provides reassurance, sustenance, and affirmation of common purpose. The President calls on Americans of all religions and creeds to reflect on the sacredness of life and express sympathy for those affected by recent events such as the Boston Marathon bombings, the Newtown shootings, and the explosion in West, Texas. He also asks for prayers for the safety and well-being of first responders, military personnel, and their families. The President concludes by giving thanks for the freedom to practice faith and asking for continued guidance, mercy, and protection.
