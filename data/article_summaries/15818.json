On November 12, 2009, the White House released a notice stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. This national emergency was declared on November 14, 1979, by President Carter, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat posed by the situation in Iran to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The emergency is being extended because relations with Iran have not yet normalized and the process of implementing agreements with Iran is still ongoing. The national emergency will continue for one more year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
