The article discusses the continuation of a national emergency declaration with respect to Cuba. The national emergency was initially declared in 1996 following the destruction of two US civilian aircraft by the Cuban government. Over the years, the emergency has been modified and expanded to address disturbances in international relations caused by the Cuban government. The article states that the Cuban government has not shown a willingness to refrain from using excessive force against US vessels or aircraft engaged in memorial activities or peaceful protests near Cuba. Additionally, unauthorized entry of US-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is seen as detrimental to US foreign policy due to the potential for mass migration from Cuba, which could pose a threat to US national security and international relations. As a result, the national emergency declaration and emergency authority regarding the regulation of vessel movement are continued. The notice of this continuation will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress. The article is signed by Joseph R. Biden Jr., the President of the United States, and is dated February 23, 2022.
