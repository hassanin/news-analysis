Vice President Joe Biden has announced the finalization of a $535 million loan guarantee for Solyndra, a company that manufactures cylindrical solar photovoltaic panels. The funding will support the construction of the company's new manufacturing facility, which is expected to create 3,000 construction jobs and up to 1,000 permanent jobs. The facility will produce solar panels that can power 24,000 homes annually. The investment is part of the government's efforts to promote renewable energy and create jobs in the clean energy sector. Solyndra's panels will be used in the market for large, flat rooftops. This loan guarantee is the first issued by the Department of Energy since the 1980s.
