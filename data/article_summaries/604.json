National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has traveled to Seoul, Republic of Korea (ROK) for meetings with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea. The discussions have focused on strengthening the trilateral relationship, including cooperation on emerging threats such as weapons transfers between North Korea and Russia. They have also discussed aligning their respective Indo-Pacific Strategies. The meetings build upon the progress made during the Camp David Trilateral Summit in August. In addition, Sullivan is participating in the inaugural Next Generation Critical and Emerging Technology (CET) Dialogue between the U.S. and South Korea, which aims to deepen collaboration on critical and emerging technology, including clean energy. The CET Dialogue will focus on six main technology areas, including semiconductor supply chains, biotechnology, clean energy, quantum, digital connectivity, and artificial intelligence. Sullivan will also reaffirm the United States' support for South Korea and Japan in the face of North Korea's provocative actions and discuss collaboration on key issues such as critical and emerging technology, economic resilience, and development assistance.
