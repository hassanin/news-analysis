Vice President Kamala Harris spoke with Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar. She thanked him for his efforts in securing a deal between Israel and Hamas that resulted in a pause in the fighting and the release of over 100 hostages, including Americans. However, the pause was violated by Hamas. Harris expressed the United States' commitment to working with Qatar and other regional partners to release all hostages and provide humanitarian aid. They also discussed planning for the future in Gaza after the fighting ends.
