The article discusses an upcoming announcement by President Biden, Vice President Harris, and former President Obama regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Department of the Treasury will release a proposed rule aimed at strengthening the ACA. Currently, family members who have access to affordable coverage through a family member's job are not eligible for financial help under the ACA, even if the cost of that coverage is high. The proposed rule will change this, allowing family members who have to pay more than 10 percent of their income for coverage to receive financial assistance. This change is expected to help 200,000 uninsured people gain coverage and lower premiums for nearly a million more. The article also highlights the progress made in increasing healthcare coverage under the ACA, including a successful open enrollment period and the expansion of Medicaid in certain states. Additionally, the President will sign an executive order directing agencies to continue efforts to make coverage more affordable and accessible. The executive order will address areas such as expanding Medicaid, protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and improving access to healthcare in underserved communities.
