The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a fact sheet discussing the Administration's Fiscal Year 2015 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) request. The request includes funding for the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan and the Department of Defense's supporting presence in the broader region. The request reflects a continued decrease in war-related spending and fully supports the Administration's plan for Afghanistan. It includes funding for the U.S. advisory and counterterrorism mission, support for NATO allies in Afghanistan, and continued assistance to the Afghan National Security Forces. The OCO funding will also support a significant portion of the military presence in the region, enabling DOD to support missions in Afghanistan and other important missions. The fact sheet also introduces the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF), which the President will request Congress to support. The CTPF will provide resources to respond to emerging terrorist threats globally and will focus on empowering and enabling partners to combat terrorism. The Administration will seek up to $5 billion in the FY 2015 OCO request to support these counterterrorism efforts. This fund will allow DOD to conduct expanded train and equip activities, facilitate and enable partners' counterterrorism efforts, and provide security, stabilization, and support against violent extremism and terrorist ideology.
