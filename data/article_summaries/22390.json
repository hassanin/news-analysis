The article discusses the High Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program in California. The state has made significant investments in passenger rail, leading to a growth in ridership. Funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act will be used to construct a new high-speed rail system connecting major cities in California. The first phase will connect Anaheim and Los Angeles to San Francisco by 2020, with trains reaching speeds of 220mph. The projected annual ridership for Phase I is between 35 and 58 million passengers, with the expectation of up to 100 million passengers per year at full build-out. The existing intercity passenger rail routes in California will also be enhanced to connect to the new high-speed service. The article provides a summary of the investments in each corridor, including purchasing right-of-way, constructing track and stations, and upgrading existing infrastructure to improve travel times and reduce pollution.
