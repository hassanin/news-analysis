Vice President Kamala Harris is set to travel to Singapore and Vietnam next month in order to strengthen relationships and expand economic cooperation with these two important partners in the Indo-Pacific region. The trip will involve engaging with the leaders of both governments on various topics such as regional security, the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and efforts to promote a rules-based international order. Additionally, the visit will celebrate the cultural and people-to-people ties between the United States and these countries. This visit is part of President Biden and Vice President Harris' efforts to rebuild global partnerships and ensure national security, with a particular focus on deepening engagement in Southeast Asia. Notably, this will be the first time a Vice President visits Vietnam.
