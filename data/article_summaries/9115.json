The Biden-Harris Administration has announced an investment of over $100 million to renovate homes with zero energy and climate resilient technology. This is part of their goal to cut the cost of decarbonizing housing by 50% within a decade, while also reducing energy bills and increasing affordable housing supply. The buildings sector in the United States accounts for over a third of greenhouse gas emissions, with 20% coming from heating, cooling, and operating homes. By investing in solutions to reduce pollution from homes, the US aims to curb 37% of greenhouse gas emissions related to operating, constructing, and renovating buildings. The investment from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will support the renovation of over 1,500 low-income family homes to be zero energy and climate resilient. These renovations will showcase the potential to lower energy waste, increase resilience to extreme weather events, and lower costs for families. The investments align with President Biden's Justice40 Initiative and the administration's commitment to environmental justice. Additionally, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Energy have opened applications for the Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit program, which will encourage clean energy investments in underserved communities. This program provides a tax credit boost for small solar and wind projects in low-income or Tribal communities. These announcements are part of the administration's efforts to enhance climate resilience in buildings, lower home energy costs, increase housing supply, and promote fair housing.
