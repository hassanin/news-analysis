This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on September 22, 2020, aims to combat what the administration sees as offensive and anti-American race and sex stereotyping and scapegoating. The order asserts that there is a vision of America grounded in hierarchies based on collective social and political identities, which is contrary to the belief in the inherent equality of every individual. The order states that this ideology is migrating from the fringes of American society and is now infecting core institutions. It points to instances of race and sex stereotyping and scapegoating in workplace diversity trainings, federal entities, and educational materials. The order declares that federal departments and agencies, uniformed services, federal contractors, and federal grant recipients should not promote race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating. It defines divisive concepts and sets requirements for the United States Uniformed Services, government contractors, federal grants, and agencies. The order also calls for a review of agency training programs and provides guidance on Title VII compliance.
