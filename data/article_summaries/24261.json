President Obama has declared a major disaster for the Navajo Nation, providing federal aid to supplement the Tribe's efforts in the area affected by a severe freeze from December 15, 2012, to January 21, 2013. The declaration allows for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the freeze, and hazard mitigation measures. Mark A. Neveau has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the Tribe and warranted by further damage assessments.
