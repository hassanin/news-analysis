The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a message from President Barack Obama to the Senate regarding the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing. The President transmitted the agreement to the Senate for ratification and also provided the Department of State's report on the agreement. The agreement establishes legally binding minimum standards for port states to control access by foreign fishing vessels, as well as foreign transport and supply ships that support fishing vessels. It also encourages parties to apply similar measures to their own vessels. The agreement aims to prevent fish from illegal, unreported, and unregulated fisheries from entering the stream of commerce. The President recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the agreement and provide its advice and consent for ratification. The necessary legislation to implement the agreement will be submitted separately to Congress.
