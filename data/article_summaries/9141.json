The White House has announced the launch of the first-ever White House Initiative on Women's Health Research. This initiative aims to address the research gaps in women's health and improve the understanding and treatment of conditions that primarily or exclusively affect women. Historically, women's health research has been underfunded, leading to limited knowledge about conditions like endometriosis and autoimmune diseases. The initiative will be led by Dr. Carolyn Mazure, a renowned women's health researcher, with the support of Jen Klein, Director of the Gender Policy Council. Maria Shriver, a women's health advocate, played a crucial role in bringing attention to this issue.
