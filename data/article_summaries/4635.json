The United States is proud to be the largest single donor of humanitarian, democracy, and human rights assistance to Ukraine. They are committed to providing aid to those affected by Russia's war of aggression, particularly vulnerable populations such as women, children, LGBTQI+ individuals, and persons with disabilities. The US is also supporting Ukraine's neighbors and the European Union in hosting refugees. They are prepared to offer over $1 billion in new funding for humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter, clean water, and medical supplies. Additionally, they will provide $320 million in democracy and human rights funding to Ukraine and its neighbors. Since 2021, the US has already provided over $1.1 billion in assistance to the Europe and Eurasia region. They are also supporting public health initiatives to combat diseases like polio, tuberculosis, and COVID-19, and are committed to defending democratic governance, human rights, and fighting corruption in Ukraine and its neighbors.
