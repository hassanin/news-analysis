President Donald Trump has modified the boundaries of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, reducing its size by approximately 85%. The original monument, established by President Barack Obama in 2016, covered 1.35 million acres of federal land and was managed jointly by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service. The modified monument will consist of two smaller areas known as the Indian Creek and Shash JÃ¡a units, totaling approximately 201,876 acres. The decision to reduce the monument's size was based on the belief that many of the objects of historic or scientific interest within the monument are already protected by existing laws and land-use plans. The modified monument is intended to preserve the area's cultural, scientific, and historic legacy.
