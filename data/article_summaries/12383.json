The United States is committed to improving citizen security in Central America through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) and other complementary investments. The U.S. supports the region's governments in creating safer streets, strengthening the rule of law, and protecting human rights. The priorities for U.S. cooperation include direct support to reduce and prevent crime, federal law enforcement cooperation, investments in drug demand reduction and gang prevention, maritime and air interdiction, and international donor coordination. Through CARSI, the U.S. has contributed $496 million from 2008 to 2012 and has requested $161.5 million for FY 2014. U.S. assistance also focuses on reducing the vulnerability of communities to crime, strengthening the rule of law, and promoting economic development. Extensive law enforcement cooperation is established between the U.S. and Central American countries to combat transnational criminal threats. The U.S. implements domestic programs to target criminal networks that undermine citizen security in Central America, such as the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program and local task forces. The U.S. also focuses on reducing domestic drug consumption and has spent over $31 billion on domestic demand reduction in the last three years. Maritime and air interdiction efforts are in place to disrupt criminal activity in coastal waters. International partnership is crucial in combating security threats in Central America, and the Group of Friends of Central America works with the seven countries of Central America to implement the Central America Security Strategy.
