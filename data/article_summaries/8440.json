On December 19, 2023, the President signed several bills into law. One of them is H.R. 1734, also known as the "TRANQ Research Act of 2023." This law requires the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology to support research on identifying xylazine, novel synthetic opioids, and other new psychoactive substances.

Another bill that was signed into law is S. 788, the "Duck Stamp Modernization Act of 2023." This law allows the use of electronic Federal duck stamps instead of physical stamps for migratory water hunter licensing requirements.

The President also signed S. 2747, which extends the authority of the Federal Election Commission to impose civil monetary penalties for violations of disclosure requirements for ten more years, until December 31, 2033.

Lastly, S. 2787, also known as the "5G SALE Act," authorizes the Federal Communications Commission to process applications for licenses for the use of spectrum between 2496 megahertz and 2690 megahertz from applicants selected through competitive bidding before March 9, 2023.

The President expressed gratitude to the representatives and senators who showed leadership in these bills' development and passage.
