The United States and the African Union (AU) - Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) have renewed their partnership by signing an updated Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC). The memorandum outlines shared priorities for a safer, healthier, and more equitable future, and signifies a continued and expanded commitment to the partnership. The AU recently elevated Africa CDC's status to an autonomous health agency, recognizing its leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic and other health events. Since 2015, the US government and Africa CDC have worked together to combat crises such as Ebola and COVID-19 through technical assistance, embedded experts, funding, and more. The partnership will focus on areas including National Public Health Institutes (NPHIs), public health workforce development, COVID-19 response, critical medical commodities, and advanced molecular detection.
