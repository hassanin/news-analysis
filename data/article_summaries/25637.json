President Donald J. Trump will award the Medal of Honor to retired United States Army Captain Gary M. Rose for his bravery during the Vietnam War. Captain Rose, who served as a medic with the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), risked his life multiple times to provide medical aid to his comrades. He shielded a wounded American with his own body and exposed himself to enemy fire to move wounded personnel to safety. Despite being wounded himself, he pulled the helicopter crew and members of his unit from a burning helicopter wreckage and provided medical aid until help arrived. Captain Rose enlisted in the Army after attending San Fernando State College and retired in 1987. He now lives in Huntsville, Alabama, with his wife and is involved in various charitable organizations. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who display exceptional bravery and self-sacrifice in the face of great risk. The award ceremony will take place at the White House, and details about media credentials will be released at a later date.
