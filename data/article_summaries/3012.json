The White House has announced that John D. Porcari will serve as the Port Envoy to the Biden-Harris Administration Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force. The Task Force was established to address supply and demand mismatches that emerged in various sectors following the economic recovery efforts and vaccination campaigns. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg leads the Task Force's focus on ports and trucking issues, with other leaders including Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Porcari will work closely with Secretary Buttigieg and the Department of Transportation to tackle congestion at U.S. ports. The congestion is particularly acute at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, leading to delivery delays and product shortages for American consumers and businesses. The Biden Administration has also negotiated $17 billion in investments in port infrastructure as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal to address congestion and supply chain issues. Porcari has a background in infrastructure leadership and has previously overseen port and maritime policies and projects at the federal and state levels.
