The U.S.-Mexico 21st Century Border Management Executive Steering Committee (ESC) met to discuss creating a border that promotes economic competitiveness and enhances security. They approved a report summarizing actions completed in 2012 and adopted action items for 2013. The governments of the United States and Mexico committed to fundamentally restructuring the way they manage their shared border to increase economic competitiveness, enhance public safety, and promote economic development. The ESC will work in three areas: infrastructure, secure flows, and law enforcement and security cooperation. They will focus on coordinated infrastructure planning, expanding trusted traveler and shipper programs, reducing border wait times, and implementing technology for entry/exit data exchange. They also discussed securing the borders and dismantling criminal networks involved in trafficking. Stakeholder input will be sought through outreach efforts.
