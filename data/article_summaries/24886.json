President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring November 9, 2012, as World Freedom Day. The proclamation highlights the importance of ordinary citizens sparking movements for change and commemorates the collapse of the Iron Curtain. The proclamation also acknowledges that while progress has been made in terms of freedom and human rights, there are still many people around the world who are denied fundamental liberties. The United States, as a country founded on the belief in self-governance, is called upon to stand with those who are fighting for their rights. The proclamation concludes by urging the people of the United States to observe World Freedom Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming their dedication to freedom and democracy.
