On World Humanitarian Day, we remember and honor the sacrifices made by humanitarian aid workers around the world. This year, the world faces an unprecedented level of humanitarian need, with millions of people requiring assistance for basic necessities such as clean water, medicine, and food. Local aid workers, who are often directly affected by the disasters they respond to, play a crucial role in these efforts. The United States, as the largest humanitarian donor, has committed significant funding to support these efforts. However, funding alone is not enough, as many aid workers continue to face violence and obstacles in their work. It is crucial that we address the root causes of displacement and humanitarian need, such as conflict and climate change, and strengthen our humanitarian response globally.
