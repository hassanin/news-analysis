On March 30, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the "Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009," also known as H.R. 146. This bill aims to protect federal land, rivers, and trails, as well as establish the National Landscape Conservation System within the Department of the Interior. It designates new units in the National Park System, expands boundaries of existing parks, and establishes National Heritage Areas, a national monument, and national conservation areas. The bill also includes provisions for wildfire risk reduction, studying climate change's effects on natural resources, and research-related activities. The legislation is considered a significant piece of natural resource legislation and also includes the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, which focuses on improving the lives of Americans with paralysis through research and rehabilitation services. One provision of the Act regarding the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor Commission is interpreted by the President as requiring the Secretary of the Interior to consider congressional recommendations but not be bound by them in making appointments to the Commission.
