Thirty-five years ago today, Pan Am Flight 103 was bombed over Lockerbie, Scotland, resulting in the deaths of 270 people, including 190 Americans. The victims were from various backgrounds and had different aspirations for their futures. The tragedy had a global impact and continues to be felt by the families and friends who mourn their loved ones. The United States remains steadfast in its pursuit of justice for acts of terrorism, and last year, one of the main suspects behind the bombing was successfully taken into custody. On this anniversary, the commitment to protecting the homeland and countering terrorist threats is reiterated.
