Secretary Mnuchin announced that President Trump has authorized the Treasury Department to impose new sanctions on any person associated with the government of Turkey. These sanctions can be both primary and secondary and will target individuals involved in the ongoing military offensive in Syria and the potential targeting of civilians, infrastructure, and ethnic or religious minorities. The President also emphasized the importance of Turkey not allowing any ISIS fighters to escape. Mnuchin clarified that the sanctions are not being activated at this time, but the Treasury Department will be working with the Department of Defense and Department of State to implement them quickly. Financial institutions have been warned to be cautious as there could be sanctions. Mnuchin did not indicate when the sanctions would be activated or what specific actions would trigger their implementation. He also stated that the President does not believe his actions have led to the current situation in Syria and that discussions are ongoing between the Department of Defense and State Department. Mnuchin did not provide any updates on the ongoing China trade negotiations but mentioned that there have been productive discussions and more announcements will be made after meeting with the President. When asked about the effectiveness of the sanctions on Turkey, Mnuchin expressed confidence in their power and stated that they can shut down the Turkish economy if necessary. He also mentioned that specific discussions have taken place and that the sanctions aim to protect humanitarian issues and other people on the ground. Mnuchin did not comment on the potential visit of Turkish President Erdogan to the White House or any changes in plans. He mentioned that Secretary Pompeo has been in daily communication with lawmakers critical of the U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria and that the message to Congress is that the President will use sanctions when necessary.
