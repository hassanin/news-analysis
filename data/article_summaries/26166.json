President Trump's policies of deregulation, tax cuts, and fair trade have led to a strong economy that continues to thrive. The unemployment rate in the US has reached its lowest level since 1969, and jobless claims are at a near 49-year low. Small businesses are offering raises to attract and retain talent in a tight labor market. Wage growth is at its highest in 17 months, and the Institute for Supply Management reports strong growth in the services sector. Semi-truck orders have surged, indicating a booming economy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell describes the current economic period as "remarkably positive" and predicts low unemployment and inflation rates through 2020. Former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh believes the economy may be the strongest since 1999. Critics argue that Trump's policies have rescued the economy from previous failed policies and are benefiting American manufacturers.
