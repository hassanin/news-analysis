The White House has announced that over $29 billion in funding opportunities have already incorporated Justice40 considerations. President Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad established the Justice40 Initiative, which aims to ensure that disadvantaged communities receive 40% of the benefits from federal investments in climate, clean energy, affordable housing, clean water, and other areas. The Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments in disadvantaged communities, including $5 billion for clean school buses and the availability of tens-of-billions of dollars in funding opportunities. The Administration is launching a Justice40 Week of Action to highlight additional steps being taken to benefit communities across the country. The White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has released a report outlining how the Administration has addressed recommendations from the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council (WHEJAC) and is renewing a focus on environmental justice across the federal government. The White House has also announced the launch of a stakeholder engagement series and a new website dedicated to environmental justice initiatives. Additionally, the extended public comment period for the beta version of the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, which helps identify disadvantaged communities, has closed, and an updated version will be released in the future.
