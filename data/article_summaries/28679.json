The United States will complete its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on November 5th. This decision was made due to the failure of the agreement to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and address its destabilizing actions in the Middle East. As a result, the US will reimpose sanctions on Iran's energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors, as well as target transactions with the Central Bank of Iran and sanctioned Iranian banks. The aim is to force the Iranian regime to choose between changing its behavior or facing economic disaster. These sanctions, along with previous measures, are having a devastating effect on Iran's economy, with the Iranian rial losing 70% of its value and inflation rates soaring. The US emphasizes that its actions are directed at the regime, not the Iranian people, and that the sale of food, medicine, medical devices, and agricultural commodities to Iran will remain exempt from sanctions. The US is open to negotiating a new deal with Iran that addresses its nuclear ambitions and malign actions.
