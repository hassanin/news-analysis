This article is a presidential memorandum from September 30, 2014, regarding the admission of refugees to the United States for Fiscal Year 2015. The memorandum states that up to 70,000 refugees will be admitted to the US in FY 2015 based on humanitarian concerns or national interest. The memo also provides regional allocations for the admission of refugees, including Africa, East Asia, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, Near East and South Asia, and an unallocated reserve. The memo allows for the allocation of unused admissions to regions with greater need and designates certain persons in Cuba, Eurasia and the Baltics, Iraq, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and exceptional circumstances as refugees for admission to the US. The memorandum instructs the Secretary of State to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
