The Biden-Harris Administration has announced a National Initiative to Advance Building Codes that aims to increase resilience to climate change impacts, lower utility bills, and prioritize underserved communities. The initiative will encourage state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments to adopt the latest building codes and standards to protect against extreme weather events such as hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires. Modern building codes can save lives, reduce property damage, and lower utility bills by incorporating smart design and construction methods. Additionally, energy codes can save households an average of $162 per year on utility bills, which is especially beneficial for low-income households. Currently, nearly two-thirds of communities in the U.S. have not adopted the latest building codes, leaving them vulnerable to climate impacts and higher energy costs. The National Initiative to Advance Building Codes will accelerate the adoption of modern building codes, create jobs, and lower energy bills. The initiative will increase support and incentives for code adoption, review federal funding and financing to incorporate modern codes, and lead by example in the federal building portfolio.
