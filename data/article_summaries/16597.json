President Obama recently met with nine small business owners to discuss the impact of the government shutdown on their businesses. The President was joined by Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett, NEC Director Gene Sperling, and Acting SBA Administrator Jeanne Hulit. The small business owners expressed concerns about the effects of the shutdown on consumer confidence and the potential harm to the holiday shopping season. They shared stories about cancelled contracts, furloughed workers, and the possibility of staff reductions. President Obama thanked the business leaders for their contributions to job creation and community investment and provided an update on his discussions with Congressional caucuses.
