The article is the text of Executive Order 13567, issued by President Barack Obama on March 7, 2011. The order establishes a process for the periodic review of individuals detained at Guantánamo Bay Naval Station. It applies to detainees who were subject to the interagency review under Executive Order 13492 and are still held at Guantánamo. The order does not create any new detention authority or affect the jurisdiction of federal courts to determine the legality of detainee's detention. The Secretary of Defense is responsible for coordinating the periodic review process, which includes initial reviews, subsequent full reviews, and file reviews. The Periodic Review Board (PRB) conducts hearings and determines if continued detention is warranted. The Secretary of State and Defense are responsible for finding suitable transfer locations for detainees who are not deemed to meet the standard for continued detention. The order also establishes a Review Committee to conduct annual reviews of transfer efforts and assess the consistency of the law of war detention policy with the interests of the United States. The Departments of Justice and Defense are tasked with assessing the feasibility of prosecution for detainees designated for continued detention. Other departments and agencies of the United States are required to provide assistance to the Secretary of Defense in implementing the order. The order does not address the legality of detainee's detention, and if any material information calls into question the legality, it will be referred to the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General for appropriate action.
