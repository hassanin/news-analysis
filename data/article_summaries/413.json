The EXIM Bank Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Make More In America Initiative, which aims to strengthen domestic manufacturing and support job creation in the United States. The program aims to address barriers faced by American manufacturers, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, by providing access to capital. It also aims to level the playing field for American manufacturers by supporting their competitiveness against unfair practices overseas. The initiative aligns with the Biden-Harris Administration's goal of expanding America's global competitiveness in industries like clean energy, clean technology, and semiconductor production. The establishment of this initiative was a recommendation from President Biden's Executive Order to build resilient and sustainable supply chains.
