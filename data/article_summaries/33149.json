President Donald Trump has issued a Presidential Memoranda on immigration, specifically regarding the termination of the national emergency he declared in Proclamation 9844 on February 15, 2019. This memorandum is in response to S.J. Res. 54, a joint resolution aimed at terminating the national emergency. President Trump has returned the resolution without his approval, citing the same reasons he returned a similar resolution, H.J. Res. 46, earlier this year. Proclamation 9844 has been instrumental in addressing the ongoing crisis at the southern border, allowing the government to counter unlawful migration and respond to humanitarian challenges. It has also facilitated the construction of physical barriers along the border. President Trump argues that the southern border remains a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics, posing national security threats and exacerbating a humanitarian crisis. He believes that terminating the national emergency declaration would impede the government's ability to address these issues and is inconsistent with recent congressional actions. President Trump emphasizes that Proclamation 9844 is not a new or novel application of executive authority but rather a continuation of previous presidential invocations of the National Emergencies Act. He vetoed H.J. Res. 46 earlier this year due to concerns about its impact on U.S. sovereignty and the safety of American citizens. Similarly, he is returning S.J. Res. 54 without his approval to protect the safety and security of the nation.
