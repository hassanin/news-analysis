The economy created 199,000 jobs in November, with a total of over 14 million jobs created since the speaker took office. The unemployment rate has remained below 4% for 22 consecutive months, and inflation has fallen by two-thirds. Workers' paychecks and household wealth have increased after adjusting for inflation. The speaker claims to have achieved better growth and lower inflation than any other advanced country. However, the speaker acknowledges that prices are still too high for many Americans and vows to lower costs. They are working to bring down prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums, utility bills, and eliminate fees that rip off consumers. The speaker criticizes Republicans in Congress for fighting to raise prescription drug costs, lower taxes for the wealthy and large corporations, and cut Medicare and Social Security.
