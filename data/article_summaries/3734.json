The Biden-Harris Administration has announced ongoing and expanded efforts to combat scams and misinformation related to student debt relief. They aim to educate borrowers about protecting themselves against scams and share scam complaints with states. One important step is to create a clear, simple, and secure website for borrowers to apply for debt relief and access trusted information from sources like the Department of Education and Federal Student Aid. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will work together to hold scammers accountable. The FTC has already reached settlements totaling nearly $30 million and the CFPB has required refunds of around $8.7 million to consumers. The Administration will convene senior leaders from various agencies to discuss comprehensive scam prevention and enforcement strategies. Individuals who have been contacted by scammers are encouraged to report them to the FTC.
