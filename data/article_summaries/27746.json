The White House has announced that it will make the financial disclosure reports filed by high-level officials in the White House Office available to the public starting March 31, 2017. These reports are required under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 and the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012. The reports are used to identify and prevent potential financial conflicts of interest. The highest-level officials' reports are independently reviewed by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. The public can also request access to these reports through an online portal. The White House may release some reports before they are certified, but they are still subject to change based on the review process.
