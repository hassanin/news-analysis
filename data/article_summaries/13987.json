The White House has announced new progress and momentum in support of President Obama's Computer Science for All initiative. The goal of the initiative is to ensure that every American student has the opportunity to learn computer science. Since the President's call to action, there has been strong momentum for computer science education at all levels of government and in the private sector. Twelve states have taken concrete policy steps to expand computer science education, and there are now 31 states that allow computer science to count towards high school graduation. More than 100 organizations have pledged over $250 million to support computer science education. Additionally, a new Advanced Placement (AP) computer science course, AP Computer Science Principles, will be offered in over 2,000 U.S. classrooms this fall. The White House is hosting a summit on Computer Science for All to celebrate this progress and new commitments. Some of the key announcements include over $25 million in new grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to expand computer science education, the creation of a CSforAll Consortium of more than 180 organizations to connect stakeholders with curriculum and resources, and new commitments from over 200 organizations to expand computer science offerings.
