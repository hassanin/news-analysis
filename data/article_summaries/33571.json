President Donald Trump has sent his principles for drug pricing reform to Capitol Hill, aiming to bring lasting relief from high drug prices for America's seniors. These principles already have bipartisan support and are in line with the President's goal of lowering drug prices and increasing access to affordable drugs. The White House is urging Republicans and Democrats in Congress to pass legislation that would achieve significant drug pricing reform while still recognizing the importance of pharmaceutical innovation. The administration's focus is to help seniors and patients afford the drugs they need without harming the pharmaceutical industry.
