During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre provided an update on the response to the Maui wildfires in Hawaii. She mentioned that FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell had been in Hawaii since Saturday morning and had been providing regular updates to the President. The President has been closely engaged with his team and state and local officials to ensure a robust whole-of-government response. FEMA has already provided resources such as meals, water, cots, and blankets to the affected areas. The Coast Guard, Navy, and Marines have also supported response and rescue efforts. Administrator Criswell provided an update on the federal response, including activating FEMA's Transitional Sheltering Assistance program and providing critical needs assistance to affected residents. The federal government is working closely with state and local partners to ensure effective communication and support for survivors. Administrator Criswell also mentioned that there are ongoing search and recovery efforts to account for missing individuals. The duration of the process is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as the condition of the affected areas and weather conditions. The press briefing also addressed other topics, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, negotiations with the UAW, the Hunter Biden probe, and the use of privately-run ICE detention facilities.
