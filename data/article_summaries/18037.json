The White House and Prime Minister Netanyahu's office had been in touch about arranging a meeting between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu while he was in the United States for the AIPAC conference. They initially sought a meeting on March 18th, but the Israelis later indicated that day did not work for them. The cancellation of the meeting has not had any impact on the trip of Vice President Biden, who is currently in Israel and will be meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu. The cancellation is not considered a snub and does not impact the ongoing commitment of the United States to Israel's security. The White House is still reviewing the recent Iranian ballistic missile launch to determine if it is a violation of any United Nations Security Council resolutions. The United States has acknowledged its concerns with Iran's ballistic missile program and has put sanctions in place against Iran in the past. The President has not yet interviewed anyone for the Supreme Court vacancy and it is not known when he will make a decision. The administration is still committed to a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, but there are currently no expectations for progress in the next 11 months. The administration is open to other ways of encouraging competition in the healthcare marketplace, but the goal is to continue fostering competition and improving benefits while lowering costs. The administration is still committed to closing Guantanamo Bay and will carefully review each detainee's case and take measures to mitigate any risk they pose. Reports of an airstrike killing an ISIS leader have not been confirmed.
