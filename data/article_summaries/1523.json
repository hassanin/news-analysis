The Biden-Harris Administration has launched the Rural Partners Network (RPN) to ensure that federal resources and opportunities reach rural America. This whole-of-government effort, led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), aims to transform the way federal agencies partner with rural places to create economic opportunities. The administration has invested historic resources in rural communities through initiatives such as the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The RPN will bring federal field staff to more than 25 rural communities to help local leaders access the federal resources they need for economic development. The RPN staff will also identify challenges faced by rural communities and inform the work of the Rural Prosperity Interagency Policy Council. The RPN will help rural communities identify and leverage critical resources, boost local capacity, and foster a federal government that delivers for rural communities. The program will expand to more states and Tribal Nations in the future. The RPN field staff will provide key information to federal agencies on community needs and barriers to accessing federal resources, leading to policy changes that address the unique challenges faced by rural communities. The Biden Administration aims to change business as usual by coordinating technical assistance, sharing rural data, aligning grant requirements, and creating new resources for rural communities.
