The U.S. economy has grown by 3.1 percent over the past year, adding 2.7 million jobs. Core inflation has also decreased, leading to higher wages, wealth, and employment compared to pre-pandemic levels. Efforts to lower costs, such as lowering prescription drug costs and health insurance premiums, are ongoing. The focus is on holding large corporations accountable and ensuring savings are passed on to consumers. The aim is to avoid giving massive giveaways to the wealthy and corporations while cutting social security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The goal is to provide American families with more breathing room.
