President Biden is set to announce new actions to protect Americans against the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19. The plan includes a nationwide campaign to promote booster shots, the expansion of vaccination clinics for families, increased availability and coverage of at-home testing, support for states and communities in responding to cases, and strengthened safety measures for international travel. The administration emphasizes the importance of boosters, the vaccination of children, and the use of masks in areas of substantial or high transmission. The plan aims to keep schools open, protect the economy, and get the pandemic under control.
