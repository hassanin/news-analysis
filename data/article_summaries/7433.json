The Biden-Harris Administration has been focused on addressing supply chain disruptions and price increases by investing in the nation's goods movement supply chain. They have enacted the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, worked with ports to clear docks, launched a pilot initiative to create digital infrastructure for the supply chain, and more. Trucking plays a crucial role in the supply chain, but the industry faces challenges such as high turnover, low job quality, and a shortage of drivers. To address these issues, the Administration launched a Trucking Action Plan, which includes creating new pathways into the profession, expanding high-quality training, and improving job quality. Since the launch of the plan, there has been significant growth in trucking employment, with 35,000 more jobs than before the pandemic. Long-distance trucking employment has also seen positive momentum. The Administration has also worked to streamline the commercial driver's license (CDL) processing, resulting in a 112% increase in CDL processing compared to last year. They have also focused on scaling apprenticeships in the trucking industry, with nearly double the number of programs nationwide, potentially leading to over 10,000 new registered apprenticeships. Additionally, the Administration has partnered with veterans' organizations to attract and retain veterans in trucking jobs. The Administration's Driving Good Jobs Initiative aims to improve the quality of trucking careers by addressing issues such as misclassification, hours of service, and workplace safety.
