President Obama has declared a state of emergency in Massachusetts due to the conditions caused by Hurricane Sandy. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement the local response efforts. The Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will coordinate all disaster relief efforts to alleviate the hardships faced by the local population. FEMA is authorized to provide necessary equipment and resources to mitigate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures will be funded at 75 percent by the federal government. Justo Hern√°ndez has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
