One year ago, the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act was signed into law to revitalize American leadership in semiconductors, strengthen supply chains, protect national security, and advance American competitiveness. The United States went from producing nearly 40% of the world's chips to just over 10%, making the economy vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions. Since the legislation was signed, companies have announced over $166 billion to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States, creating jobs and opportunities across the country. Additionally, at least 50 community colleges have announced new or expanded programs to help American workers access jobs in the semiconductor industry. The CHIPS and Science Act is part of the Bidenomics agenda to bring investment and opportunity to every corner of the country. The administration will continue to implement the law, ensuring that American workers, small businesses, and families benefit from the investments and making America a leader in semiconductor manufacturing.
