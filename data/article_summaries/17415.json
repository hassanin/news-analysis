The article discusses the background information for the President's Twitter Town Hall event. The town hall will be moderated by Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder and Executive Chairman. The audience will consist of 140 guests, including 30 White House "Tweetup" participants who follow @whitehouse on Twitter. Twitter users have been posting questions using the hashtag #AskObama, and as of noon, there were already over 60,000 tweets about the event. Twitter has partnered with Mass Relevance to curate and integrate the conversations for the event. They will use algorithms to identify the most engaged tweets through retweets, favorites, and replies. A team of seasoned Twitter users will also help flag questions from their communities through retweets. Additionally, there will be two different visualization displays during the event. One will show a map of the United States with dots representing questions on the economy, and the other will track the relative percentage of questions on different topics such as jobs, education, budget, housing, and taxes. Both visualizations will be updated in real-time.
