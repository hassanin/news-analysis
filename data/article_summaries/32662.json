President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Maryland and ordered Federal assistance to supplement recovery efforts in areas affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This declaration makes Federal funding available to State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency protective measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed MaryAnn Tierney as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further assessments. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
