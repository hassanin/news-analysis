President Obama has nominated Pamela Ki Mai Chen to serve on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Chen has been an Assistant United States Attorney in the Eastern District of New York since 1998, with the exception of a four-month period in 2008 when she served as Deputy Commissioner for Enforcement for the New York State Division of Human Rights. She has held many supervisory positions during her time at the United States Attorney's Office, including Chief of the Civil Rights Section and Deputy Chief of the Public Integrity Section. Chen has also worked as a trial attorney in the Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division at the United States Department of Justice. She began her legal career at criminal defense firm Asbill, Junkin, Myers & Buffone and later worked at the law firm of Arnold & Porter. Chen received her J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center and her B.A. from the University of Michigan. President Obama is confident that Chen will serve on the federal bench with distinction.
