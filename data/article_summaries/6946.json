The Clean Water Act of 1972 was a landmark legislation that aimed to protect and restore America's waterways. Before the act, water pollution was a significant problem, with industrial waste and sewage threatening drinking water and wetlands disappearing. The Clean Water Act set national water quality standards, restricted pollution, and invested in wastewater treatment and wetlands management. Over the past fifty years, the act has led to significant improvements in water quality, with once dead rivers and lakes now thriving with wildlife. The Environmental Protection Agency, in partnership with state, local, and tribal governments, has played a crucial role in achieving these improvements. However, there are still challenges, including climate change-driven droughts, rising sea levels, and environmental injustices that leave many communities without safe drinking water. The Biden Administration has taken steps to address these threats, restoring federal protections to streams, wetlands, and waterways and investing in water infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The administration is committed to continuing the legacy of the Clean Water Act by providing access to safe water and protecting the environment. President Biden has proclaimed October 18, 2022, as the 50th Anniversary of the Clean Water Act, calling upon all Americans to recognize its significant contribution and recommit to protecting water resources.
