President Obama supports the goal of reducing costs to taxpayers by streamlining pensions for former Presidents. However, he believes that the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2016, as currently written, would have negative consequences. The bill would immediately terminate salaries and benefits for staff members working for former Presidents, without providing a transition plan. It would also impair the Secret Service's ability to protect former Presidents by ending the General Services Administration's role in managing operations, equipment, and office space. President Obama has decided to veto the bill after consulting with the offices of former Presidents, who raised concerns about its impact. The President is working with Congress to address these concerns and make technical fixes to the bill. If these fixes are made, President Obama would be willing to sign the bill.
