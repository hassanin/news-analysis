The President has issued a notice regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Somalia. This emergency was declared in 2010 due to the deteriorating security situation, violence, acts of piracy, and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia. The President states that the situation still poses a threat to national security and foreign policy, therefore the national emergency and the measures taken to address it will remain in effect for another year.
