The Biden administration has announced the cancellation of $130 million in student debt for 7,400 borrowers who attended CollegeAmerica in Colorado. These borrowers were victims of fraud and were burdened with significant amounts of debt. The previous administration failed to address the issue of colleges defrauding students, but President Biden has made it a priority to provide relief to borrowers who have been taken advantage of. So far, his administration has approved $14.7 billion in relief for 1.1 million borrowers and a total of $116 billion in debt relief for over 3.4 million Americans. The president has pledged to continue fighting for borrowers and ensuring that bad actors are held accountable, as well as expanding access to college education for more Americans.
