During a press briefing on Air Force One, White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah discussed the positive impact of the tax cut bill signed by President Trump on the Ohio economy. He highlighted the decrease in the unemployment rate in Ohio, the creation of jobs in the manufacturing sector, and the tax relief for Ohio families. Shah also expressed condolences for the victims of recent Amtrak accidents and criticized Senate Democrats for blocking the nomination of Ron Batory as the administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration. He stated that the White House would consider releasing the Democratic memo from the House Intelligence Committee, following the same process as the Nunes memo. Shah emphasized the President's concerns about political bias in the FBI and the Department of Justice and his belief that the FISA warrant and other relevant documents should be released. He also addressed questions about the stock market drop, the President's reaction to the Super Bowl, and the upcoming spending authority deadline. Shah urged Congress to reach a two-year agreement on budget caps and expressed the President's commitment to addressing immigration issues. He mentioned the President's proposals for border security, a border wall, an end to the visa lottery system, and an end to extended family chain migration. Shah confirmed that March 5th is the deadline for Congress to address the DACA issue. The briefing concluded with Shah stating that the White House is planning an event to celebrate Black History Month.
