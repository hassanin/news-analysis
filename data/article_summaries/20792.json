On the 11th anniversary of the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, the White House issued a statement by the President. The attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam resulted in the deaths of 218 people and the injury of over 5,000 others in Kenya, while 11 people were killed and more than 85 were wounded in Dar es Salaam. The statement emphasizes that these attacks by al Qaeda demonstrate their determination to harm innocent people regardless of their religion, race, or nationality. It calls for continued vigilance in working with allies to bring terrorists to justice, prevent future attacks, and promote peace and security worldwide.
