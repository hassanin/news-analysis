President Obama is set to travel to Paterson, New Jersey on September 4th to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Irene. The visit is part of the federal government's commitment to supporting the recovery efforts in states affected by the hurricane. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate have already visited New York and New Jersey to survey the response and recovery efforts. Similar trips have been made to Connecticut, North Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia by other administration officials.
