The President has signed the Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 2012, which aims to criminalize the construction or financing of unauthorized tunnels across international borders. This is part of the Obama Administration's efforts to strengthen border security and prevent smuggling, trafficking, and illegal immigration while facilitating lawful trade, travel, and immigration. The Administration has dedicated significant resources to border security in the past three and a half years, resulting in increased Border Patrol agents, unmanned aerial capabilities along the Southwest border, and reduced attempts to cross illegally. The Department of Homeland Security has also released a unified Northern Border Strategy to enhance security and expedite lawful travel and trade.
