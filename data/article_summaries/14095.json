President Obama issued a memorandum establishing the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. The commission's purpose is to review policies for managing the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, including the storage, processing, and disposal of used nuclear fuel and waste. The commission will evaluate various alternatives, including advanced fuel cycle technologies, and consider scientific, environmental, budgetary, economic, and management issues. An interim report is expected within 18 months, followed by a final report within 24 months. The Department of Energy will provide funding and administrative support, and other government agencies will assist as requested. The memorandum emphasizes the need for open and transparent proceedings, while protecting classified and sensitive information. The memorandum does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits.
