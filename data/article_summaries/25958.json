The Trump Administration has released two important documents, the Draft List of Critical Minerals and Assessment of Critical Minerals, to support Executive Order 13817, which aims to ensure secure and reliable supplies of critical minerals. Critical minerals are those that have a vulnerable supply chain and serve a vital function in manufacturing, and their absence would cause significant harm to the economy or security of the United States. Currently, the production of many critical minerals is concentrated in a few foreign countries, making the US heavily dependent on imports. The Executive Order aims to reduce this strategic vulnerability by increasing activity in the critical mineral supply chain, helping miners and producers locate domestic sources, and streamlining leasing and permitting processes. The Department of the Interior has developed a draft list of 35 critical minerals, which is open for review and comment. Additionally, a report by a Federal interagency group under the National Science and Technology Council helps assess the potential criticality of minerals. Later this year, the Department of Commerce will publish a report outlining a strategy for reducing reliance on critical minerals, exploring alternatives, and identifying options for developing new supplies.
