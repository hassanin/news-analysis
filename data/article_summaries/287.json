Kirby also addressed questions about the death of an American citizen in Ukraine, President Biden's frequent communication with Ukrainian President Zelensky, Russia's treatment of captured Americans, and China's collaboration with Russia. Regarding the gas tax holiday, Jean-Pierre stated that all options are on the table to alleviate the pain of rising gas prices, but no specific decisions have been made yet. She also addressed concerns about a potential recession, American travel during the Fourth of July holiday, and the President's stance on Colombian elections. Jean-Pierre confirmed that the State Department is working to rectify a mistake that prevented Brittney Griner, an American held in Russia, from speaking with her wife, and that a meeting between Secretary Granholm and oil and gas CEOs is scheduled. She also mentioned the President's goal to alleviate the pain of rising gas prices and the administration's focus on stable and steady economic growth. Jean-Pierre did not have information about a potential meeting or phone call between President Biden and Brittney Griner or any specific plans for tackling the federal gas tax. She emphasized that all options are being considered and that the President wants to relieve pressure on American families. Finally, Jean-Pierre stated that there is no final decision on reducing nicotine levels in cigarettes and that the White House has a key agenda item of ending cancer.
