President Obama has declared a major disaster in Arizona due to severe storms and flooding that occurred from September 7-9, 2014. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Mark H. Landry has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made later if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
