The Biden-Harris Administration is focused on strengthening the resilience of the United States' critical infrastructure, including the chemical sector, to protect the services that Americans rely on. The government is working with leading chemical companies and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) to promote a higher standard of cybersecurity in the sector. A Chemical Action Plan has been developed to assess current cybersecurity practices and implement measures to enhance visibility and threat detection for industrial control systems. This initiative is part of the broader Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Cybersecurity Initiative, which highlights the Administration's commitment to cybersecurity.
