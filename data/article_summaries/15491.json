The White House held a meeting to review the progress of the strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The President and his team discussed the progress made and areas for additional focus moving forward. The President directed his team to finalize the report and will provide an update on the strategy to the American people on Thursday. The review will focus on al Qaeda senior leadership, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The President believes that progress has been made in halting the momentum of the Taliban in Afghanistan, degrading senior al Qaeda leaders, and increasing cooperation with the Pakistani government. However, challenges remain, such as strengthening capacity in Afghanistan and addressing the ongoing threat of safe havens in Pakistan. The President is committed to beginning the transition of security to Afghan forces in 2011 and will not be making any major changes to the strategy. The review will also address the issue of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke's passing and his contributions to the policy. There is no information on who will replace Ambassador Holbrooke at this time.
