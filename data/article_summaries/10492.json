The article discusses the United States' National Action Plan on Responsible Business Conduct (RBC). RBC is the idea that businesses can perform well while also doing good, and governments should create conditions to facilitate this. The plan focuses on coordinating and promoting RBC work with partners in the private sector and other stakeholders. It is based on domestic and international best practices and is divided into five categories, including refining government purchases and finances, sharing best practices, highlighting success stories, and addressing negative impacts. The plan also emphasizes collaboration with stakeholders, including the private sector, civil society, labor, and others. It encourages companies to follow best practices and voluntarily report on their operations. The plan recognizes and highlights companies that achieve high standards and provides mechanisms for addressing concerns and seeking remedies. Stakeholders are encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions on the plan.
