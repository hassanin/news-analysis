The White House has announced a new "Smart Cities" initiative that will invest over $160 million in federal research and technology collaborations to help local communities address challenges such as traffic congestion, crime, economic growth, climate change, and city services. The initiative aims to bring together local government, nonprofits, businesses, teachers, and parents to work towards shared goals. It will focus on strategies such as creating test beds for Internet of Things applications, collaborating with civic tech movements, leveraging existing federal activities, and pursuing international collaboration. The initiative will also involve various federal agencies, including the National Science Foundation, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency. Additionally, the initiative will encourage cities, universities, industry, and other leaders to take steps to support Smart Cities. This includes launching the MetroLab Network, a consortium of city-university collaborations, and the Envision America challenge, which will help cities accelerate the deployment of innovative technologies.
