In this article, President Barack Obama announces an alternative plan for monthly basic pay increases for members of the uniformed services for 2015. He emphasizes his commitment to supporting the uniformed service members who have contributed greatly to the nation over the past decade of war. However, he also acknowledges the need to maintain a sustainable fiscal course for the country in light of budget constraints. As a result, he has decided to exercise his authority to set the 2015 monthly basic pay increase at 1.0 percent. He believes this decision is consistent with his fiscal year 2015 Budget and will not significantly impact the government's ability to attract and retain qualified members for the uniformed services. The adjustments will take effect on January 1, 2015.
