On November 27, 2018, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the situation in Nicaragua. This emergency was declared due to the violent response by the Nicaraguan government to protests that began in April 2018, as well as the regime's dismantling of democratic institutions, use of violence against civilians, and corruption leading to economic destabilization. The national emergency, originally declared in 2018, is now being extended for another year, until November 27, 2022, in order to address the ongoing threat to national security and foreign policy. This extension is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
