President Biden will sign a Presidential Memorandum on Promoting Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence to address the issue of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV), which is often overlooked and underreported. The United States aims to combat CRSV and support survivors through various measures such as legal, policy, diplomatic, and financial tools. The memorandum is being issued during the United Kingdom's international conference on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict and at a time when CRSV continues to occur with impunity in regions like Russian-occupied Ukraine and Ethiopia. The memorandum aligns with the Administration's efforts to support survivors of CRSV by promoting gender equity and equality, addressing the root causes of conflict, and advancing Women, Peace, and Security. The United States has also pledged to take additional steps to support survivors of CRSV and combat gender-based violence globally. This action reaffirms President Biden's commitment to addressing gender-based violence in all its forms and encourages the international community to join in strengthening accountability for CRSV. The approach includes promoting the well-being and healing of survivors, expanding access to justice, providing psycho-social support and other life-saving services, and supporting economic empowerment.
