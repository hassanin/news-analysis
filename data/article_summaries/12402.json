This memorandum, issued by the White House Office of the Press Secretary on January 20, 2010, addresses the issue of federal contracts being awarded to companies with tax delinquencies. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of protecting taxpayer money and the integrity of the federal acquisition process. It highlights reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that reveal federal contracts being awarded to tens of thousands of companies with serious tax delinquencies, amounting to over $5 billion in unpaid taxes. The memorandum directs the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to review certifications of non-delinquency in taxes submitted by companies bidding for federal contracts and report on the overall accuracy of these certifications within 90 days. It also directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in collaboration with the Secretary of the Treasury and other agency heads, to evaluate the practices of contracting officers and debarring officials in response to contractors' certifications of serious tax delinquencies. The goal is to provide recommendations for process improvements to ensure that these contractors are not awarded new contracts. One recommendation is to create a Government-wide database to make contractor certifications available, similar to the existing practice of sharing other contractor information. The memorandum emphasizes that the provisions should be carried out to the extent permitted by law and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities. Finally, it authorizes and directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
