The National Security Memorandum outlines the organization and structure of the National Security Council (NSC) system. The NSC is the principal forum for considering national security policy issues that require Presidential determination. The memorandum defines the membership and responsibilities of the NSC, which includes the President, Vice President, Secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, and Energy, among others. The NSC is responsible for advising and assisting the President in integrating all aspects of national security policy and coordinating executive departments and agencies. 

The memorandum also establishes the Principals Committee (PC) as the senior interagency forum for national security policy issues. The PC is chaired by the National Security Advisor and includes members such as Secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, and Homeland Security. Additional attendees are added based on the agenda, including Secretaries of Labor, Commerce, and Health and Human Services, among others.

The Deputies Committee (DC) is tasked with reviewing and monitoring the work of the NSC interagency process, resolving policy issues, and focusing on policy implementation and strategic planning. The DC is chaired by the Principal Deputy National Security Advisor and includes Deputy Secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, and Homeland Security, among others.

The memorandum also establishes Interagency Policy Committees (IPCs) as the main day-to-day fora for interagency coordination of national security policy. The IPCs provide policy analysis and coordination for the NSC system and ensure timely responses to Presidential decisions. The IPCs are chaired by designees of the National Security Advisor.

Overall, the memorandum sets out the structure and responsibilities of the NSC system, including the NSC, PC, DC, and IPCs, to facilitate the development and implementation of national security policies.
