In honor of Women's History Month, President Joe Biden proclaims March 2022 as a time to celebrate the achievements of women and girls throughout history. He acknowledges the contributions of Native American women in fighting for climate justice, Black women in the abolitionist movement and civil rights advocacy, and suffragists in securing the right to vote. The President emphasizes the importance of continuing the mission to ensure equal opportunities for women and girls. Despite progress, women, especially women of color, still face systemic barriers and disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these challenges, impacting women's labor force participation, increasing caregiving responsibilities, and contributing to gender-based violence. The President highlights his administration's efforts to advance gender equity, racial equity, and LGBTQI+ equality through executive actions, relief packages, infrastructure investments, and advocacy for legislation like the Violence Against Women Act. The Cabinet, including Vice President Kamala Harris, plays a crucial role in leading these efforts. The President calls for a more equal society where everyone has the opportunity to pursue the American dream, emphasizing the benefits to economic growth, health, safety, and national security. He invites all Americans to observe Women's History Month and International Women's Day and learn more about women's contributions to American history.
