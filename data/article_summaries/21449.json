The United States has applauded the United Nations Human Rights Council for establishing the first-ever UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of assembly and association. The resolution was co-sponsored by a group of 62 countries, including the Czech Republic, Indonesia, Lithuania, the Maldives, Mexico, and Nigeria. President Obama emphasized the importance of the freedom to assemble and urged the international community to support and monitor norms that advance the rights of civil society. The establishment of the Special Rapporteur reflects the universal recognition that the promotion of human rights is both a moral and practical necessity. The Special Rapporteur's role will be to highlight threats to assembly, association, and civil society, as well as develop best practices to protect these rights.
