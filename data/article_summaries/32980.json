The Trump Administration's response to COVID-19 has included encouraging private-sector solutions through targeted deregulation and public-private partnerships. One area that has seen significant growth is telehealth, which allows patients to connect remotely with medical professionals. Previously, telehealth adoption was limited due to various factors such as internet access, HIPAA requirements, and reimbursement arrangements. However, the government's deregulatory healthcare agenda, including the declaration of a public health emergency and the release of guidance by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has allowed for more widespread use of telehealth. The use of telehealth has increased due to the flexibility provided by Medicare telehealth services and the policy change that allows providers to use popular video platforms like Skype and Zoom. This increase in telehealth utilization has coincided with a reduction in urgent care and hospital outpatient services, potentially helping to slow the spread of COVID-19 by facilitating social distancing. Telehealth also has the potential to expand access to quality healthcare for individuals with limited physical access, reduce overhead costs, and decrease the time it takes to seek medical expertise. The government has prioritized further telehealth adoption by launching a portal and providing funding to support telehealth expansion, particularly in rural areas. However, further analysis is needed to determine the best telehealth framework for post-COVID-19 healthcare, including evaluating which treatments are appropriate for telehealth and addressing issues related to fraud and program integrity. Overall, telehealth has shown immediate benefits during the pandemic and offers long-term promise for increasing healthcare access and providing higher-value care.
