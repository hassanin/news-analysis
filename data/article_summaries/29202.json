On May 16, 2012, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to address the threat posed by certain former members of the Yemeni government and others who were obstructing the political process and impeding the implementation of a peace agreement in Yemen. The actions and policies of these individuals continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Trump has decided to extend the national emergency for one year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This decision has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
