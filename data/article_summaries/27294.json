President Trump has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 with respect to Yemen will continue beyond May 16, 2020. This is in accordance with Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, which requires the President to publish a notice in the Federal Register and transmit it to Congress within 90 days before the anniversary date of the emergency declaration. The decision to continue the national emergency is based on the actions and policies of certain former members of the Yemeni government and others who continue to threaten Yemen's peace, security, and stability. These actions include obstructing the political process and the implementation of the agreement made on November 23, 2011, for a peaceful transition of power that meets the legitimate demands and aspirations of the Yemeni people.
