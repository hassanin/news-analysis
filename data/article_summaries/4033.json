The Biden Administration is disappointed that the Supreme Court has blocked the most recent CDC eviction moratorium, as it believes that these moratoriums have saved lives by preventing the spread of COVID-19. With the Delta variant cases rising across the country, the ruling puts families at risk of eviction and communities at risk of COVID-19 exposure. President Biden is urging all entities, such as cities, states, local courts, landlords, and Cabinet Agencies, to take urgent action to prevent evictions. The White House has also released a fact sheet on additional steps being taken to prevent evictions while emergency rental assistance is being delivered.
