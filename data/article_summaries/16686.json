In his State of the Union address, President Obama emphasized the need to revive America's middle class and restore the idea that hard work leads to success, regardless of one's background or identity. He stressed the importance of creating a growing economy that generates quality jobs for the middle class and outlined three key questions the nation should ask itself: how to attract more jobs, how to provide people with the necessary skills for those jobs, and how to ensure that hard work leads to a decent living. The President also stated that his proposals would be fully funded and in line with the budget framework agreed upon by both parties. He emphasized the need for a smarter government that prioritizes and invests in broad-based growth, rather than simply expanding its size.
