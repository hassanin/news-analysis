President Biden will announce a major investment in one of the largest infrastructure projects in the country during his visit to New York City. He will be joined by New York Governor Kathy Hochul, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, and other officials. The administration has also awarded nearly $1.2 billion from the Infrastructure Law's new National Infrastructure Project Assistance discretionary grant program for nine major projects across the country. The projects include the Hudson Tunnel Project, the Brent Spence Bridge, and various other bridge and rail projects. The administration is focused on implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and delivering real results for the American people. Additionally, White House officials will attend the funeral of Tyre Nichols, who died as a result of a beating, and President Biden plans to host a small group of Congressional Black Caucus members to discuss police reform legislation. The White House is committed to ensuring fair and impartial justice in the criminal justice system. The White House is also working on lifting Title 42 in a safe and orderly way and is awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court. House Republicans have expressed a desire for a balanced budget, but the White House wants to hear their plans for responsibly reducing the deficit. The President has already taken action to reduce the deficit and is open to discussing ideas with Republicans. The President did not mention selling F-16s to Ukraine during a recent gaggle, but the US is providing significant weapons and security assistance to Ukraine in response to Russian aggression. More security assistance is expected to be announced soon.
