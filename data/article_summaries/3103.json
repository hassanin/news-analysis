LG Energy is planning to construct a new electric battery manufacturing facility in Arizona, which is set to be the largest investment in a single battery facility in North America. This development is attributed to an economic plan aimed at bringing back jobs and manufacturing to the United States. The initiative, called Investing in America, seeks to address both the economic and climate crises. By investing in infrastructure, supply chains, and domestic manufacturing, the plan aims to create millions of high-paying jobs that can support families and revitalize communities such as Queen Creek.
