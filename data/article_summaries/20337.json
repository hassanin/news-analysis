In this article, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum to the Secretary of Homeland Security regarding Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Liberians. The United States has provided safe haven for Liberians since 1991 due to armed conflict and civil strife in Liberia. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was granted to these individuals, but it ended in 2007. President Bush then deferred the enforced departure of Liberians originally granted TPS. President Obama extended this grant of DED to September 30, 2014. He has now determined that there are compelling foreign policy reasons to again extend DED for Liberians residing in the United States. The memorandum directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to defer the removal of any Liberian national or person without nationality who last resided in Liberia and is under a grant of DED as of September 30, 2011, for 24 months. The grant of DED only applies to those who have continuously resided in the United States since October 1, 2002, and meet certain criteria outlined in the memorandum. The memorandum also authorizes employment for eligible Liberians for 24 months from October 1, 2014.
