The Obama Administration has announced the establishment of a new manufacturing innovation institute in Cambridge, MA focused on fibers and textiles manufacturing. The Revolutionary Fibers and Textiles Manufacturing Innovation Institute will receive over $75 million in federal resources and nearly $250 million in non-federal investment to develop innovative fabrics and textiles with properties such as being lightweight, flame resistant, and containing electronic sensors. These technical textiles can be used in various applications such as protective gear for firefighters, smart fabrics with sensing capabilities, and antimicrobial compression bandages for wounded soldiers. This is the eighth manufacturing hub awarded by the Obama Administration as part of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), which aims to create a network of manufacturing hubs across the country. The American textile industry has been experiencing growth, with an increase in jobs and exports. In addition to the manufacturing institute, the Obama Administration has also released a new report on federal priorities for research and development (R&D) in advanced manufacturing technologies. The report highlights areas such as advanced materials manufacturing, bio-manufacturing for regenerative medicine, and continuous manufacturing for pharmaceuticals. The Obama Administration has been increasing investment in manufacturing R&D and proposes to further grow federal investment to $2.1 billion in the President's FY2017 Budget.
