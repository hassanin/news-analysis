The article discusses the framework agreement on middle-class tax cuts and unemployment insurance announced by the White House. The agreement aims to provide tax relief and investments in workers to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. The plan has three main accomplishments: preventing working families from losing their tax cuts, implementing high-impact job creation measures, and not worsening the medium- and long-term deficit. 

The agreement extends the 2001/2003 income tax rates for two years, ensuring that over 100 million middle-class families do not face a tax increase of over $2,000. It also includes provisions such as $56 billion in unemployment insurance, an approximately $120 billion payroll tax cut for working families, about $40 billion in tax cuts for hardest-hit families and students, and 100% expensing for businesses in the following year.

One significant aspect of the agreement is the growth-oriented payroll tax cut for workers, which provides a 2% employee-side payroll tax cut for over 155 million workers, resulting in approximately $120 billion in tax relief. Economists widely recognize this tax cut as an effective way to boost growth and job creation. The agreement also includes tax cuts for working families, such as an increase in the full Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, benefiting 12 million lower-income families and 24 million children.

Additionally, the agreement extends unemployment benefits at their current level for 13 months, saving millions of Americans from losing their unemployment benefits and potentially creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. It also includes business tax cuts, such as allowing businesses to expense all of their investments in 2011, which could generate more than $50 billion in additional investment in the U.S.

Overall, the framework agreement aims to provide tax relief, support job creation, and stimulate economic growth without worsening the deficit.
