The United States does not support the Kurdistan Regional Government's plan to hold a referendum, as it believes it will distract from efforts to defeat ISIS and stabilize liberated areas. The US also considers holding the referendum in disputed areas to be provocative and destabilizing. They urge the Kurdistan Regional Government to cancel the referendum and engage in meaningful dialogue with Baghdad, with the US offering assistance in facilitating this dialogue.
