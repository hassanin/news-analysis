President Trump has issued an order under the Defense Production Act to ensure that domestic manufacturers can produce ventilators needed to save American lives. The order will help manufacturers like General Electric, Hill-Rom, Medtronic, ResMed, Royal Philips, and Vyaire Medical secure the supplies they need to build ventilators. The goal is to remove obstacles in the supply chain and ramp up production to meet the demand for ventilators during the coronavirus pandemic.
