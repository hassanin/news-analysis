President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring October 16-22, 2016, as National Forest Products Week. The proclamation highlights the importance of forests in providing clean air and water, diverse habitats for wildlife, and cultural and recreational activities. It also emphasizes the need to protect and preserve forests, as they are at risk from wildfires, erosion, drought, and climate change. The proclamation acknowledges the role of forests in addressing climate change by absorbing carbon pollution and calls for the strengthening of forest resilience. The government is working with state and local leaders, landowners, and businesses to develop solutions for preserving forests and promoting their economic growth. The proclamation encourages the use of wood in innovative ways, which can improve forest health and generate rural jobs. It also calls on the American people to recognize and appreciate the individuals responsible for the stewardship and management of forests.
