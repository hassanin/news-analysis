President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of delivering them. The order directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take certain actions when the President or the Secretary of State has selected certain sanctions to impose on a country. These actions include opposing the extension of loans or financial assistance to the country by international financial institutions and prohibiting US banks from making loans or providing credit to the government of that country, except for loans or credits for the purpose of purchasing food or agricultural commodities. The Executive Order also revises a previous Executive Order by adding a corresponding delegation to the Secretary of the Treasury.
