Melania and Donald Trump have declared October as National Dyslexia Awareness Month. They are committed to improving learning environments and working conditions for people with dyslexia. They encourage Americans to learn more about dyslexia, advocate for those with the condition, and support their loved ones. Dyslexia is a learning disorder that affects reading, spelling, and speech processing. However, with early intervention and accommodations, individuals with dyslexia can reach their full potential and be successful in society. Many Americans with dyslexia have achieved great success in various fields. The Trump administration aims to ensure that individuals struggling with dyslexia receive the necessary resources to excel in school and any career. They will work with families and schools to improve early identification of dyslexia and benefit from advanced research. The administration believes that dyslexia should not be a barrier to success and will continue to expand opportunities for all Americans, including those with dyslexia.
