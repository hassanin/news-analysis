On July 27, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring the continuation of a national emergency with respect to Lebanon. This national emergency was initially declared on August 1, 2007, in response to actions by certain individuals that threatened the national security and foreign policy of the United States. These actions included undermining Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government, breaking down the rule of law through violence and intimidation, asserting Syrian control or interference in Lebanon, and infringing upon Lebanese sovereignty. The President stated that ongoing activities, such as Iran's arms transfers to Hezbollah, contribute to political and economic instability in the region and pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States. As a result, the national emergency and the measures adopted to address it will continue beyond August 1, 2018, for an additional year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
