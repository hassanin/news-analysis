The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has released a report on the implementation of the Recovery Act, and Vice President Biden has issued a statement in response. The GAO report found that overall, the Recovery Act programs and projects have been effective in creating jobs and driving economic growth. The investments made through the Recovery Act have prevented budget cuts to programs like education and Medicaid. The report also states that the Recovery Act has already been responsible for creating about 2 million jobs. The Vice President acknowledges the findings of the report and states that there is a growing consensus that the Recovery Act has helped pull the country back from economic disaster and lay a foundation for recovery. The GAO report also highlights that payments for infrastructure projects will shift from a focus on recovery to a focus on reinvestment. The report also mentions that Recovery Act funds have helped fill state budget shortfalls and avoid cuts to programs. It states that the funds have been spent wisely on various projects across the country, ranging from infrastructure improvements to renewable energy initiatives. The report also acknowledges that cost savings from projects have been reinvested in additional job-creating projects. The GAO recognizes improvements in recipient reporting and recommends improvements to the implementation of certain programs. The White House has directed agencies to assess these recommendations and consider possible improvements.
