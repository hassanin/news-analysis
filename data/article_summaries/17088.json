The PERAB will meet regularly to gather information and ideas from across the country and various sectors of the economy. It will report directly to the President on policies to promote economic growth, create jobs, and improve the long-term prosperity of the American people. The Department of the Treasury will provide funding and administrative support for the PERAB. The board will terminate after two years unless extended by the President. The order also clarifies that the PERAB's functions will be performed in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
