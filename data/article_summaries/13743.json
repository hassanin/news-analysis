First Lady Michelle Obama presented visiting foreign dignitaries at The Pittsburgh Summit 2009 with a one-of-a-kind porcelain tea set, White House honey, and a honey vase. The tea set features a platinum and purple porcelain design inspired by the White House China used by President and Mrs. Lincoln in 1861. The platinum symbolizes Pittsburgh's steel industry roots, while purple represents the state flower of Illinois, the home states of both Presidents Lincoln and Obama. The tea cups also contain a rose at the bottom, representing the official flower of the United States and the American beauty rose, the official flower of Washington. The saucer features a three-flower bouquet consisting of the purple violet, the state flower of Illinois, the Mountain Laurel, the state flower of Pennsylvania, and a rose, the national flower. The White House Honey used for the gifts was produced from the first beehive located on White House property near the First Lady's White House Kitchen Garden. The honey vase is made of lead-free crystal mined from minerals found only in the United States and is hand-blown and shaped by a California artist, signed by the First Lady.
