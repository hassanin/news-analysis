The US government has announced new vaccination and testing requirements for international air travel. Starting November 8th, non-citizen air travelers to the US who are not immigrants will be required to be fully vaccinated and provide proof of vaccination before flying to the US. The vaccination requirement will accept FDA-approved or authorized and WHO Emergency Use Listed vaccines. There will be limited exemptions for non-citizens, including children under 18 and countries with less than a 10 percent vaccination rate. The testing requirements for all air travelers to the US, regardless of citizenship, will also be amended. Fully vaccinated passengers will need to show a pre-departure negative COVID test taken within three days of travel, while unvaccinated passengers, including US citizens and permanent residents, will need to take a test within one day of departure. Passengers will also be required to provide contact information to airlines before boarding flights to the US. The new system will be implemented on November 8th, and additional implementation details for land travel will be announced soon.
