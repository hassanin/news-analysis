President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency in response to the threat posed by China's exploitation of United States capital. The order aims to address China's use of US capital to develop and modernize its military, intelligence, and security apparatuses, which directly threaten the United States. China's strategy of Military-Civil Fusion involves compelling civilian Chinese companies to support its military and intelligence activities, with many of these companies raising capital through sales to US investors. The Executive Order prohibits certain purchases involving publicly traded securities of Communist Chinese military companies and transactions that evade or avoid its prohibitions. The Secretary of the Treasury has been delegated the authority to implement the order in consultation with other relevant departments and agencies. All US government agencies are directed to take appropriate measures to carry out the provisions of the Executive Order.
