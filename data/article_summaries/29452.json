In a recent meeting, President Trump and Democratic leaders were unable to come to an agreement to end the partial government shutdown and address the immigration crisis at the southern border. The President asked Speaker Pelosi if she would be willing to fund a wall or barrier on the border if the government reopened, to which she said no. The President then ended the meeting. Republican leaders expressed disappointment and frustration with the Democrats' unwillingness to negotiate and offer a counterproposal. The Department of Homeland Security emphasized the need for a wall to address the security and humanitarian crisis at the border. The President is considering declaring a national emergency to secure funding for the wall. The Vice President and Republican leaders urged Democrats to come back to the table and negotiate in good faith.
