President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed June 2021 as National Immigrant Heritage Month in the United States. In his proclamation, he emphasizes that America has always been a nation of immigrants, and that immigrants have enriched the country throughout its history. He acknowledges the contributions of immigrant workers, innovators, entrepreneurs, and community leaders, particularly during the difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic. President Biden also recognizes the challenges faced by immigrants due to systemic racism and barriers to opportunity, and he has made equity a priority in his administration. He calls on Congress to pass the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would provide a pathway to lawful permanent residency and citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including Dreamers, individuals with Temporary Protected Status, farm workers, and essential workers. The President urges Americans to celebrate immigrant heritage, stories, and cultures, and encourages learning about the history of immigrant communities.
