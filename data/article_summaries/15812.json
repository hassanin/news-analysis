President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Washington and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms, straight-line winds, flooding, landslides, and mudslides occurred between November 12-21, 2015. The federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures in certain counties. Thomas J. Dargan has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Further designations may be made if requested by the state and deemed necessary based on damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
