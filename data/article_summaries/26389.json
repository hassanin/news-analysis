The article discusses a letter written by President Donald Trump to the Speaker of the House regarding the recent actions taken by the People's Republic of China to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy. The letter states that a national emergency has been declared, and that Hong Kong is no longer considered sufficiently autonomous to justify differential treatment under US laws. The letter directs executive departments and agencies to suspend or eliminate different and preferential treatment for Hong Kong. The order also blocks the property and interests of foreign persons determined by the Secretary of State or the Secretary of the Treasury. Additionally, the order suspends the entry into the US of aliens who meet certain criteria related to the blocking of property. The letter concludes with the President enclosing a copy of the order issued.
