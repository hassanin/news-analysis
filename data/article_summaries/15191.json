The White House Office of Public Engagement is hosting The Arc, a national community-based organization for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, as part of the White House Community Leaders Briefing Series. This series allows grassroots leaders to engage in a two-way dialogue with the White House and stay informed about government policies and programs. The event will be livestreamed on the White House website. Several individuals, including Matthew Grafton from Alabama, Bruce and Joe Hulick from Pennsylvania, and the Van Winkle family from Ohio, will be participating in the briefing and sharing their experiences.
