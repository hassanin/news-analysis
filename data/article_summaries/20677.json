During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney discussed a range of topics, including the effort to renew jobless benefits, the ongoing negotiations with Iran, the situation in Afghanistan, and the Affordable Care Act. Carney emphasized the need to renew jobless benefits for the 1.3 million Americans who are currently without assistance. He also expressed concern about the potential negative effects of passing new sanctions legislation against Iran, arguing that it could undermine the ongoing negotiations and make it more difficult to achieve a peaceful resolution. On Afghanistan, Carney stated that the U.S. remains committed to working with the Afghan government on a range of issues, including the bilateral security agreement. He also acknowledged ongoing issues with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but stressed that the administration is actively working to address these problems and ensure that people have access to the coverage they need.
