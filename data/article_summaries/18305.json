The United States strongly condemns the conviction of Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani in Iran. The pastor has been convicted for maintaining his devout faith, which is a fundamental right for all individuals. The Iranian authorities' attempt to force him to renounce his faith goes against the religious values they claim to uphold, violates basic decency, and goes against Iran's international obligations. If the death penalty is imposed, it would further demonstrate Iran's disregard for religious freedom and its ongoing violation of the universal rights of its citizens. The US calls for the immediate release of Pastor Nadarkhani and urges Iran to show a commitment to basic human rights, including freedom of religion.
