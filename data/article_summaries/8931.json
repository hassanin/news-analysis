During a press briefing, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre provided updates on various topics. First, she announced that President Biden is cracking down on junk fees in retirement investment advice, aiming to protect retirement security for Americans. The President is taking action to ensure that financial advisors prioritize their clients' best interests rather than their own financial gains. This crackdown on junk fees could save Americans billions of dollars and prevent conflicts of interest that cost middle-class savers up to 20 percent of their retirement savings over a lifetime.

Jean-Pierre also highlighted the President's efforts to lower prescription drug costs through Medicare price negotiation. The drug Enbrel, used to treat certain types of arthritis, has been selected for price negotiation, as it has been costly for Medicare recipients. The President believes that seniors should not have to choose between healthcare and other basic needs due to high drug costs.

Regarding foreign policy, Jean-Pierre mentioned that President Biden held a meeting with bipartisan senators to discuss trust, safety, and accountability in AI development. The President signed an executive order focused on safety, security, and trust in AI innovation, emphasizing the need for legislation to support these efforts.

He mentioned the ongoing efforts to deliver humanitarian aid and address the worsening humanitarian situation. Kirby also discussed the importance of supporting Ukraine in its defense against threats and reiterated the United States' commitment to national security interests in the region.

During the Q&A session, Kirby addressed questions about Israeli airstrikes and civilian casualties, the potential for a humanitarian pause, and the United States' stance on Israel and Ukraine funding. He emphasized the importance of minimizing civilian casualties, the need for humanitarian aid, and the interconnectedness of the situations in Israel and Ukraine. Kirby also mentioned ongoing discussions with the Israelis and other regional partners to address the situation.

The briefing also touched on topics such as potential terrorist threats, the upcoming meeting between President Biden and King Abdullah II of Jordan, and the monitoring of potential terrorist activity at the U.S. southern border.

Regarding domestic issues, Jean-Pierre addressed questions about the retirement advisor rule, potential trips by the President, and concerns about support among Arab and Muslim Americans. She reiterated the President's commitment to being a president for all Americans and emphasized the importance of engaging with diverse communities.

In response to questions about polling data and concerns among Muslim Americans, Jean-Pierre acknowledged the challenges faced by these communities and emphasized the administration's commitment to combating hate and discrimination. She mentioned ongoing engagement with Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian American leaders to address their concerns and gather feedback.
