The United States strongly condemns North Korea for its recent test of a long-range ballistic missile. The US government has publicly released information stating that the tests on February 26 and March 4 involved an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) system. The US president and his national security team are closely assessing the situation with their allies and partners. This launch is seen as a violation of UN Security Council resolutions and is raising tensions in the region. The US urges all countries to hold North Korea accountable for these violations and calls for serious negotiations. While diplomacy is still an option, North Korea must immediately stop its destabilizing actions. The US will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of its homeland and its allies in South Korea and Japan.
