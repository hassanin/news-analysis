President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Vermont and ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts after severe storms and flooding occurred from April 15-18, 2014. The federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
