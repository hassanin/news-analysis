President Barack Obama has proclaimed October 9th as Leif Erikson Day in honor of the first European known to set foot on North American soil over a thousand years ago. The proclamation pays tribute to the rich Nordic-American heritage and the contributions of Nordic immigrants to the United States. Leif Erikson's courage and spirit of exploration are seen as symbols of fortitude and inspiration for immigrants who crossed the Atlantic to the New World. The proclamation encourages Americans to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor this heritage.
