The United States has announced that Turkey's decision to purchase Russian S-400 air defense systems makes it impossible for Turkey to continue its involvement with the F-35 fighter jet program. The F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform, as it could compromise the jet's advanced capabilities. The US has been working with Turkey to provide alternative air defense solutions, including offering the US PATRIOT air defense system. Turkey's acceptance of the S-400 undermines NATO Allies' commitment to move away from Russian systems and will have negative effects on Turkish interoperability with the Alliance. Despite this, the US still values its strategic relationship with Turkey and will continue to cooperate with them in other areas.
