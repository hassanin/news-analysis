The proclamation recognizes the challenges that caregivers face, including balancing their caregiving duties with their own responsibilities and the importance of their selflessness and dedication. President Trump highlights the two pieces of legislation he signed into law in 2018, the RAISE Family Caregivers Act and the Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act, which aim to provide strategies and support networks for family caregivers. He also mentions the progress made by the Advisory Councils created by these acts and their work towards developing a National Caregiving Strategy in 2021. The article emphasizes the significance of family caregivers in providing care and support for veterans, with over 5 million caregivers in this category. The Department of Veterans Affairs has established the first National Center of Excellence for veteran and caregiver research to improve services and outcomes for patients and families dealing with caregiving. President Trump concludes by urging Americans to honor and thank family caregivers and to provide them with understanding, support, and gratitude.
