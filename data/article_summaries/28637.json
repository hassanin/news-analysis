The Presidential Memoranda issued on August 8, 2020, titled "Deferring Payroll Tax Obligations in Light of the Ongoing COVID-19 Disaster," orders the Secretary of the Treasury to defer certain payroll tax obligations for American workers. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the American economy, and this memorandum aims to provide temporary relief to support working Americans. The deferral applies to the withholding, deposit, and payment of the tax imposed on wages or compensation paid between September 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. The deferral is available for employees whose wages or compensation are less than $4,000 per bi-weekly pay period. The deferred amounts will not incur penalties, interest, or additional taxes. The Secretary of the Treasury will issue guidance to implement this memorandum, and avenues, including legislation, will be explored to eliminate the obligation to pay the deferred taxes. The memorandum does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, and it will be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. The memorandum will be published in the Federal Register.
