On March 8, 2015, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13692, declaring a national emergency with respect to the situation in Venezuela. The order was based on several factors including the erosion of human rights guarantees, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, use of violence and human rights violations in response to antigovernment protests, and arbitrary arrest and detention of antigovernment protestors. 

Since then, several additional executive orders have been issued to address serious abuses of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the deepening humanitarian crisis, rampant public corruption, repression of the political opposition, and attempts to undermine democratic order. These executive orders have imposed sanctions and taken other steps to address the situation in Venezuela.

In the latest statement on March 5, 2020, President Trump states that the circumstances described in the previous executive orders have not improved and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, he is continuing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692 for another year.
