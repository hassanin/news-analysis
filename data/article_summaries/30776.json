President Donald J. Trump has announced his intention to end the suspension of Argentina's designation as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. This means that Argentina will be added to the list of GSP beneficiary developing countries in the United States' Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Additionally, President Trump has also announced his intention to suspend the duty-free treatment for certain eligible articles from Ukraine under the GSP program. This decision was made after considering various criteria, including the extent to which a designated beneficiary developing country is providing adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights.
