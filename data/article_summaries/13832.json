President Obama spoke with President Putin of Russia for 90 minutes about the situation in Ukraine. He expressed concern over Russia's violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, which is a breach of international law. The United States condemns Russia's military intervention and calls for the withdrawal of Russian forces from Crimea. Obama urged Russia to address concerns about ethnic Russian and minority populations in Ukraine through peaceful dialogue with the Ukrainian government and international observers. The United States will consult with allies and partners and suspend participation in preparatory meetings for the G-8. Russia's violation of international law will lead to greater isolation. The US will provide support to the Ukrainian government, including technical and financial assistance, to ensure stability, reforms, successful elections, and a democratic future.
