President Obama has signed a proclamation to establish the Point Arena-Stornetta Unit as part of the California Coastal National Monument. This designation protects approximately 1,665 acres of public lands along the Mendocino coastline in Northern California. The goal of this action is to preserve these pristine federal lands for future generations and support the local economy. The Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands are a popular destination for outdoor recreation and wildlife viewing. The designation of this area as a national monument is the result of years of work by the local community and lawmakers. The Bureau of Land Management will continue to manage the monument as part of the National Conservation Lands system. The President's budget includes a request to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to support additional conservation efforts across the country. This action is in line with the Administration's America's Great Outdoors initiative, which aims to prioritize conservation based on the American people's priorities. President Obama has also established nine other National Monuments during his time in office. The Antiquities Act, used by President Obama in this proclamation, has been used by 16 presidents since 1906 to protect unique natural and historic features in America.
