President Obama has announced that two transit projects in Minnesota and Ohio will be expedited as part of the We Can't Wait initiative. These projects aim to improve local and regional connectivity and provide more transportation choices for residents and commuters. The projects will utilize best practices, such as conducting permitting and environmental review processes concurrently, to save time and accelerate project schedules. The Office of Management and Budget is overseeing a government-wide effort to make the permitting and review process for infrastructure projects more efficient and effective. The administration's goal is to add transparency, accountability, and certainty into the process to facilitate the modernization of the nation's infrastructure. The Southwest Light Rail Transitway in Minneapolis aims to improve accessibility and mobility by adding over 15 miles of new track, new stations, and park-and-ride lots. The project will enhance transit travel speeds and connect major activity centers. The University Circle-Little Italy Rapid Station project in Cleveland involves relocating an existing station, constructing a new rail transit station, and rehabilitating transit track bridges. The project aims to integrate the station with high employment areas and replace an obsolete station with an energy-efficient building. Both projects are expected to benefit from enhanced coordination processes and more efficient environmental assessments, resulting in time savings.
