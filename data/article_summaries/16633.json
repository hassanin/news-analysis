On June 18, 2009, President Barack Obama sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13159 will continue beyond its anniversary date of June 21, 2009. This emergency relates to the risk of nuclear proliferation caused by the accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in Russia. The United States aims to ensure that this material is used for peaceful purposes, subject to transparency measures, and protected from diversion to activities of proliferation concern. The continued accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in Russia poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama has determined it necessary to maintain the national emergency and the associated authorities to address this threat.
