In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki provided an update on the ongoing assistance the United States is providing to Ukraine. President Biden has committed more security assistance to Ukraine over the past year than at any other time in history, with an additional $350 million of military assistance authorized on Friday night. The total security assistance approved for Ukraine over the past year is $1 billion. The United States is also the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, with over $106 million provided in the past year. Psaki also discussed the possibility of imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but stated that it would require deploying U.S. military and potentially lead to a direct conflict with Russia, which the U.S. is not planning to be a part of. Psaki emphasized that the U.S. is focused on rallying the world to stand up against Russian aggression and impose severe consequences on President Putin and the Russian elite, while minimizing the impact on the global markets and the American people. Psaki also addressed the issue of nuclear war, stating that the U.S. sees no reason to change its alert levels and reminding that both the U.S. and Russia have long agreed that nuclear use would have devastating consequences and should be avoided. In terms of the State of the Union address, Psaki stated that President Biden will talk about efforts to rally the world against Russian aggression and the steps taken to mitigate the impact on the global economy and the American people. She also mentioned that the President will call on Congress to pass bills that deliver progress on reducing costs for the American people in areas such as childcare, healthcare, and prescription drugs.
