President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued an executive order declaring a national emergency to address the trafficking of illicit drugs, particularly fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, into the United States. The order aims to combat drug cartels, transnational criminal organizations, and their facilitators, which are the primary sources of illicit drugs. The President finds that international drug trafficking poses an extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to impose sanctions on foreign persons engaged in activities that contribute to the proliferation of illicit drugs or provide support to such activities. The sanctions include blocking property and interests in property, prohibiting financial transactions, and restricting investments. The order also suspends the entry of noncitizens who meet the criteria and have been selected for sanctions. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security will implement the order in relation to visas and entry into the United States, respectively. The order includes provisions to prevent evasion or violation of the sanctions, and prohibits donations to sanctioned persons. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to take necessary actions to implement the order, and recurring reports on the national emergency will be submitted to Congress. The order does not affect the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
