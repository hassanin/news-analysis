The White House has congratulated Drs. Francis Collins and Tony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on the promising results from Phase 1 clinical trials of an Ebola vaccine candidate. The vaccine has shown initial promise in preventing the spread of the Ebola virus infection. The Department of Health and Human Services' agencies, including NIH, the centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority, have worked diligently to conduct expedited vaccine trials as part of the Administration's aggressive response to the Ebola crisis. The results of these trials lay the groundwork for larger-scale clinical trials in Ebola-impacted countries. President Obama will visit NIH next week to congratulate the NIH team, discuss progress on other fronts of the fight against Ebola, and make the case for prompt Congressional action on his emergency funding request to combat Ebola at home and abroad.
