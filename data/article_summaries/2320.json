President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Nebraska due to severe storms and straight-line winds that occurred in July 2021. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Robert Haywood has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Further designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments.
