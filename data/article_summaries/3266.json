President Biden has issued an executive order to address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color and other underserved populations in the United States. The order establishes a COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide recommendations on mitigating health inequities caused by the pandemic. The task force will collaborate with relevant agencies to expedite data collection for these communities and develop recommendations for future pandemic responses. Additionally, the order directs various government departments to assess pandemic response plans and policies to ensure equitable allocation of resources and strengthen enforcement of anti-discrimination requirements. The Secretary of HHS will also provide recommendations on recruiting workers from impacted communities and promoting vaccine trust and uptake. The order is intended to address health and social inequities resulting in higher rates of COVID-19 exposure, illness, and death in underserved populations.
