The White House has announced new commitments in support of President Obama's Nation of Makers initiative. The initiative aims to give students, entrepreneurs, and citizens access to new technologies and resources to design, build, and manufacture products. The commitments include grants, education initiatives, training, and knowledge networks from eight federal agencies, as well as the dedication of maker spaces in over 1,400 K-12 schools. Other commitments include the distribution of foldable microscopes to children, investment in new makerspaces by Google, and support for making at universities and colleges. The National Week of Making is being celebrated with events around the country, including a Maker Faire in Washington, D.C. Various federal agencies are also taking steps to support the maker movement, including the Department of Education, Department of Veterans Affairs, Food and Drug Administration, NASA, National Science Foundation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Additionally, over 1,500 organizations are making commitments to support making, including schools, colleges and universities, and communities.
