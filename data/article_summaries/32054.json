President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order aimed at promoting healthcare choice and competition in the United States. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services, the Treasury, and the Department of Labor to take action to increase competition, choice, and access to lower-priced, high-quality healthcare options. The plan seeks to expand choices and alternatives to Obamacare plans and increase competition to lower costs for consumers. It also encourages the expansion of Associated Health Plans (AHPs) and low-cost short-term limited duration insurance (STLDI). The order also considers changes to Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) to allow employers to better finance their employees' healthcare needs. The President argues that Obamacare is failing to deliver quality healthcare options, resulting in higher premiums and fewer choices for Americans. The order aims to create a competitive national marketplace that will bring costs down and provide better care.
