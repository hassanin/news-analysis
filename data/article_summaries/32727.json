EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt held a press briefing to discuss President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accord. Pruitt praised the President's decision, stating that it put America's interests first. He emphasized that the US has already made significant progress in reducing its carbon footprint through innovation and technology, not government mandates. Pruitt also mentioned that the US will continue to engage with other countries on climate issues and may re-enter the Paris Agreement or negotiate a new deal with a commitment to putting America first. During the briefing, Pruitt did not directly answer questions about whether the President believes climate change is real or a hoax.
