The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet on harnessing the small satellite revolution to promote innovation and entrepreneurship in space. The fact sheet highlights the progress made in developing new technologies that pioneer new frontiers in space and test the bounds of knowledge and discovery. It emphasizes the importance of making satellites more affordable, adaptable, and adept at providing real-time information. The fact sheet discusses the capabilities of small satellites ("smallsats") and constellations of smallsats in supporting commercial, civilian, and national-security applications. It explains that smallsats, weighing anywhere from an ounce to a few hundred pounds, have disrupted the traditional large satellite industry, offering capabilities at a fraction of the cost and time. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is announcing the "Harnessing the Small Satellite Revolution" initiative, working with various federal agencies to promote and support the use of small satellites. NASA will propose up to $30 million to support data buys for smallsats and establish a Small Spacecraft Virtual Institute to provide technical knowledge and promote relevant programs. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has awarded a $20 million contract to Planet to obtain imagery of at least 85 percent of the Earth's landmass every 15 days. The Department of Commerce is elevating the role of the Office of Space Commerce to reflect the growing importance of commercial space. The fact sheet also mentions initiatives by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) to utilize small satellites for weather data and analysis of overhead imagery, respectively. Overall, these actions aim to harness the potential of the small satellite revolution to advance knowledge and understanding in space exploration.
