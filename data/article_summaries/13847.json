President Obama has directed the Office of Management and Budget, along with other federal agencies, to prevent contractors with unpaid taxes from receiving new government contracts. The IRS will also review companies' claims about tax delinquency to ensure their accuracy. The President is urging Congress to provide the necessary tools to prevent tax-delinquent companies from profiting from government contracts. The directive aims to promote responsible use of tax dollars and hold contractors accountable for paying taxes and following other laws. This effort builds on previous steps taken by the Administration to eliminate waste and improve government contracting.
