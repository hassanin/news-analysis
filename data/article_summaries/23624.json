Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder announced $1 billion in grants to fund the hiring and rehiring of law enforcement officers across the United States. The grants, provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, will be awarded to 1,046 law enforcement agencies in all 50 states. The funds will cover 100 percent of the approved salary and benefits for 4,699 officers for three years, with the requirement for police departments to retain the grant-funded positions for a fourth year. The grants aim to build safer communities and support those who keep the streets safe. The U.S. Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) will administer the grants through the COPS Hiring Recovery Program. The program aims to provide financial support to state, local, and tribal governments to enhance law enforcement efforts and fight crime through community policing. The grants received over 7,200 applications for more than 39,000 officer positions, representing $8.3 billion in requested funding. The Recovery Act also includes $4 billion in Department of Justice grant funding to enhance law enforcement efforts, combat violence against women, and fight internet crimes against children.
