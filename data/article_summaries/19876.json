President Obama is set to sign the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA), which aims to reduce wasteful and improper payments by $50 billion by 2012. The bill received unanimous support in both the House and the Senate. Improper payments include those made in the wrong amount, to the wrong person, or for the wrong reason. In 2009, improper payments totaled nearly $110 billion, the highest amount to date. The President has already taken steps to reduce improper payments, such as issuing an executive order and directing federal departments to intensify payment recapture audits. The IPERA will further improve agency efforts to reduce and recover improper payments by requiring annual risk assessments, expanding payment recovery audits, and allowing agency heads to use recovered funds for various purposes. It also establishes compliance requirements and repercussions for non-compliance.
