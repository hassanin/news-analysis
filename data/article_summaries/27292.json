This executive order, issued by President Donald J. Trump on January 18, 2021, focuses on the security of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) owned and operated by the Federal Government. The order aims to protect the integrity of American infrastructure, including the National Airspace System (NAS), as well as law enforcement and national security interests. The policy states that reliance on UAS and components manufactured by foreign adversaries poses a threat to national and economic security. The order directs executive departments and agencies to review their authorities and funding related to the procurement of UAS from foreign adversaries. It also requires agencies to report on the security protocols and manufacturers of UAS currently owned or operated by them. Furthermore, the order calls for the assessment of security risks posed by the existing Federal UAS fleet and the proposal of regulations regarding the use of UAS over critical infrastructure or sensitive sites. The replacement of covered UAS is prioritized in budget proposals, and possible sources of funding for replacement are to be identified. The order provides definitions for terms such as "adversary country," "covered UAS," and "critical electronic component." It also includes general provisions to ensure its implementation is consistent with applicable law.
