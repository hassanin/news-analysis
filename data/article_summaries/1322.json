President Biden is en route to Belvidere, Illinois to mark the reopening of the Belvidere Assembly Plant, which Stellantis closed in March 2023. Under President Biden, the plant is reopening and bringing back over 1,200 jobs at higher wages. Stellantis is also investing in new multibillion-dollar battery manufacturing, which will create over 1,000 more UAW jobs. President Biden will celebrate the labor movement and the fights it has led to increase middle-class wages. The reopening is a result of the historic contract between the UAW and the Big Three. The President also applauded SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers for working together in good faith towards an agreement.
