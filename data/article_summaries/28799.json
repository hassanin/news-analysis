On December 13, 2018, the President signed into law several bills. One of them is the "Anwar Sadat Centennial Celebration Act," which awards a Congressional gold medal to Anwar Sadat posthumously for his contributions to peace in the Middle East. Another bill designates a United States Postal Service facility in Tilden, Texas, as the Tilden Veterans Post Office. Additionally, a Federal building and United States courthouse in Dayton, Ohio, will be named the Walter H. Rice Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Two other bills designate USPS facilities in Saunderstown, Rhode Island, and Macon, Missouri, as the Captain Matthew J. August Post Office and the Arla W. Harrell Post Office, respectively.
