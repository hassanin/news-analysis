Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown in California, discussing the ongoing efforts to address issues in the northern area of Central America. She emphasized the importance of a public-private partnership and a holistic approach to empower the people in the region. Harris stated that the goal is to create opportunities and invest in the region to address the root causes of migration. She acknowledged that government alone cannot achieve lasting impact and highlighted the need to engage with the private sector. The priorities include improving the economic condition, combating corruption, reducing violence, empowering women, and upholding the rule of law. Harris expressed gratitude to Ajay Banga, Chair of the initiative, and the 40 companies and organizations involved in the effort. She mentioned that they have already brought together $3.2 billion for the region and anticipate further success in the future.
