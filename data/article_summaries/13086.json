Senator Robert C. Byrd, a true champion for the people of West Virginia, has passed away. He was a respected leader and an advocate for the Constitution. Despite his rise to power, he always remained connected to his home state. Byrd had the courage to stick to his principles, but also had the ability to change over time. He was deeply committed to the Senate and its responsibilities, earning the respect of members from both parties. He will be remembered for his generosity and his passion for history. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the people of West Virginia.
