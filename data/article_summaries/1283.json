President Biden and Vice President Harris have implemented an economic strategy focused on rebuilding the economy from the middle class and the bottom up, rather than the top down. Despite facing challenges such as the pandemic, unemployment, supply chain issues, and the risk of small businesses closing, they recognized the need to address long-standing issues like inequality and disinvestment in communities. The President aimed to move away from failed trickle-down policies by increasing taxes for the wealthy and corporations, investing in infrastructure and education, and promoting market competition. This economic vision, known as Bidenomics, is already showing positive results for the American people, including Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander communities.
