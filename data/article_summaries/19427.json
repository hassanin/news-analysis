President Obama is joined by members of Congress, including Senator John McCain, Senator Carl Levin, Senator Claire McCaskill, Rep. Edolphus Towns, and Rep. Peter Welch, to discuss the reform of the government procurement process. The Obama Administration inherited a $1.3 trillion budget deficit and is focused on turning the page on irresponsible spending. The President signed a Presidential Memorandum that aims to save taxpayers billions of dollars by strengthening oversight and management of taxpayer dollars, ending unnecessary contracts, maximizing competitive procurement processes, and clarifying rules for outsourcing. The Office of Management and Budget will issue guidance to agencies to ensure efficient and effective government functions. The President also supports the bipartisan effort on defense procurement reform led by Senators Levin and McCain, aiming to reduce delays and costs, invest in cost-effective technologies, and increase oversight. Government spending on contracting has doubled in the last eight years, with cost overruns of 26 percent in major defense acquisitions projects. The Memorandum directs collaboration between various agencies to develop procurement reform guidance and sets deadlines for reviewing existing contracts, governing the use of noncompetitive contracts, maximizing competition, reviewing the acquisition workforce, and clarifying guidelines for governmental outsourcing.
