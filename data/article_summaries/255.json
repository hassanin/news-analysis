The Respect for Marriage Act has been passed by the Senate in a bipartisan manner, bringing the United States closer to recognizing that love is love and everyone has the right to marry the person they love. This legislation will protect the rights and benefits of LGBTQI+ and interracial couples and their children. It will also provide hope for LGBTQI+ youth, showing them that they can have fulfilling lives and families. The Senate's passage of the act is a result of the determined efforts of members of Congress, including Senators Baldwin, Collins, Portman, Sinema, Tillis, and Feinstein, who have demonstrated that support for the right of LGBTQI+ and interracial couples to marry crosses party lines. The President is eagerly awaiting the House to pass the legislation so that they can sign it into law.
