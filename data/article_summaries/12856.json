President Obama has signed a major disaster declaration for the state of Florida due to severe storms, flooding, tornadoes, and straight-line winds that occurred starting on March 26, 2009. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding is available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Jeffrey L. Bryant has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Additional designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments.
