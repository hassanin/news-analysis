President Biden has announced the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, a new initiative aimed at driving economic growth in the Western Hemisphere. The initial partners of this initiative include Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay. These countries represent about 90 percent of the Western Hemisphere's GDP and two-thirds of its population. The United States already has free trade agreements with nine of these partners and aims to strengthen and expand its economic ties through the Americas Partnership. The initiative focuses on promoting bottom-up and middle-out economic growth, creating good-quality jobs, and enhancing competitiveness. It also aims to address the climate crisis and foster regional competitiveness, resilience, shared prosperity, and sustainable investment. The Americas Partnership is open to all countries that share the values and vision for a prosperous hemisphere. The execution of the initiative will involve negotiations on commitments and other areas of cooperation, with input from various stakeholders such as labor groups, environmental organizations, civil society, industry, businesses, and Congress.
