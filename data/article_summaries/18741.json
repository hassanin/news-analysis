President Obama hosted the White House Tribal Nations Conference, providing leaders from federally recognized tribes the opportunity to interact directly with him and representatives from his Administration. The conference focused on topics such as job creation, tribal communities, natural resources, healthcare, education, housing, infrastructure, and strengthening the government-to-government relationship. During the conference, the President signed an Executive Order to expand educational opportunities and improve outcomes for American Indian and Alaska Native students. The White House also released a report summarizing actions taken to address the concerns of these communities. Additionally, eleven Native American youth leaders were honored at the White House as Champions of Change for their innovative programs and efforts to improve their communities. The Department of Interior also announced a reform of federal surface leasing regulations for American Indian lands to streamline processes and promote economic development.
