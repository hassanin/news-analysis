President Obama will be hosting President Anibal Cavaco Silva of Portugal for a meeting in the Oval Office on November 9th. This meeting is seen as a way for President Obama to reciprocate the warm hospitality he received during his visit to Lisbon in November 2010. The United States and Portugal are strong NATO allies and work closely together in the United Nations Security Council, where Portugal currently serves as Council President. President Obama is looking forward to consulting with President Cavaco Silva about preparations for the 2012 NATO Summit that the U.S. will be hosting in Chicago. Additionally, the two Presidents will discuss the revitalized U.S.-Portugal Bilateral Commission, enhancing bilateral economic and commercial relations, cooperation in education, science and technology, promoting democracy, good governance, and human rights globally, as well as U.S. support for Portugal's implementation of its IMF-EU reform program.
