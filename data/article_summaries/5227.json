President Joseph R. Biden has issued an order to augment the active Armed Forces of the United States for Operation Atlantic Resolve in the area of responsibility of the United States European Command. This order authorizes the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security (for the Coast Guard) to activate units and individual members who are not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit of the Selected Reserve or are in the Individual Ready Reserve mobilization category. The total number of members activated should not exceed 3,000 at any one time, with a maximum of 450 members from the Individual Ready Reserve. The order also allows the termination of service for those units and members who have been activated. It should be noted that this order does not create any rights or benefits enforceable against the United States or any other party. The order was issued on July 13, 2023.
