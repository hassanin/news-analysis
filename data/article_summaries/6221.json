The article discusses the potential consequences of the Default on America Act, a bill proposed by Congressional Republicans. The bill includes devastating cuts that would negatively impact veterans' healthcare, raise costs for families, and hinder economic growth. It would also result in the loss of healthcare coverage for millions of Americans and the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs. Economists predict that if enacted, the bill would increase the likelihood of a recession and lead to 780,000 fewer jobs by 2024. The article highlights the contrast between the Default on America Act and President Biden's Budget, which focuses on investing in America, reducing costs for families, protecting Medicare and Social Security, and lowering the deficit by $3 trillion over 10 years. The White House has released fact sheets detailing the harmful effects of the bill on states and the District of Columbia, including jeopardizing transportation safety and infrastructure, increasing costs for families, harming seniors and veterans, and undermining education and job training.
