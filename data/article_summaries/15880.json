During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney highlights the positive effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on reducing healthcare costs. Carney mentions that growth in healthcare costs is at historically low levels, with health care spending growing at the slowest rate on record over the last three years. He also notes that the ACA is contributing to this progress through provisions that reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare. Carney also discusses the recent job creation numbers and emphasizes the President's commitment to further job growth and reducing inequality. He mentions the need for Congress to extend unemployment insurance and encourages them to act on this issue. Carney also addresses questions about the President's plans to attend Nelson Mandela's memorial events, the progress of budget negotiations, and the President's views on NSA surveillance.
