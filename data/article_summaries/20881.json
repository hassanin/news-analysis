The White House is disappointed that Senate Republicans have blocked the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The convention would not require any changes to US law, as the country already leads in promoting and protecting the rights of persons with disabilities. However, ratifying the convention would allow the US to support extending these rights globally, improving the lives of Americans with disabilities who wish to live, work, and travel abroad. It would also level the playing field for businesses and reaffirm American leadership on disability rights. Democrats, Republicans, disability advocacy groups, wounded warriors, veterans groups, and business groups have all supported the treaty. The White House hopes the Senate will reconsider the treaty in the next Congress.
