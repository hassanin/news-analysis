Paul Miller, a staffer at the White House and a leader in the disability rights movement, has passed away. Despite being told "you can't," Paul proved the opposite throughout his life. He was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Law School, and went on to become a law professor, disability law expert, and one of the longest-serving commissioners of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He also advised President Bill Clinton and later became an invaluable advisor to the current President. However, what truly mattered to Paul was the work he did to create a fairer and more equal world, where everyone has the freedom to pursue their happiness. His wife, Jennifer, his daughters, Naomi and Delia, and all those whose lives he touched are in the thoughts and prayers of the President.
