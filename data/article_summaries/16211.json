The President praises Congress for passing the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act, which allows Americans to use their phones on any network they choose. The President's administration worked with the FCC, industry, and wireless carriers to ensure copyright law does not hinder wireless competition. This bill gives ordinary Americans more flexibility and choice in selecting a cell phone carrier. The President commends the leaders in Congress who worked on this issue and looks forward to signing the bill into law.
