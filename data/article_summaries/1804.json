The Departments of Energy, Interior, Commerce, and Transportation in the United States have launched initiatives to develop floating offshore wind platforms. These initiatives aim to deploy 15 gigawatts (GW) of floating offshore wind by 2035, which would power 5 million homes and lower costs by 70%. The actions are part of President Biden's clean energy agenda, and they are expected to create jobs, reduce energy costs, and strengthen energy security. Currently, most offshore wind turbines are secured to the sea floor in shallow waters, but the new initiatives will focus on deep-water areas that require floating platforms. This will allow the US to tap into its vast offshore wind energy potential and position itself as a leader in floating offshore wind technology. The initiatives include the Floating Offshore Wind Shot, which aims to reduce the cost of floating offshore wind energy by over 70% by 2035, and a goal to deploy 15 GW of installed floating offshore wind capacity by 2035. The initiatives will also prioritize environmental justice, biodiversity protection, and ocean co-use. To support these goals, the Department of Energy has announced nearly $50 million in research, development, and demonstration funding.
