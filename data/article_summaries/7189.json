Fifty years ago, Congresswoman Patsy Takemoto Mink led the effort to pass Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in education programs receiving federal assistance. Title IX has resulted in significant progress in narrowing gender gaps in sports, expanding opportunities in science and technology fields, and protecting students from sex discrimination and harassment. However, there is still work to be done to achieve full equality and inclusion for women, girls, LGBTQI+ individuals, and all students. The administration remains committed to fighting for equal educational opportunities and ensuring that every person can pursue their education free from discrimination.
