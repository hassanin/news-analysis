On the anniversary of the attack on the U.S. Marine Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, President Obama issued a statement to honor the 241 service members who lost their lives in the attack. The attack, carried out by Hizballah suicide bombers, was the deadliest single-day death toll for the U.S. Marine Corps since World War II. The Marines were in Beirut as part of a multinational force to bring stability to the region and defend U.S. strategic interests in the Middle East. The President expressed gratitude for the sacrifices made by service members and their commitment to defending the nation and promoting freedom and security worldwide. He also reiterated the commitment to promoting Lebanon's stability, sovereignty, and independence, and supporting the Lebanese people in forming a government that reflects their aspirations.
