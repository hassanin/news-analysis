The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to engage key communities with high numbers of uninsured individuals in states across the country. The goal is to help these communities reach and enroll the remaining uninsured population. At the end of the open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of new signups in each participating community to the estimated number of eligible uninsured people at the start of enrollment.
