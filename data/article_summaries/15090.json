The United States plans to commit approximately $190 million in new assistance to support Ukraine's reform agenda. This assistance package aims to fight corruption, attract investment, promote economic growth, strengthen energy security, and build a long-term democratic foundation. The funds will also support civil society, independent media, and the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in eastern Ukraine. Including this new commitment, the United States has provided $2 billion in loan guarantees and almost $760 million in security, programmatic, and technical assistance to Ukraine since 2014. The administration will continue to work with Congress and international partners to support Ukraine's sovereignty, economy, and reform agenda.
