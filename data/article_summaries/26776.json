President Trump and VA Secretary Dr. David Shulkin have announced three initiatives aimed at expanding access to healthcare for veterans across the country. The initiatives will use telehealth technology and mobile applications to connect with more veterans and provide services where they live. This will be particularly beneficial for veterans in rural areas who may be far away from a VA medical facility. The VA already has the largest telehealth program in the country, with 700,000 veterans receiving telehealth services last year. The new initiatives include an "Anywhere to Anywhere VA Health Care" initiative that allows VA providers to serve veterans no matter where they are located, a new application called VA Video Connect that allows veterans to connect with their VA providers via video on their mobile phones or computers, and an application called Veteran Appointment Request that makes it easier for veterans to schedule or change appointments with the VA. These initiatives aim to remove barriers and speed up access to healthcare for veterans.
