The White House has released a message to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan will continue beyond November 3, 2013. This emergency was initially declared in 1997 due to the actions and policies of the Sudanese government that are considered hostile to US interests and pose a threat to national security. The President has determined that it is necessary to maintain sanctions against Sudan in order to address this threat.
