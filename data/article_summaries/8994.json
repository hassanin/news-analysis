The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating consequences worldwide, causing millions of deaths and significant economic losses. It has exposed weaknesses in local, national, and international health systems and highlighted the need for better health security. The Biden-Harris administration has made progress in combating COVID-19 and improving health security, but more needs to be done to prevent future pandemics. The FY23 President's Budget includes a historic $88.2 billion request for funding across various government departments to prepare for future biological threats. These investments aim to enhance capabilities in preventing, detecting, and responding to emerging biological catastrophes. The budget will also focus on preparing for future COVID-19 variants and ensuring that the capabilities developed to combat the current pandemic are sustained for future outbreaks. The White House has launched the Pandemic Innovation Task Force to accelerate innovations that can improve our response to COVID-19 and future biological threats. These efforts will strengthen international systems for early threat detection and rapid response and help the nation learn from the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic.
