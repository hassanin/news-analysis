In a speech at the Rehoboth Beach Convention Center in Delaware, President Biden announced that the U.S. economy added 559,000 new jobs in May, bringing the total number of jobs created since he took office to over 2 million. The unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent, the lowest since the start of the pandemic, and wages increased for American workers. Biden highlighted the progress made in combating long-term unemployment and the increase in vaccination rates, which have contributed to the economic recovery. He also mentioned that the U.S. economy is projected to grow at a rate of 6.9 percent in 2021, the fastest pace in almost four decades. Biden attributed this success to the cooperation of the American people in following COVID-19 safety measures and the passage of the American Rescue Plan, which provided resources for vaccinations and economic relief. He emphasized that the country is on the right track but acknowledged that there may be challenges ahead. Biden concluded by expressing optimism and highlighting his proposed American Jobs Plan and American Family Plan as generational investments for continued success.
