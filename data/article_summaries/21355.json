President Barack Obama has proclaimed October 9th as Leif Erikson Day in the United States. Leif Erikson, a son of Iceland and grandson of Norway, was the first European known to have landed on North American shores. This day is meant to honor Erikson and his crew for their bold and perilous voyage, as well as to celebrate the friendship between Norway and the United States. The proclamation also recognizes the role of Norwegian immigrants in shaping America's immigrant legacy. President Obama calls on all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor Nordic-American heritage.
