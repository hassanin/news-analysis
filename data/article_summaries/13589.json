In this press gaggle, Press Secretary Jay Carney and OMB Deputy Director for Management Jeff Zients discuss the President's proposal to request consolidation authority from Congress in order to make the government more efficient and effective. The President is asking for the reinstatement of authority that past presidents had for over 50 years, which is the ability to submit proposals for a fast-track up or down vote on consolidating government agencies. The first proposal under this authority would be to consolidate six agencies focused on business and trade. The goal is to save money, reduce the size of government, and improve service. The President also plans to elevate the Small Business Administration (SBA) to Cabinet status. The SBA would then be represented in the new agency focused on business competitiveness. The proposal is expected to save $3 billion and make it easier for small businesses to access government services. The press gaggle also briefly touches on the issue of Iran and the Strait of Hormuz, as well as the release of prisoners in Myanmar.
