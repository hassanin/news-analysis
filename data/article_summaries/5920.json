On Monday, the President will host a bipartisan bill signing ceremony for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This landmark economic growth bill aims to rebuild the middle class and deliver significant benefits for American families. The President will be joined by Members of Congress who played a role in drafting the bill, as well as a diverse group of leaders who advocated for its passage, including Governors, Mayors, labor union representatives, and business leaders.

During the signing ceremony, the President will emphasize his commitment to rebuilding the middle class and highlight the historic benefits that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will bring. These benefits include the creation of millions of good-paying, union jobs for working people, improvements in ports and transportation systems to strengthen supply chains, the provision of high-speed internet access for all Americans, access to clean water for children and families, significant investments in roads and bridges, the largest investment ever in mass transit, and unprecedented investments in clean energy infrastructure.

In the coming weeks, the President, Vice President, and Cabinet members will travel across the country to communicate how the law will benefit communities, stimulate economic growth, and position America to compete in the 21st century.
