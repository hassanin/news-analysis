The White House released a statement from Christina Romer, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, on the Fourth Quarter 2008 Advance GDP Estimate. The statement reveals that real GDP fell at an annual rate of 3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008, marking the largest one-quarter fall since 1982 and the second consecutive quarter of decline. The decline in GDP was spread across the economy, with personal consumption expenditures, nonresidential fixed investment, and exports all experiencing significant decreases. The decline in motor vehicle output was particularly severe, contributing to 2.0 percentage points of the overall fall in GDP. This statement highlights the need for aggressive and well-designed fiscal stimulus to reverse the decline and promote economic recovery and long-term growth. Immediate action to support the financial sector and overall demand is deemed essential.
