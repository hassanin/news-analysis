The Biden-Harris Administration has launched a website called Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation, which provides communities with real-time information on extreme weather and other hazards related to climate change. The website includes interactive maps that show how each community could be impacted in the future. The goal is to help state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments better track climate impacts and access federal resources for long-term planning. The website also brings together federal information sources and funding opportunities to help communities prepare for and respond to climate impacts. It is part of the Administration's efforts to make America more resilient to climate change. The website is a result of a National Climate Task Force initiative and integrates data from various federal initiatives. The Biden-Harris Administration has secured historic investments to enhance the nation's climate mapping and data capabilities.
