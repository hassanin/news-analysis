President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New York and authorized federal aid to assist in recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, and straight-line winds that occurred on September 16, 2010. The funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in Kings, Queens, and Richmond counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding. Philip E. Parr has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-3272.
