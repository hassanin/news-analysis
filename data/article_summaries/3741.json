In her speech in Cairo, Egypt, the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Biden, expressed her gratitude for being welcomed at Al-Azhar and thanked the Grand Imam and other dignitaries present. She shared that she teaches writing at a community college and uses two assignments to connect with her students. The first assignment is inspired by a poem called "Where I'm From," where students share their experiences and memories that have shaped them. The second assignment is based on a show called "This I Believe," where students share their deeply held beliefs. Mrs. Biden believes that the youth of Egypt, like their peers around the world, are the future and also the present. She believes in their potential to bring new ideas and innovations to fields such as medicine, clean energy, technology, and art. Mrs. Biden also emphasized the importance of understanding each other, finding common ground, and fostering people-to-people connections between the United States and Egypt. She expressed her commitment to listening to the stories of the Egyptian people and taking them back to the United States. The speech concluded with gratitude to Dr. Makhlouf for moderating the discussion.
