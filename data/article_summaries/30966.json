On January 19, 2021, an executive order was issued by President Donald Trump regarding veterans. The order directed the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to consider designating veterans who served on active duty in Uzbekistan between October 1, 2001, and December 31, 2005, as veterans who served on active duty in a theater of combat operations. 

Additionally, within 365 days of the order, the Secretary of Defense was instructed to conduct a study investigating toxic exposure by members of the Armed Forces deployed to the Karshi-Khanabad Air Base in Uzbekistan between October 1, 2001, and December 31, 2005. The study was required to assess the conditions at the Air Base during that period, identify any toxic substances contaminating the base, determine the exposure time frames and locations, identify the service members exposed, and examine the circumstances of exposure. It also called for an epidemiological study to analyze any health consequences for the deployed personnel and assess any causal link between exposure to toxic substances and the health consequences.

The executive order included general provisions stating that it should be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It also clarified that the order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.

This executive order was issued by President Donald Trump on his last day in office.
