The article is a press briefing by Tony Blinken, the national security advisor to the Vice President, on the Vice President's upcoming trip to Ukraine and Georgia. The Vice President will be accompanied by a strong interagency team and will have a busy schedule in both countries. The main purpose of the trip is to strengthen the partnerships with Ukraine and Georgia and discuss concrete steps to deepen the partnerships. The Vice President will also restate the US commitment to not let its efforts to reset relations with Russia come at the expense of any other country. In Ukraine, the Vice President will meet with President Yushchenko, Prime Minister Tymoshenko, and other leaders. In Georgia, he will meet with President Saakashvili, opposition leaders, and deliver a speech to the Parliament. The Vice President will also address the energy sector in both countries and the importance of democracy and stability. The US is open to helping Ukraine with its energy needs and is working with Georgia on defense reform and modernization. The US does not see a repeat of the conflict between Russia and Georgia last year and believes that peace and restraint are the best path forward.
