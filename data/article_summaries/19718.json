The White House has issued a fact sheet outlining a request for emergency supplemental funding to address the increase in child and adult migration from Central America in the Rio Grande Valley areas of the Southwest border. The administration is responding to this urgent humanitarian situation with a whole-of-government approach, including deploying additional enforcement resources and working with international partners to address the root causes of migration. The request for a $3.7 billion supplemental appropriation is focused on deterrence, enforcement, foreign cooperation, and capacity. The funding would be allocated to various departments and programs, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The goal is to ensure that cases are processed fairly and as quickly as possible, while also addressing the underlying security and economic issues that cause migration. Without supplemental funding, agencies will not have sufficient resources to adequately address the situation.
