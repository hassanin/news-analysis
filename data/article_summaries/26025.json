On October 14, 2019, President Donald J. Trump issued executive orders related to foreign policy. The orders were issued in response to the situation in Syria, specifically the military offensive conducted by the Government of Turkey in northeast Syria. The President declared a national emergency, stating that the actions of Turkey undermine the campaign to defeat ISIS, endanger civilians, and threaten peace, security, and stability in the region. The executive orders include provisions to block the property and interests in property of individuals and entities involved in actions that threaten Syria's peace and security or commit serious human rights abuses. They also authorize the imposition of sanctions on foreign persons who obstruct ceasefires, prevent displaced persons from returning to Syria, or impede efforts to promote a political solution to the conflict. The orders further suspend the entry of certain individuals into the United States and prohibit the making of donations to blocked persons. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to implement these orders.
