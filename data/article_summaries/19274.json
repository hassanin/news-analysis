On the International Day for the Victims of Enforced Disappearances, National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice issued a statement expressing solidarity with individuals who have been abducted and detained in secret by their own governments. She highlighted that repressive regimes resort to "disappearing" their critics when faced with citizens trying to hold them accountable. Rice called for independent and transparent investigations into these cases to remove obstacles and bring closure to families who have lost loved ones. She noted that enforced disappearances have been on the rise, particularly in conflict and repression situations, citing examples from Syria, Egypt, North Korea, Eritrea, and Zimbabwe. The United States urges all countries to end enforced disappearances and hold those responsible accountable.
