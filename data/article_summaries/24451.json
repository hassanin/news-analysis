In this article, President Obama calls on Congress to pass the Veterans Job Corps legislation and announces a new initiative to help service members gain civilian credentials and licenses. The President will visit Honeywell's Golden Valley facility in Minnesota to address these issues. The Department of Defense has established a Military Credentialing and Licensing Task Force to focus on industries that need skilled workers, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and information technology. The Task Force will work with credentialing associations to bridge the gap between military training and civilian requirements. The President's announcement will provide opportunities for up to 126,000 service members to gain industry-recognized certifications for manufacturing jobs. The Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps have partnered with credentialing agencies to expand certifications to military personnel. The partnerships will allow service members to earn civilian credentials immediately after completing their military training. The President also emphasizes the need for Congress to pass the Veterans Job Corps, which aims to put veterans back to work in various roles, including as cops, firefighters, and first responders.
