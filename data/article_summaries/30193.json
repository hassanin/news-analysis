President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation recognizing the importance of apprenticeships in the American workforce. He highlights the need for affordable education and training opportunities that lead to stable, well-paying jobs, as the existing higher education system may not always provide the right forms of training. The cost of college is rising, making it inaccessible for many and burdening others with student debt. Apprenticeships offer an alternative path to high-paying jobs by providing real-world skills and a paycheck. Research suggests that graduates of apprenticeship programs earn $300,000 more throughout their lifetime than non-apprentices in the same field. The Trump administration has taken steps to promote and expand apprenticeships, directing the Department of Labor to work with other federal departments and agencies to make it easier for companies to create and grow apprenticeship programs. The administration also encourages businesses, educational institutions, and government entities to expand apprenticeship opportunities and other quality job-training programs. In recognition of the importance of apprenticeships, November 13 to 19, 2017, has been proclaimed as National Apprenticeship Week.
