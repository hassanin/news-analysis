Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building about the issue of appraisal bias in the home valuation system. She highlighted the historical inequities faced by communities of color in accessing homeownership and how this continues today through undervaluation of their homes. Harris announced the release of the Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) Action Plan, which includes measures to address bias in home appraisals. These measures include requiring appraisers to undergo anti-bias fair housing and fair lending training, expanding the training pipeline for new appraisers, and developing rules to eliminate bias in appraisal algorithms. The administration also released a resource guide for homeowners and homebuyers to challenge biased appraisals and launched a public awareness campaign. Harris emphasized the importance of homeownership as a pathway to financial security and intergenerational wealth and expressed the administration's commitment to ensuring fairness in the home valuation system.
