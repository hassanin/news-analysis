First Lady Michelle Obama will host a farm-to-table luncheon for the spouses of Chiefs of State and Heads of Government attending the United Nations General Assembly. The luncheon will take place at the Stone Barns Center, a non-profit farm and education center near New York City. The visiting spouses will have the opportunity to tour the farm and learn about its sustainable food production practices. The luncheon will feature ingredients sourced from the farm, and Mrs. Obama will deliver a speech before the meal. The Stone Barns Center aims to promote community-based food production and educate people about healthier and more sustainable ways of growing food. This event follows previous initiatives by Mrs. Obama to promote sustainable agriculture, including hosting dinners at a working farm and starting a garden at the White House.
