President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on August 29, 2018, regarding the adjustment of imports of steel articles into the United States. The Secretary of Commerce had previously determined that steel articles were being imported in quantities and under circumstances that threatened to impair national security. In response, President Trump imposed a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on steel articles imported from most countries. However, he also authorized the Secretary to provide relief from these additional duties for steel articles that are not produced in sufficient quantities domestically or for specific national security considerations. The proclamation also grants relief from quantitative limitations on steel articles in certain circumstances where the limits have already been reached, to prevent disruption or delay of projects in the United States. The proclamation maintains the current tariff and quota levels and authorizes the Secretary to exclude steel articles from import restrictions based on lack of domestic production or specific national security considerations. The President also stated that discussions are ongoing with other countries to find alternative means to address the national security concerns posed by steel imports.
