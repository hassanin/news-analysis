First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden have announced that all 50 states have taken action on military spouse licensing as part of their Joining Forces initiative. The initiative, launched in 2011, aims to rally Americans around servicemembers, veterans, and their families by providing wellness, education, and employment opportunities. The goal of the military spouse licensing action is to make it easier for military spouses to continue their careers despite frequent moves. On average, military spouses seek new employment every 1-3 years due to their spouses' orders. About 35% of military spouses work in occupations that require a professional license, which necessitates re-credentialing with each move. The ability of military spouses to maintain a career has a significant impact on the decision of service members to remain in the military. All 50 states have now implemented measures to support military spouses in obtaining and transferring licenses across state lines. While progress has been made, there are still challenges and gaps that need to be addressed, particularly in the education sector. The initiative also aims to increase employment opportunities for veterans and military spouses, with over 1.2 million veterans and military spouses hired or trained as a result of ongoing outreach. The ultimate goal is to ensure that every veteran and military spouse who wants a job can find one. Joining Forces celebrated its five-year anniversary and has gained support from various sectors, including businesses, non-profits, hospitals, universities, and celebrities. The initiative aims to create a better understanding of the sacrifices and challenges facing military families and encourage communities to connect with and support them.
