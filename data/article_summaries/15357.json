In this letter, President Barack Obama is requesting Congress to consider an amendment to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 proposals in his FY 2011 Budget. Specifically, he is asking for authority to transfer up to $50 million of expiring funds from the Department of Defense to the Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration for improvements to the Port of Guam. The modernization of the port is crucial for the military construction program that supports the realignment of U.S. Marine Corps forces from Japan to Guam, which is part of the overall U.S. strategy for military forces in the Pacific region. The letter also mentions a FY 2010 proposal for the Legislative Branch, which is transmitted without any changes as a matter of comity between branches. The details of the amendment can be found in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
