President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Alaska due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. Federal funding is now available for emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance, for all areas in Alaska impacted by COVID-19. Michael F. O'Hare has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further assessments.
