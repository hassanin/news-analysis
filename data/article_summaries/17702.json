The White House is providing a fact sheet on international support for Ukraine. The United States is committed to supporting the Government of Ukraine economically and is working with international partners to develop an assistance package. The goal is to provide rapid financial and technical assistance to help Ukraine restore economic stability and conduct free, fair, and inclusive elections. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is already engaged in stabilizing the Ukrainian economy and providing large-scale financing and technical support. The United States is also working with Congress to approve legislation that would support the IMF's capacity to lend additional resources to Ukraine. In addition, the United States is ready to provide loan guarantees and other financial and technical assistance to address Ukraine's most urgent needs, including economic reforms, conducting elections, combating corruption, and withstanding trade actions by Russia.
