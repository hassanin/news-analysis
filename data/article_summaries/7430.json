During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki introduced Daleep Singh, who announced a package of financial sanctions and export restrictions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions include freezing the assets of Russian banks and state-owned enterprises, imposing restrictions on U.S. investors, and targeting Russian elites involved in corruption. The goal is to isolate Russia from the global financial system and undermine Putin's strategic ambitions. The impact of these sanctions is expected to result in higher inflation, interest rates, and lower living standards in Russia. Psaki also addressed concerns about the impact on the U.S. economy and energy supply, stating that the sanctions were designed to minimize disruption. Additionally, Psaki provided updates on President Biden's activities and engagement with world leaders, including calls with President Zelensky and congressional leaders. The briefing also touched on other topics such as humanitarian assistance, potential cyberattacks, dissent within Russia, and the State of the Union address. Psaki responded to questions about the effectiveness of the sanctions, the timeline for results, and the possibility of a no-fly zone over Ukraine. She also addressed concerns about nuclear weapons, the readiness of the Ukrainian government, and the potential acceptance of Ukrainian refugees. Psaki ended the briefing by addressing remarks made by Senator Ted Cruz during a CPAC event.
