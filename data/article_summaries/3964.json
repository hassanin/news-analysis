The article condemns the recent Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia's civil infrastructure, including oil storage facilities and civil facilities in various cities. These attacks are seen as acts of terrorism aimed at prolonging the suffering of the Yemeni people. The article accuses Iran of enabling these attacks, in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni Government have endorsed UN calls for ceasefires and de-escalation, but the Houthis continue to reject them and respond with terrorist acts and military offensives. The article emphasizes the need to end the war and provide relief to the Yemeni people, but states that this can only happen if the Houthis cooperate with the United Nations and its envoy in de-escalating the conflict. The United States expresses its full support for these efforts and calls on the international community to do the same.
