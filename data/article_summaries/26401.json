The President of the United States congratulates the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) for being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in combating hunger and contributing to peace in conflict-affected areas. The WFP is known for being the first agency to provide aid in communities affected by conflicts or natural disasters, and they continue their work until these communities can sustain themselves. The WFP assisted nearly 100 million people last year and serves as a model for the humanitarian community. The WFP was founded in 1961 at the request of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the United States has played a significant role in managing and financing the organization, being its largest contributor. The American people are proud supporters of the WFP.
