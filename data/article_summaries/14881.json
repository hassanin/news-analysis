President Barack Obama issued a statement expressing his satisfaction with the Senate's vote for cloture on the unemployment insurance extension. He emphasized the importance of this extension for millions of Americans who are facing difficulties finding employment and providing for their families during the tough economic times. President Obama criticized the partisan minority that had previously blocked this aid and commended the Senate for moving forward and restoring benefits to those affected. He pledged to continue fighting for economic policies that will lead the country out of the recession, urging Congress to act on proposals such as a small business jobs bill, aid for struggling states to prevent layoffs, and tax cuts for middle-class families. The President stressed that Americans who are struggling to find employment deserve more than political game-playing and failed policies, and he expressed his gratitude to the Senators who supported the working families in this vote.
