President Biden has announced a plan to expand health coverage for DACA recipients. Under the proposed rule, DACA recipients would be able to enroll in Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Programs, and the Affordable Care Act's Health Insurance Marketplaces. They may also qualify for financial assistance based on income. President Biden believes that DACA recipients contribute to the economy and enrich communities, and he has called on Congress to give them a pathway to citizenship. While Congress has not acted, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to protect Dreamers. Congressional leaders, state and local leaders, and advocacy organizations have applauded the plan. They believe that DACA recipients deserve access to healthcare and that this expansion is a significant step toward healthcare equity for all.
