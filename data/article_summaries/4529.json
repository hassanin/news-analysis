President Biden's Safer America Plan aims to make communities safer by investing in community policing, crime prevention, mental health and substance use treatment services, crisis responders, and social workers. The plan includes funding for police officers to improve accountability and build community trust, as well as measures to enforce gun laws and ban assault weapons. The plan also focuses on clearing court backlogs, addressing emerging crime trends, and promoting criminal justice reform. Additionally, it seeks to keep dangerous guns out of the hands of criminals through enhanced background checks and cracking down on gun traffickers.
