President Donald Trump issued an executive order on September 13, 2017, regarding the proposed acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation by Canyon Bridge Merger Sub, Inc. and its parent companies. The order states that there is credible evidence suggesting that the acquisition could potentially threaten the national security of the United States. As a result, the executive order prohibits the proposed transaction and any substantially equivalent transaction. The Purchasers and Lattice are instructed to fully and permanently abandon the proposed transaction within 30 days, unless an extension is granted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The order also requires the Purchasers and Lattice to provide weekly certifications of compliance with the order until the proposed transaction is terminated. Any attempts to avoid or circumvent this order are prohibited, and the Attorney General is authorized to enforce it. The President reserves the right to issue further orders if necessary to protect national security. The order will be published in the Federal Register, and the Secretary of the Treasury is directed to transmit a copy of the order to the parties involved in the proposed transaction.
