President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to the Central African Republic, which was declared in Executive Order 13667 in 2014, is to continue beyond May 12, 2021. The Central African Republic has been experiencing a breakdown of law and order, sectarian tension, widespread violence, and the forced recruitment and use of child soldiers. These issues pose a threat to the peace, security, and stability of the Central African Republic and neighboring states, as well as the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
