The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released the final data on drug overdose deaths for 2019 in the United States. The report shows an overall increase in drug-related poisonings, mainly due to increased fentanyl, stimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine, and multiple drug involvement. However, there has been a continued decrease in opioid-related overdose deaths involving heroin, as well as natural and semi-synthetic opioids. Specifically, overdoses involving prescription opioids like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine declined by five percent in 2019 compared to 2018. This decline is significant and positive. The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), Jim Carroll, highlighted the impact of illicit substance combinations and the smuggling of lethal methamphetamine from Mexico. He emphasized the need for continued vigilance at the nation's borders to prevent the entry of illegal substances. Despite the grim overall numbers, there is hope in the decreasing opioid-related deaths that exclude fentanyl. The ONDCP aims to tackle the opioid crisis and other deadly synthetics by applying a whole-of-government approach and connecting individuals with substance use disorder to treatment and hope. The CDC's data is sourced from the Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database, which provides valuable information for public health research and decision making.
