Vice President Biden had a call with Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, where they discussed the situation in eastern Ukraine. They agreed that the Ukrainian government had made progress in implementing the Geneva Joint Statement by reaching out to citizens in the region, proposing an amnesty for protestors, and working with the OSCE to promote dialogue. However, they noted that Russia had not fulfilled any of its commitments from the Geneva agreement. They also discussed the possibility of imposing further costs on Russia if it continued its destabilizing actions in Ukraine. The Vice President emphasized that if Russia intervened militarily, the United States and its partners should be prepared to impose sanctions on certain sectors of the Russian economy.
