This article is a memorandum issued by President Barack Obama, outlining his directive to make it easier for small businesses and exporters to access government services in order to help them grow and hire. The President emphasizes the need for a government that efficiently supports American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. He calls for a "No Wrong Door" policy, using technology to connect businesses to relevant services and information. The memorandum directs executive departments and agencies to work with a Steering Committee to create a common, open, online platform called BusinessUSA, which will disseminate core information about government programs and services for small businesses and exporters. The platform will be designed with the active feedback of businesses and online communities, and will integrate related state and local government services as well as private sector partners. Agencies are also instructed to make their small business and export programs and services accessible through BusinessUSA, using common standards for content. The Steering Committee will develop new content that synthesizes information from multiple agencies to better serve small businesses and exporters. BusinessUSA will be integrated into current websites, call centers, and field offices of agencies, and a centralized call center will be enhanced to provide expertise on government programs and services for small businesses and exporters. The memorandum also addresses the operation and funding of BusinessUSA, and states that it should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
