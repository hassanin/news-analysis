The US Department of Justice has taken custody of Ovidio Guzman Lopez, the son of notorious drug lord "El Chapo," who is wanted for drug trafficking, money laundering, and other violent crimes. This extradition demonstrates the ongoing cooperation between the US and Mexican governments in combating narcotics and other challenges. The US also acknowledges the sacrifices made by law enforcement officials and service members in ensuring accountability and justice for those who break the law. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to use all available resources to aggressively counter the deadly impact of fentanyl and other narcotics on American citizens.
