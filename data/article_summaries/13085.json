First Lady Michelle Obama is inviting children from across the country to join her for the fourth annual White House Kitchen Garden spring planting. This initiative, started in 2009, aims to promote the health of the nation's children. Mrs. Obama has invited local school children in Washington D.C. to participate in the planting and harvesting of the garden, and this year she has also invited children from Iowa, New York, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania who wrote to her about their own gardening experiences. The children come from various schools and organizations, such as Girl Scouts of Western New York, Harriet Tubman and Bancroft Elementary Schools, Mitchell Elementary School, Stetser Elementary School, and Sumner Elementary School. These children have expressed their enthusiasm for healthy eating, physical activity, and community gardening.
