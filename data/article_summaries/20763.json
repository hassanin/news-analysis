On October 24, 2009, President Barack Obama declared a national emergency in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The Secretary of Health and Human Services had previously declared a public health emergency in April 2009 and renewed it twice. Despite efforts to reduce the impact of the pandemic, rates of illness were still rising rapidly across the nation, and there was concern that healthcare resources could become overburdened. In order to facilitate the response to the pandemic, certain federal requirements were temporarily waived or modified for healthcare facilities. The Secretary was given the authority to exercise this power and was required to provide certification and advance notice to Congress.
