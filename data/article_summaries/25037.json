The White House has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq. This emergency was first declared in 2003 due to the threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of peace and security, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in the country. The obstacles still exist and continue to pose a threat, so the national emergency will remain in effect for another year.
