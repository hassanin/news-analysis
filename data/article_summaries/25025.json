The article is a statement by the Vice President of the United States regarding a letter sent by 47 Republican Senators to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Vice President criticizes the letter, stating that it undermines the President's authority and threatens future negotiations with other nations. He argues that previous major foreign policy decisions, such as the recognition of China and the resolution of the Iran hostage crisis, were made without Congressional approval. The Vice President believes that a diplomatic solution is the best way to address the threat of Iran's nuclear program and that the letter is attempting to sabotage ongoing negotiations. He warns that if talks collapse due to Congressional intervention, it could lead to a nuclear-armed Iran and increased likelihood of military action. The President remains committed to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and believes that the current negotiations offer the best chance for a peaceful resolution.
