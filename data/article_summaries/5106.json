White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki provided updates on two key topics during a press briefing. First, she announced that President Biden will be hosting a meeting with private sector leaders on August 25th to discuss cybersecurity. The meeting will focus on improving the nation's cybersecurity in the face of escalating cyber threats. Second, Psaki shared that President Biden spoke with New York Governor Kathy Hochul prior to her being sworn in as governor of New York. They discussed their shared time at Syracuse University and Hochul expressed her desire to visit Washington to discuss infrastructure and improving the lives of New Yorkers. Psaki noted that the President looks forward to hosting her at a future date. Psaki also addressed questions about the ongoing situation in Afghanistan, including the Taliban's recent statement about barring Afghans from accessing roads leading to the airport. She clarified that the expectation is that individuals eligible for Special Immigrant Visas and others who are being facilitated for evacuation should be able to reach the airport. Psaki also reiterated that the August 31st deadline for the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan remains in place, but contingency plans are being developed in case adjustments to the timeline become necessary.
