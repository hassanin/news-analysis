The United States is taking steps to change its relationship with Cuba and engage with the Cuban people. The current policy of isolating Cuba has not been effective in promoting democracy and stability in the country. The new approach includes establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba and re-establishing an embassy in Havana. The United States will also adjust regulations to empower the Cuban people, facilitate travel and remittances, authorize the export of certain goods and services, and allow for increased communication between the United States and Cuba. The United States will continue to support human rights and democratic reforms in Cuba and encourage other countries to do the same. The ultimate goal is to empower the Cuban people to drive economic and political reforms in their country.
