The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) has been providing nutritionally balanced, low-cost or no-cost lunches to students since 1946. It plays a crucial role in promoting health, reducing child hunger, and supporting American agriculture. During the COVID-19 pandemic, school meals remained a consistent source of quality nutrition for millions of children who relied on them, even when businesses closed and people lost their jobs. The American Rescue Plan provided additional emergency food and nutrition assistance to help families struggling to provide meals for their children during the pandemic. The NSLP also recognizes the importance of partnering with local farmers to increase access to locally produced foods and support agricultural education for students. National School Lunch Week is a time to show appreciation to farmers and school nutrition professionals who work tirelessly to provide meals to students. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed October 10-16, 2021, as National School Lunch Week and encourages all Americans to recognize and commemorate the efforts of those involved in the NSLP.
