President Biden is scheduled to meet with Speaker McCarthy to discuss various issues. The President emphasizes that raising the debt ceiling is not up for negotiation, but rather an obligation to avoid economic chaos. He expects Congress to fulfill its duty as it has done in the past. In terms of the broader economic debate, Speaker McCarthy and his allies have expressed intentions to cut Social Security, Medicare, and other essential programs, while implementing a 30% national sales tax. President Biden is eager to learn more about these plans and share his own proposal to reduce the deficit, strengthen retirement programs, prioritize investments, and finance them by ensuring the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share. The President welcomes a clear debate on two different visions for the country, one that cuts Social Security and one that protects it.
