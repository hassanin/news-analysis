Harvard University's decision to welcome the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) back to its campus is seen as a positive step towards unity and recognizing the contributions of the military. The move comes after President Obama signed legislation ending "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and called on all college campuses to open their doors to military recruiters and the ROTC. This decision sends a powerful message that Americans stand united and that our society, colleges, and armed forces are stronger when we honor the sacrifices made by our troops and military families. It is seen as a move towards moving forward as one nation.
