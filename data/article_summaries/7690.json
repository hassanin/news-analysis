President Joe Biden has issued an executive order to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13959, which was issued in November 2020. The new order expands the scope of the national emergency to include the threat posed by the military-industrial complex of China and its involvement in military, intelligence, and security research and development programs. It also addresses the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside of China and its facilitation of repression or serious human rights abuses. The order prohibits the purchase or sale of publicly traded securities of any person listed in the Annex to the order or determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, to be subject to the order. The prohibitions take effect on August 2, 2021, for listed persons and 60 days after the determination for non-listed persons. The order allows for the divestment of securities prior to certain dates. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to carry out the order. The order also revokes Executive Order 13974 and replaces the Annex to Executive Order 13959.
