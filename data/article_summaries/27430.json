The 15th National Prescription Drug Take Back Day is being held on April 28, 2018. This event allows families to dispose of their expired or unused prescription drugs in an effort to prevent drug misuse. Last October's Take Back Day saw over 912,000 pounds of prescription drugs being returned. The disposal of prescription drugs is especially important for opioids, as overprescribing and stockpiling contribute to the opioid epidemic in the United States. Many people are unaware when they have been prescribed an opioid, and most people who abuse prescription opioids obtain them for free from friends or family. Leftover prescription drugs can also pose a danger to children if not stored securely. There are several ways to safely dispose of prescription drugs, including dropping them off at designated disposal sites, utilizing on-site drug disposal programs at retail pharmacies, or using mail-in disposal envelopes. Initiatives like Zero Left and National Prescription Drug Take Back Day aim to combat drug addiction and misuse in the United States.
