President Biden is commending Saudi Arabia's decision to open its airspace to all civilian carriers, including flights to and from Israel. This move is a result of the President's persistent diplomacy with Saudi Arabia and is seen as a step towards a more integrated, stable, and secure Middle East region. The President will address this breakthrough further during his historic flight from Israel to Saudi Arabia.
