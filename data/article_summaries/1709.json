President Biden gave a speech in the State Dining Room, discussing the progress of the American Rescue Plan. He announced that within the next 10 days, 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots will have been administered and 100 million relief checks will be distributed. The plan aims to make a difference in people's everyday lives by providing financial assistance, extending unemployment insurance, supporting small businesses, reopening schools safely, investing in childcare, providing food and nutrition assistance, expanding healthcare coverage, and reducing child poverty. Major economists support the plan, with Moody's estimating that it will create 7 million new jobs by the end of the year. President Biden emphasized the importance of implementing the plan efficiently and with accountability, mentioning his experience with the Recovery Act in 2009. He introduced Gene Sperling as the coordinator for implementing the American Rescue Plan and highlighted the need for communication, guidance, and accountability. President Biden concluded by expressing hope and emphasizing the government's responsibility to deliver for the American people. He also encouraged local doctors, preachers, and community members to promote the vaccine and continue wearing masks until everyone is vaccinated.
