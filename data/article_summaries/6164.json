On March 15, 1995, the President of the United States declared a national emergency regarding the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, citing threats to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. This declaration has been renewed annually since then, including the recent renewal on March 10, 2023. The actions and policies of the Iranian government, such as the development of missiles, support for terrorist groups, and regional aggression, continue to pose a significant threat to the United States. This national emergency is separate from the one declared in 1979 in connection with the hostage crisis. The notice of this renewal will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
