On December 20, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order on energy and environment, specifically addressing the United States' reliance on imports of certain mineral commodities. The order highlights the strategic vulnerability created by this dependency and aims to reduce the nation's reliance on these imports. The order defines "critical minerals" as non-fuel minerals that are essential to the economic and national security of the United States, have a vulnerable supply chain, and serve an essential function in manufacturing. The Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with other relevant departments and agencies, is tasked with publishing a list of critical minerals within 60 days of the order. The policy of the federal government is to identify new sources of critical minerals, increase activity in the supply chain, ensure access to advanced data, and streamline leasing and permitting processes. Within 180 days of the list's publication, the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with other departments and agencies, must submit a report to the President on reducing reliance on critical minerals, progress on recycling and reprocessing technologies, options for accessing and developing critical minerals through investment and trade, improving mapping data, and recommendations for streamlining permitting and review processes. The order does not impair existing authorities, functions, or treaties, and implementation is subject to applicable law and appropriations.
