The House has announced a resolution on the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), prompting support from a senator who has been a long-time advocate for the ERA. The senator emphasizes the importance of recognizing the will of the American people and ensuring gender equality is enshrined in the Constitution. They urge Congress to pass a resolution recognizing the ratification of the ERA, noting that a recent Office of Legal Counsel memorandum confirms that there are no obstacles preventing Congress from doing so. The senator emphasizes that discrimination based on sex should not be tolerated, and the nation must stand up for women's equality.
