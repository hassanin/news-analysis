The Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) was launched in 2014 to establish global capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats like Ebola. The GHSA aims to bring together nations from around the world to make commitments to advance global health security. Countries have developed 11 Action Packages to outline tangible steps required to prevent outbreaks, detect threats in real time, and respond to infectious disease threats. Since February, countries have made over 100 new commitments to implement the Action Packages. The United States has committed to assisting at least 30 countries over five years and has prioritized combating antibiotic resistant bacteria, improving biosafety and biosecurity, and preventing bioterrorism. Going forward, 10 countries will serve on the GHSA Steering Group to track progress and oversee implementation. An independent evaluation process will be needed to provide accountability and drive progress. The ultimate goal is to create a world safe and secure from all infectious disease threats.
