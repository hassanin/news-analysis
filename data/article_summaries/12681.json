President Obama will host the first-ever White House Maker Faire on June 18. The event will bring together students, entrepreneurs, and everyday citizens who are using new tools and techniques to launch businesses, learn STEM skills, and fuel American manufacturing. The President will also announce new steps the Administration is taking to support access to these tools and bring ideas to life. The rise of the Maker Movement, fueled by technologies like 3D printers and design software, presents a huge opportunity for the United States to boost innovation and entrepreneurship in manufacturing. June 18 will also be a nationwide Day of Making for communities across America to share and celebrate their involvement in the Maker Movement.
