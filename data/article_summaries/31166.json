President Donald J. Trump has announced his intent to nominate Christopher A. Wray for the position of Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Wray, currently a partner at King & Spalding law firm, is recognized for his expertise in white-collar criminal defense and government investigations. He previously served as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice from 2003 to 2005, where he played a key role in addressing corporate fraud scandals. Wray received the Edmund J. Randolph Award, the Department's highest honor for public service and leadership, upon his departure. If confirmed by the Senate, Wray will lead the FBI with integrity and continue to protect the country.
