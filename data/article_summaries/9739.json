The White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, held a press briefing to address concerns about the government shutdown and the debt ceiling. He emphasized that it would be bad for the economy and the middle class if the government were to shut down, and urged the House to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government open while negotiations continue. Carney also stated that the White House would not support repealing the tax on medical devices and that the Affordable Care Act would not be delayed or defunded. He emphasized that the President will not negotiate over Congress's responsibility to raise the debt ceiling and warned of the dire consequences of defaulting on the country's debts. Carney also discussed the progress being made on the Syrian chemical weapons issue and the President's upcoming trip to Asia. Finally, he addressed concerns about delays in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stating that the small business website and the Spanish-language online enrollment would be delayed, but that the overall implementation was on track.
