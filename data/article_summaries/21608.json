The article discusses President Obama's plan to improve the fuel efficiency of American trucks. The President has directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) to develop and issue the next phase of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles by March 2016. This second round of standards will build on the first-ever standards for these vehicles, which will save vehicle owners and operators an estimated $50 billion in fuel costs and save 530 million barrels of oil. The President is also partnering with private-sector leaders to deploy advanced vehicles and expand fuel choices for American drivers. Additionally, the President is working with manufacturers to support innovation for the next generation of trucks. The article also mentions the President's efforts to establish an Energy Security Trust Fund to fund research and development for advanced vehicle technologies and his proposal to support investment in advanced vehicles and infrastructure through a new tax credit and an extension of tax credits to support cellulosic biofuels.
