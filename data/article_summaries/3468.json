On November 14, 1979, President Biden issued Executive Order 12170, declaring a national emergency with respect to Iran due to the threat it posed to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This national emergency has not yet been resolved, and the process of implementing agreements with Iran is still ongoing. Therefore, President Biden has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. It should be noted that this declaration is separate from the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 in 1995. The announcement has been published in the Federal Register and will be transmitted to Congress.
