The President of the United States has submitted an alternative plan for pay adjustments for civilian Federal employees in January 2021. The plan aims to limit pay increases for these employees due to concerns about the fiscal sustainability of current increases. Under the current law, locality pay increases averaging 20.67 percent would go into effect in addition to a 2.5 percent across-the-board increase for the base General Schedule. However, the President has determined that the across-the-board base pay increase will be limited to 1.0 percent for 2021 and locality pay percentages will remain at their 2020 levels. The President's plan also emphasizes the need for pay system reforms to align with recruitment and retention goals and to reward employees based on performance. The adjustment will take effect in January 2021.
