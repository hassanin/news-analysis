The President visited the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Arvada, Colorado and mentioned that offshore wind turbines will be twice as big as the ones currently in use. He also noted that the laboratory has expanded since his last visit in 2011 and that they have successfully brought down the cost of energy generated by wind and solar. When asked about signing a reconciliation package with slimmed-down climate measures, the President expressed support for more climate measures.
