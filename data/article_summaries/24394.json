President Barack Obama has proclaimed September as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month in the United States. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the country. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of raising awareness and supporting research to improve detection and treatment of the disease. Certain factors, such as age, race, and family history, may increase the likelihood of developing prostate cancer, with African American men being at a higher risk. The government, through organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense, and the National Cancer Institute, continues to support research and education efforts. The Affordable Care Act also expands coverage and provides greater freedom and control over healthcare choices, benefiting cancer patients. The proclamation urges citizens, government agencies, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other groups to participate in activities that promote awareness and prevention of prostate cancer.
