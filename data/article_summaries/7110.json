President Biden spoke at Jones Elementary School in Joliet, Illinois, emphasizing the importance of Social Security and Medicare. He praised the members of Congress, including Senator Dick Durbin and Senator Tammy Duckworth, for their support in protecting and strengthening these programs. Biden highlighted the struggles of everyday Americans and the need for affordable healthcare, particularly for seniors. He discussed the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which allows Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices and caps out-of-pocket expenses for seniors. He also mentioned the upcoming increase in Social Security checks and the affordability of hearing aids and insulin for seniors. However, Biden warned about Republican efforts to repeal these programs and called on the American people to vote and protect their benefits. He criticized Republicans for prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations over the needs of the American people. Biden urged the audience to spread the message and have faith in the future of America.
