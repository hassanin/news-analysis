This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on January 18, 2021, aims to address the issue of democratic accountability within federal agencies. The order states that some agencies have allowed career officials to have the final say on regulations, which undermines the power of the American people to choose their government officials. To address this, the order requires that agency rules must be signed by a senior appointee and that only senior appointees can initiate the rulemaking process or approve the agency's regulatory agenda. The order also mandates a review of existing delegations of rulemaking authority and a review of all significant rules issued by agencies in the last 12 years. The order provides definitions for terms such as "agency" and "senior appointee" and states that the Administrator will provide guidance and monitor agency compliance with the order. It includes general provisions stating that it does not impair existing authorities or create new rights or benefits.
