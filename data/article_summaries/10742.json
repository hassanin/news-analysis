In this article, President Obama makes a strong call to both chambers of Congress to approve the framework agreement on tax cuts. He emphasizes that it is important for the American people, as failure to pass the agreement would result in increased taxes for middle-class families and the loss of unemployment insurance for those hit hardest by the recession, jeopardizing the economic recovery. The President argues that increasing taxes on working families could cost over a million jobs and believes that reducing taxes for the middle class is the best way to help the economy and working families. He acknowledges that the agreement is not perfect but highlights the benefits it will bring to the American people, such as new payroll tax cuts and tax credits for education expenses. The President also stresses the importance of unemployment insurance as a safety net for families and its impact on businesses and the overall economy. While recognizing that some members of his own party are unhappy with certain aspects of the agreement, particularly temporary tax cuts for the wealthy, he urges both parties to approve the plan, emphasizing the need to find solutions and not play political games. The President concludes by stating that the opportunity for families to send their children to college and the ability of parents to provide for their families while seeking employment are at stake in this debate, and the Congress's decision will either strengthen or weaken the recovery. He expresses confidence that members of both parties will do the right thing and strengthen the middle class and the economy.
