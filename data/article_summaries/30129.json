On January 22, 2018, the President signed H.R. 195 into law. This law restricts the Government Publishing Office from providing free copies of the Federal Register to Members of Congress and other Government offices. It also includes a short-term continuing resolution that provides fiscal year 2018 appropriations for ongoing projects and activities of the Federal Government until February 8, 2018. Additionally, the law extends the Children's Health Insurance Program and related healthcare programs until fiscal year 2023, suspends certain health-related taxes and fees, and provides direction on the budgetary effects of divisions C and D.
