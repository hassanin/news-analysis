President Obama has announced a new "Call to Arts" initiative as part of his National Call to Service. The initiative, led by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), aims to inspire and mentor young artists across the country. The American Film Institute (AFI) and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) have pledged to work towards a goal of one million mentor hours over the next three years. The announcement was made at the White House Student Film Festival, which showcased 15 student videos on the theme of "The Impact of Giving Back." The initiative aligns with President Obama's vision of providing opportunities for mentoring and supporting future leaders. The partnership between CNCS, AFI, and SAG-AFTRA will connect mentors from the entertainment industry with local organizations to inspire young people in pursuing careers in the arts. The President believes that mentoring plays a crucial role in nurturing the creativity of the next generation, and research shows that mentoring has positive outcomes, such as reducing school absenteeism, drug use, and depressive symptoms, while increasing college aspirations and academic performance. The "Call to Arts" initiative is part of the broader United We Serve initiative, which aims to engage volunteers in community service and promote volunteering and national service programs.
