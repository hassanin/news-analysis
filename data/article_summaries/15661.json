President Barack Obama has issued a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe will continue beyond March 6, 2016. This national emergency was originally declared in 2003 and has been renewed every year since then. The President believes that certain members of the Zimbabwean government and other individuals continue to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes and institutions, leading to a breakdown in the rule of law, politically motivated violence and intimidation, and instability in the southern African region. The President has determined that this threat poses an unusual and extraordinary risk to the foreign policy of the United States, and therefore, it is necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain sanctions to address this threat.
