The Obama Administration has announced two steps to help businesses create jobs and strengthen their competitiveness. The first step is to speed up the transfer of federal research and development from the laboratory to the marketplace. This will be done by streamlining and accelerating the process for private-public research partnerships, small business research and development grants, and university-startup collaborations. It will also give agencies more flexibility to partner with industry and encourage the growth of regional innovation clusters. The second step is the creation of BusinessUSA, a one-stop, central online platform where small businesses and businesses of all sizes can access information about available federal programs without having to navigate the federal bureaucracy. This platform will make it easier for businesses to access services to help them grow and hire. Overall, these steps aim to support innovation, job growth, and strengthen America's competitiveness in the global economy.
