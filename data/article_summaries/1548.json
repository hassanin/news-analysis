President Biden met with Joey and Paula Reed, the parents of Trevor Reed, who is detained in Russia. The President reiterated his commitment to securing Trevor's release, along with other Americans wrongfully held in Russia and elsewhere. This is the President's second interaction with the Reeds, with a previous phone call on March 8. The national security team will stay in contact with the Reeds and other families of Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan previously met with the Reed family in December, expressing the commitment to bringing Trevor home. The administration acknowledges the pain felt by Trevor's loved ones and is dedicated to ending their nightmare.
