President Barack Obama has proclaimed June 2010 as National Oceans Month, urging Americans to protect, conserve, sustain, and enjoy our oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes. This proclamation comes at a time of environmental crisis due to the oil spill in the Gulf Coast region. The oil spill has caused significant damage to the coastline, natural habitats, and the livelihoods of Gulf Coast small businesses and communities. The proclamation emphasizes the need for ongoing efforts to reverse the damage and revitalize affected areas. It also highlights the long-standing strain on our oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes from pollution, overfishing, climate change, and other human activities. The establishment of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force is mentioned, which aims to develop a comprehensive approach to protect, maintain, and restore our oceanic resources. The proclamation concludes by emphasizing the importance of safeguarding our natural resources for future generations.
