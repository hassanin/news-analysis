President Donald J. Trump has authorized an increase in federal funding for Public Assistance projects in Puerto Rico in response to Hurricane Maria. The Federal share for Public Assistance has been increased to 90% of the total eligible costs, except for assistance previously approved at 100%. The authorization is conditional upon the implementation of extra controls on project cost estimation and project management to ensure the efficient rebuilding of Puerto Rico's infrastructure and the cost-effective reduction of future damage. The aim is to ensure sound stewardship of federal tax dollars. For further information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
