The Biden-Harris Administration has launched the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The program aims to provide affordable high-speed internet access to families, particularly students who need internet access for their classes and homework. The ACP offers eligible households up to $30/month (or $75/month on Tribal lands) off internet bills, as well as a one-time $100 discount off a connected device. Additionally, the Administration has worked with internet service providers to offer high-speed plans that are fully covered by the ACP, meaning that millions of working families can access high-speed internet for free. Nearly 40% of U.S. households qualify for the ACP, including families with children. Eligibility is based on income, with households making up to 200% of the federal poverty level being eligible. Families can also qualify regardless of income if they participate in certain federal programs such as the Free and Reduced-Price School Lunch or Breakfast program or if they receive a Pell Grant. Families can check their eligibility and sign up for the program on GetInternet.gov or by calling 877-384-2575. The Biden-Harris Administration is also running a "Back to School" enrollment drive to encourage families to take advantage of the ACP.
