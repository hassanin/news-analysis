Multiple editorial boards, private sector leaders, commentators, and advocacy groups have expressed support for the GOP tax reform plan outlined by President Trump. They believe that the plan has the potential to revitalize the economy, create more jobs, increase worker productivity, and raise wages. The plan includes corporate tax reform, changes to put businesses on a fair footing, and revisions to the personal income tax code to benefit the middle class. Supporters argue that these measures will simplify the tax code, promote business investment, and ultimately benefit American workers and businesses.
