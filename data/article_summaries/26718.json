President Trump has directed the Secretary of Commerce to exclude illegal immigrants from the apportionment base following the 2020 census. He believes that the radical left is trying to erase the concept of American citizenship and conceal the number of illegal aliens in the country. The President argues that giving congressional representation to illegal immigrants would create perverse incentives and undermine the government system. He signed an Executive Order last year to collect accurate census information for responsible decision-making regarding public policy, voting rights, and representation in Congress. This action is in line with his commitment to prioritize the interests of American citizens.
