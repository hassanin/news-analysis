This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by Barack Obama in 2009. The memorandum discusses the importance of community health centers in improving access to healthcare for all Americans. It highlights the role of health centers in serving populations with limited access to healthcare, such as low-income individuals, the uninsured, and those with limited English proficiency. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided funding for health centers to expand their services and make capital improvements. The memorandum emphasizes the benefits of the medical homes approach, which focuses on the patient's relationship with a primary care provider and activities related to quality improvement, access to care, and care management. It directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to implement a Medicare demonstration program to test the medical homes approach in federally qualified health centers.
