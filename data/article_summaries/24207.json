The United States is expressing concern over reports that Russian authorities prevented citizens from peacefully assembling. They are particularly troubled by the detention and mistreatment of protesters, including human rights defender Lyudmila Alekseyeva. The US believes that freedom of speech and assembly are universal rights that all governments should uphold, and they stand with those who advocate for these rights.
