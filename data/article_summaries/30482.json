The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, exceeding expectations and marking the biggest increase in two years. This brings the average monthly job growth to its highest level since 1997. The "goods-producing" industries, including natural resources, mining, construction, and manufacturing, added 100,000 jobs, the largest monthly increase in two decades. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent for the fifth consecutive month, the lowest level seen in 17 years. The number of workers in the U.S. labor force also saw a significant increase. These positive indicators are attributed to President Trump's policies, including tax cuts and regulatory reform, which have created growth and confidence in the U.S. economy. The economy has added nearly 3 million jobs since Trump's election, and jobless claims recently reached a 48-year low. Additionally, the Hispanic and African American unemployment rates reached their lowest levels in history last year. Many businesses have announced pay raises, new job creation, and significant investments as a result of tax reform, and public utilities are passing on their tax reform savings to consumers. Measures of economic confidence, such as the Consumer Confidence Index and small business owners' optimism, are also hitting record levels. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that if Trump's economic policies were fully implemented, the economy would grow at a 3 percent annual pace over the next decade.
