The White House has announced new commitments to the Fair Chance Business Pledge, bringing the total number of pledged employers to 185. The pledge encourages companies to eliminate barriers for individuals with criminal records and create opportunities for a second chance. The new signatories include Walmart, Dropbox, and the University of Pennsylvania. The companies and organizations that have signed the pledge collectively employ over 3 million Americans. The Obama administration has been committed to reforming the criminal justice system and improving opportunities for justice-involved individuals. By signing the pledge, these companies are supporting economic opportunity for all and taking action to reduce barriers to a fair chance. The Federal Interagency Reentry Council also released its strategic plan, highlighting achievements and plans for the future. The Department of Justice released an after-action report on National Reentry Week, which featured over 550 events focused on improving reentry outcomes and raising awareness of successful rehabilitation and reintegration into communities. These announcements build on the administration's efforts to improve reentry outcomes and remove obstacles for formerly incarcerated individuals.
