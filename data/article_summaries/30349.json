On August 17, 2001, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13222, declaring a national emergency with respect to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979. Since the Congress has not renewed the Export Administration Act, the national emergency declared in 2001 must continue beyond August 17, 2018. Therefore, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, the President is continuing the national emergency for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
