This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama in 2015, delegates authority to the Secretary of State to direct the drawdown of up to $35 million in defense services from the Department of Defense. This assistance is intended to support France's efforts in securing Mali, Niger, and Chad from terrorists and violent extremists. The Secretary of State is also authorized to make the necessary determinations required for this drawdown. The memorandum concludes by directing the publication of this document in the Federal Register.
