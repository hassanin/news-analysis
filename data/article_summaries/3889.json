President Biden has declared a major disaster in the State of Mississippi due to severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes that occurred from June 14 to June 19, 2023. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available to individuals in the counties of Jackson and Jasper, which can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Additionally, federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures in various counties and for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. Darryl L. Dragoo of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations, and further designations may be made based on additional damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance online, by phone, or using the FEMA App. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
