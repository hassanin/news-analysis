The President of the United States has declared that the national emergency regarding significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia will continue beyond October 21, 2009. The declaration was initially made on October 21, 1995, and the circumstances leading to it have not been resolved. The actions of these traffickers pose a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States, causing violence, corruption, and harm domestically and internationally. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to maintain economic pressure on these traffickers by blocking their assets and access to the US market and financial system.
