President Zelenskyy of Ukraine will be visiting Washington, D.C. at the invitation of President Biden. The visit is meant to underscore the United States' commitment to Ukraine and its support in the face of Russia's ongoing aggression. President Zelenskyy will have a series of meetings and engagements, including an extended sit-down with President Biden, meetings with key members of the national security team, an opportunity to address the press, and a joint session of Congress. The visit comes on the 300th day since Russia invaded Ukraine and is meant to demonstrate Ukraine's resilience and the strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States. President Biden will announce a significant new package of nearly $2 billion of security assistance for Ukraine, including a Patriot missile battery. The visit is not expected to lead to a diplomatic end to the war, as Russia has shown no intention of ending the conflict. The President's message to the American people is one of solidarity and support for Ukraine, but there are no plans to change the limits on U.S. participation in the war.
