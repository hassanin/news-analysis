The President of the United States released a statement expressing his satisfaction with the Senate's vote to enable the implementation of a comprehensive deal with Iran that aims to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The President sees this vote as a victory for diplomacy, American national security, and global safety. The negotiations lasted for almost two years, during which the US negotiated from a position of strength to achieve their core objectives. The President is pleased that more Senators and citizens have come out in support of the deal as they studied its details. The focus now is on implementing and verifying the deal to ensure Iran cannot pursue nuclear weapons, while also pursuing a foreign policy that promotes a safer world.
