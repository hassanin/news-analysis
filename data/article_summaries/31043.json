President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation recognizing October 2018 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. In the proclamation, he highlights the achievements of Americans with disabilities in the workforce and emphasizes the importance of creating an environment of opportunity for all Americans. The proclamation also mentions the positive indicators in the American economy, including the creation of over 4 million jobs since Trump's election and the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for Americans with disabilities. The President also discusses the establishment of the National Council for the American Worker, which aims to develop a national strategy to provide all Americans, including those with disabilities, more opportunities for employment and skill development. The Department of Labor has also taken action to address disability employment issues, such as providing grants for projects that enable injured or ill workers to remain in or return to the workforce. The Department has also helped states adopt disability employment policies and provided guidance to employers and individuals with disabilities. The President reaffirms his commitment to creating more opportunities for Americans with disabilities and supporting employers who hire them. The proclamation concludes by calling upon government and labor leaders, employers, and the American people to recognize National Disability Employment Awareness Month with appropriate programs and activities.
