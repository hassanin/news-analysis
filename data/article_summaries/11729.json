The "It's On Us" campaign, launched by President Obama and Vice President Biden in 2014, aims to end campus sexual assault by increasing education and awareness. The campaign has released a new Public Service Announcement (PSA) titled "The One Thing," which emphasizes the importance of consent in sexual activity. The campaign has also announced new partners, including The Ad Council, Kering Foundation, Straight But Not Narrow, and Chegg. The Ad Council will distribute the PSA to its network of media outlets. Since the launch of the campaign, over 220,000 people have taken the pledge to end sexual assault on college campuses, and the campaign has generated over 3 billion media impressions. The article also highlights the administration's record in fighting sexual violence, including the creation of the White House Council on Women and Girls and the White House Advisor on Violence Against Women. The administration has also signed executive orders and legislation to address domestic violence and sexual assault, as well as providing funding for various programs to support victims.
