President Obama released a statement expressing his sadness at the retirement of Senator Tom Coburn, with whom he had served in the Senate. Despite their political differences, they had found ways to work together on issues such as transparency in government, reducing wasteful spending, and making the tax system fairer. The President praised Coburn's service to the people of Oklahoma and wished him and his wife the best in the future.
