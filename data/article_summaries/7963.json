The Biden Administration will invest over $4 billion to combat COVID-19 in Indian Country as part of their efforts to ensure the pandemic response reaches all communities. The funding, from the American Rescue Plan, will be used to expand COVID-19 vaccinations, testing, and treatment, increase preventive health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives at higher risk, enhance hospitals' and health clinics' ability to serve their communities, and provide needed funding to the Indian Health Service (IHS), tribal health programs, and urban Indian health programs. The investment includes $600 million for increased vaccinations, $1 billion for infection detection and mitigation, and $2 billion to replace lost revenues for care during the pandemic. The funding will also support urban Indian organizations, health IT and telehealth services, and overall healthcare services in Indian Country. Native communities have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with higher infection rates and hospitalizations.
