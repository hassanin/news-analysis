He highlighted the impact that programs like Food for the Future and the New Alliance on Food Security can have on people's lives. He emphasized the need for new and creative ways to promote development and deliver aid, focusing on making people more productive instead of just giving them food or medicine. He also mentioned the Power Africa program, which follows a similar model. He discussed the potential for increased income for small farmers and the creation of a middle class in African countries, which can lead to local manufacturing and consumer goods and eventually become export markets for the United States. President Obama defended the foreign aid budget, stating that when done right, it can make a huge difference and that other countries have also invested in similar models. He addressed the criticism that the United States has fallen behind China in terms of attention to Africa, stating that it is a good thing that other countries are paying attention to Africa and that it should be seen as an opportunity for all. He emphasized the importance of American companies seeing the potential in Africa and the need for stability and good governance in African countries to attract investment. Regarding his upcoming trip to South Africa, President Obama expressed his admiration for Nelson Mandela and stated that his message will be consistent with the lessons learned from Mandela's life, emphasizing the importance of unity in Africa's rise. He also mentioned that he will gauge the situation regarding Mandela's health and will not be obtrusive during this difficult time for his family.
