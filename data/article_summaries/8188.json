In this article, President Biden discusses his focus on infrastructure during a press conference. He addresses the Republican Party's previous infrastructure plan and their current opposition to his proposed plan. Biden argues that infrastructure includes not just traditional elements like roads and bridges, but also things like clean water, asbestos removal from schools, high-speed rail, and energy-efficient federal buildings. He dismisses concerns about corporations leaving the country due to higher taxes, pointing out that many large corporations have not paid taxes for years. When asked about negotiation with Republicans, Biden states that he will push hard to make necessary changes to compete with other countries investing in infrastructure.
