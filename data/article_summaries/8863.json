Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson is remembered as a visionary, pioneer, and fighter. She experienced the effects of segregation at a young age and dedicated her life to fighting for justice. Johnson achieved many firsts in her career, including becoming the first Black chief psychiatric nurse at the Dallas Veterans Affairs Hospital, the first Black woman elected to public office in Dallas, and the first registered nurse elected to the House of Representatives. Throughout her public service, she fought for equal rights and opportunities for all individuals. As the chair of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Johnson played a vital role in passing the CHIPS and Science Act, which made historic investments in the economy, innovation, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Her tireless work has benefited countless people, and her legacy and leadership will have a lasting impact.
