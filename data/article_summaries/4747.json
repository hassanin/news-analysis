On November 14, 1994, a national emergency was declared by President Biden due to the threat posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and their means of delivery. This declaration was amended twice, on July 28, 1998, and on June 28, 2005, to respond more effectively to the global threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation activities. The national emergency, which was set to expire on November 14, 2021, has now been extended for another year. This decision is based on the continued unusual and extraordinary threat that the proliferation of these weapons and their means of delivery poses to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The extension is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
