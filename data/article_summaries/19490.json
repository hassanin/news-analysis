President Obama has declared a state of emergency in Louisiana due to flooding that occurred between December 28, 2015 and February 1, 2016. This declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate relief efforts and provide assistance to affected areas. FEMA is authorized to mobilize resources and equipment to alleviate the impacts of the emergency, and emergency protective measures will be provided at 75 percent federal funding. Gerard M. Stolar has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
