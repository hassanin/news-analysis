In January 2009, the White House issued a memorandum regarding the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). The EISA mandates that the Secretary of Transportation establish annual fuel economy increases for automobiles, with the goal of achieving a combined fuel economy fleet average of at least 35 miles per gallon by 2020. However, as of the memorandum's release, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) had not yet published a final rule regarding fuel economy standards for model year 2011. The memorandum requests that the NHTSA take all necessary actions to publish the final rule by March 30, 2009, and also urges consideration of legal factors, comments, and scientific considerations when establishing fuel economy standards for future model years. The memorandum also emphasizes the need for consistency with the EISA, the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, and other relevant laws and policies.
