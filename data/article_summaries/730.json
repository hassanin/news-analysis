On June 14 and 15, 2023, the White House hosted a convening of over 80 state legislators from 41 states who are actively involved in advocating for reproductive rights. Vice President Harris also participated in the event, building on her previous meetings with state legislators to discuss efforts to protect access to abortion. Currently, 18 states have implemented extreme and dangerous abortion bans, affecting more than 23 million women of reproductive age. These bans, which often lack exceptions for rape or incest, impose criminal penalties on physicians and interfere with the patient-provider relationship. As a result, women are being denied essential medical care and forced to travel long distances for necessary treatment. The White House convening aimed to bring together legislators from different states to strategize on opposing rollbacks of reproductive rights and supporting access to reproductive health care. Senior White House officials emphasized the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to defending reproductive rights, highlighted actions taken to protect access to reproductive health care, and stressed the importance of state partners in this fight.
