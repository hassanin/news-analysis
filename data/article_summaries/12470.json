This is a press briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney. He discusses various topics including the recent unrest in the Middle East, the sequestration, and the President's daily briefings. Carney states that there was no actionable intelligence indicating that an attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi was planned or imminent. He also explains that the sequestration report is being released later that day and that it was delayed due to the complexity of the issue. Carney defends the President's handling of the Arab Spring and criticizes Governor Romney for his response to the unrest. He emphasizes that the violence in the region is in response to a video that is offensive to Muslims and is not a reflection of U.S. policy. Carney also addresses questions about the security at the Benghazi facility and the President's conversations with foreign leaders. He concludes the briefing by stating that the administration is working to ensure the security of diplomatic facilities and personnel and that the President is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
