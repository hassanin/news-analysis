President Trump marked the 20th anniversary of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act by reaffirming his administration's commitment to eradicating human trafficking. He was joined by Vice President Mike Pence, members of his Cabinet, and representatives and ambassadors involved in combating human trafficking. The President highlighted the magnitude of the problem, with an estimated 25 million people being held captive by human traffickers worldwide. He praised the efforts of his administration in dismantling criminal organizations and prosecuting traffickers, as well as the work of law enforcement agencies such as ICE and the FBI. The President also signed an executive order targeting human trafficking and child exploitation, which includes measures to expand prevention education programs, promote housing opportunities for survivors, and prioritize the removal of child sexual abuse material from the internet. Survivors of human trafficking were present at the event, and one survivor, Bella Hounakey, spoke about her experience and the importance of survivor-centered approaches in combating human trafficking.
