The article discusses the opposition to sanctuary policies and the support for federal immigration laws that protect the American people. Sanctuary jurisdictions, like California, are criticized for hindering federal immigration enforcement efforts by refusing to provide information and restricting cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Many communities in California, including Los Alamitos, San Jacinto, San Juan Capistrano, Escondido, Laguna Niguel, and Lake Elsinore, are against the state's sanctuary policies. County governments, such as Orange County and San Diego County, have also joined the opposition. These sanctuary policies are seen as undermining lawful immigration enforcement efforts and leading to the release of criminal aliens into American communities. President Trump is set to meet with local officials from California to discuss how sanctuary policies undermine law enforcement operations and jeopardize community safety. The article emphasizes that these sanctuary policies must end according to the President.
