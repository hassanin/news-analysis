Today at the 27th U.N. Climate Conference, President Biden will announce new initiatives to strengthen U.S. leadership in tackling the climate crisis and rallying global action. These initiatives demonstrate the United States' commitment to existing commitments and initiatives while also accelerating new efforts. The President aims to lead a clean energy future through market forces, technological innovation, and investments. The initiatives also prioritize supporting vulnerable developing countries in building resilience to climate change. In less than 18 months, President Biden has renewed U.S. leadership in the fight against climate change and is delivering on his Day One promises. The President has taken significant domestic climate action, including passing the Inflation Reduction Act, signing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and ratifying the Kigali Amendment. These efforts align with President Biden's belief that climate security, energy security, food security, and water security are interconnected. The initiatives announced at COP27 include bolstering global climate resilience, accelerating global climate action, catalyzing investment to tackle the climate crisis, and engaging all of society in addressing the climate crisis.
