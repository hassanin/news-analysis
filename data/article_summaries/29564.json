The Wall Street Journal's Editorial Board commends Attorney General Sessions for his efforts to protect taxpayer money by ensuring that settlement funds are given to victims rather than special interest groups. The article criticizes the Obama Administration for its misuse of settlement funds, which it used to bypass Congress's spending power. The Obama Justice Department forced corporate defendants to allocate a portion of their financial penalties to liberal interest groups, even if these groups were not victims or parties to the lawsuits. The memo from Attorney General Sessions instructs Justice's U.S. Attorneys to immediately stop this practice, stating that financial penalties should be used to punish and provide relief to victims, not for political purposes. The article supports the memo and emphasizes that future settlement money should be given directly to victims or to the U.S. Treasury, with limited exceptions.
