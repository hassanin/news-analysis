President Obama has issued a new Executive Order (E.O.) that expands sanctions on individuals contributing to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The order allows for more flexibility in targeting those responsible for actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the DRC, undermine democratic processes or institutions, target women or children through violence or other abuses, use child soldiers, obstruct humanitarian assistance, attack peacekeeping operations, or support armed groups involved in activities that threaten the country's peace or stability. The E.O. also broadens the range of violent conduct for which sanctions can be imposed, now including violence against women and other civilians. The United States remains deeply concerned about the situation in the DRC, which has been marked by armed groups, violence, human rights abuses, and the exploitation of natural resources.
