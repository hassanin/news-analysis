This statement by the President acknowledges the Ukrainian Holodomor, a famine that occurred from 1932 to 1933 due to the deliberate policies of Joseph Stalin's regime. It recognizes the millions of innocent Ukrainians who starved to death and expresses solidarity with Ukrainian-Americans and all Americans in commemorating this tragedy. The statement highlights that Ukraine was once a breadbasket of Europe and could have fed itself if not for the regime's seizure of crops and farms. It pays respect to the victims and acknowledges their strength and courage in overcoming the famine. The President also emphasizes the importance of remembering the Holodomor to reflect on the consequences of extremism and tyranny worldwide, with the hope of preventing such tragedies in the future.
