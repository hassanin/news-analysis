In this letter from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House, the President requests emergency supplemental appropriations of $3.7 billion to address the increase in child and adult migration from Central America in the Rio Grande Valley areas of the Southwest border. The funding would support a sustained border security surge, repatriation and reintegration of migrants, transportation costs, additional immigration judge teams, immigration prosecutors, and immigration litigation attorneys, funding to address the root causes of migration, public diplomacy and international information programs, and the operational costs of responding to the rise in apprehensions of unaccompanied children and adults traveling with children. 

The President also requests $615 million for emergency wildfire suppression activities for the fiscal year 2014 and a new discretionary cap adjustment for wildfire suppression operations starting in fiscal year 2015. This funding would provide for necessary expenses for wildfire suppression and rehabilitation activities without having to transfer funds from wildfire treatment and protection activities. The President proposes a discretionary cap adjustment to allow the Federal Government to respond to severe fires or fire seasons in the same way as other natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes. 

The President urges Congress to act quickly in considering this request and also mentions separate efforts to work with Congress to ensure legal authorities are in place to maximize the impact of their efforts, including providing the Secretary of Homeland Security additional authority in processing the return and removal of unaccompanied minor children from non-contiguous countries and increasing penalties for those who smuggle vulnerable migrants.
