Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the APS Delaney Substation in Tonopah, Arizona, emphasizing the importance of upgrading America's transmission lines to support the transition to cleaner energy sources. She highlighted the need for new high-voltage transmission lines to deliver electricity from wind and solar farms to communities. Harris explained that clean electricity is not only better for the environment but also cheaper, leading to more money in people's pockets. Upgrading transmission lines will also improve energy reliability and create jobs, particularly for IBEW linemen and young people in the clean energy sector.

She praised the consensus that has emerged, leading to the largest investment in fighting the climate crisis in American history.
