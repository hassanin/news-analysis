The Dow Jones industrial average had its biggest gain since early September, rising 256 points or 1.1% to close at a record high of 23,836.71. This surge was fueled by optimism that a tax cut bill is moving closer to reality. The Senate Budget Committee cleared the current version of the Republican-led tax bill in a 12-11 vote, which investors view as the centerpiece of President Trump's economic stimulus initiatives. Lower taxes for businesses and individuals are seen as boosting the economy, corporate earnings, and consumer spending. Small-company stocks were the biggest winners of the day, as they are domestically focused and will benefit the most from lower tax rates.
