The Administration acknowledges the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on disabled individuals, leading to the emergence of new members in the disability community. Over the past year, the Administration has worked with the disability community, taking various actions to address their unique needs. These actions include releasing civil rights guidance to protect disabled individuals during the pandemic, prioritizing services and research for those with Long COVID in the context of disability, establishing a dedicated call line for at-home testing, ensuring access to testing for high-risk individuals, and investing resources from the American Rescue Plan to promote vaccine confidence and access for people with disabilities. Moving forward, the Administration plans to continue ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 testing, masks, and other mitigation strategies for disabled individuals, regardless of their location or the level of virus transmission in their communities. They are committed to implementing and developing policies in collaboration with the disability community, with a focus on equity and accessibility throughout the COVID-19 response and beyond.
