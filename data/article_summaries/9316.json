On July 14, 2020, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the situation in Hong Kong. The President determined that the actions taken by China to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency, initially declared in 2020, is being extended for an additional year. This notice has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
