President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed April 8-14, 2018, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week in the United States. In the proclamation, he emphasizes the need to hold criminals accountable for their actions and support crime victims. The Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) provides assistance to victims through local victim assistance programs and state crime victim compensation programs. However, the proclamation highlights the low percentage of victims who report the offense to police and receive services to assist them. The administration aims to combat crime through initiatives like Project Safe Neighborhoods and the SAFER Act of 2017, which addresses the nationwide rape kit backlog. President Trump calls on all Americans, law enforcement, organizations, and communities to work together to support crime victims and protect their rights.
