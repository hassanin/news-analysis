President Donald Trump recently hosted a bipartisan, bicameral meeting to discuss the infrastructure principles he released earlier this week. Investment in America's infrastructure has historically been a bipartisan issue and is popular among the American public. A Harvard-Harris poll from September 2017 showed that 84 percent of Americans believe the United States needs an investment in infrastructure. Leaders from both the Democratic and Republican parties have expressed support for repairing and modernizing the country's infrastructure. Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Bill Nelson, and Cory Booker have emphasized the need to fix aging infrastructure and create jobs. Republicans like Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, John Thune, and Terry O'Sullivan have highlighted the economic benefits and the need for streamlining the permitting process. The Bipartisan Policy Center has recognized the obstacles that infrastructure projects face, including delays due to sequential permitting and reviews. There is a shared recognition across the political spectrum of the need to reform and invest in the nation's infrastructure.
