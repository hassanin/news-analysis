The White House has announced that Brian McKeon will be the new Deputy Assistant to the President, Executive Secretary, and Chief of Staff of the National Security Staff (NSS). This move will merge the positions of Executive Secretary and Chief of Staff into one, creating a more integrated approach to managing the NSS. Ambassador Brooke Anderson, who previously held the position of Deputy Assistant to the President, Chief of Staff, and Counselor on the National Security Staff, will be leaving government service. President Obama and National Security Advisor Tom Donilon have expressed their appreciation for Anderson's service and have confidence in McKeon's ability to lead the team. McKeon has 25 years of experience in foreign policy and national security issues and has been involved with the NSS since the start of the Obama Administration.
