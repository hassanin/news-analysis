The White House has released state fact sheets highlighting the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act in lowering healthcare costs for Americans. The fact sheets emphasize that Medicare will now be able to negotiate prescription drug prices, out-of-pocket prescription drug costs will be capped at $2,000 annually in Medicare, and individuals will save money on health insurance premiums. The act aims to combat the powerful pharmaceutical lobby and deliver cost savings to American families. It also protects the progress made in expanding access to affordable health insurance coverage, resulting in the lowest uninsured rate in history. President Biden's signing of the act fulfills his promise to lower prescription drug costs, increase affordability of health insurance, and improve the economy for working families.
