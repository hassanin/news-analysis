On World AIDS Day, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. emphasizes the need to continue fighting against HIV/AIDS. While progress has been made in preventing, detecting, and treating HIV, there are still 39 million people living with the virus globally, including over one million in the United States. Discrimination often hinders access to necessary care for those living with HIV. The Biden administration has taken significant steps to address the issue, such as reestablishing the White House Office of National AIDS Policy and launching the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Additionally, the administration ended the ban on gay and bisexual men donating blood and is working to repeal or reform HIV criminalization laws. President Biden has requested $850 million for the Department of Health and Human Services' Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative to reduce new cases, fight stigma, and increase access to preventive medication. Globally, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) aims to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. PEPFAR has made significant progress in reducing transmissions and saving lives. The administration is committed to working with Congress to pass a clean PEPFAR reauthorization bill. President Biden calls for unity and commitment to finish the fight against HIV/AIDS and honors those affected by the disease. He proclaims December 1, 2023, as World AIDS Day and urges support, dignity, and compassion for people living with HIV.
