President Obama welcomes Senator McConnell's decision to support cracking down on wasteful earmark spending. The President has previously called for new limitations on earmarks and increased transparency and accountability. However, he believes that earmarks are only part of the problem and is committed to finding other ways to reduce the deficit for future generations. He looks forward to working with both Democrats and Republicans on this issue.
