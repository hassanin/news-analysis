Last year, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 13800, which aimed to strengthen the cybersecurity of federal networks and critical infrastructure. The order directed departments and agencies to develop reports on cybersecurity risks and opportunities to mitigate those risks. The reports have been completed and are now informing strategies, policies, and actions. The development of the reports required collaboration across the executive branch, as well as input from industry and the public. The information from the reports has also been used to inform the National Security Strategy's significant content on cyber policy. The strategy emphasizes the importance of safeguarding Americans and American businesses in cyberspace. The administration has increased the cyber defense budget and directed department and agency heads to actively manage cybersecurity risks. The policy is to promote an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable internet, and to hold countries accountable for malicious cyber activity originating from their territory. The reports will continue to influence U.S. government policy, and departments and agencies are making information from the reports public to drive a national discussion on managing cybersecurity risk and deterring malicious cyber activity.
