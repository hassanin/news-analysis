The article discusses the issuance of a proclamation by President Donald Trump on January 31, 2020. The proclamation imposes travel restrictions and limitations on nationals from six additional countries - Burma (Myanmar), Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania. These countries were found to have deficiencies in their identity-management and information-sharing practices, posing a risk to the national security and public safety of the United States. The proclamation suspends entry into the United States for nationals of these countries, except for certain categories such as Special Immigrants and Diversity Immigrants. The restrictions will remain in effect until the countries address their identified deficiencies. The article also mentions that the January 2020 proposal recommended visa restrictions on fewer countries than a previous report in September 2019, as some countries have shown progress in improving their practices. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with other relevant officials, will evaluate the need to continue, modify, or terminate the restrictions on an annual basis. The proclamation also revokes a section of a previous proclamation and updates the effective dates.
