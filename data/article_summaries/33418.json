The Office of the First Lady has announced 21 BE BEST Ambassadors from key agencies across the Administration to support Melania Trump's BE BEST campaign. The Ambassadors will help educate children and parents about the issues they face and promote programs and services available to help them. Melania Trump has been collaborating with various departments and agencies to advance the three pillars of BE BEST - the well-being of children, online safety, and combatting opioid abuse. She has also traveled to Africa and met with foreign diplomats to exchange ideas on the challenges children are facing worldwide. The new Ambassadors will serve as a point of contact for promoting BE BEST within their respective agencies. Melania Trump is excited about the partnerships and opportunities to help children reach their fullest potential.
