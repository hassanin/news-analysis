President Obama will be visiting the Gamesa plant in Pennsylvania to hold a town hall meeting with workers. The majority of the audience will be Gamesa workers, and several elected officials are expected to attend. The Obama Administration has been encouraging investment in domestic renewable energy manufacturing and has supported over 7,000 renewable energy projects through the 1603 renewable energy grant program. They have also provided tax credits and proposed a Clean Energy Standard to increase the share of clean energy in America's energy generation. Gamesa, the first overseas wind manufacturer to set up full production facilities in the US, currently employs about 900 workers in North America, with 800 in Pennsylvania. They have made significant investments in Pennsylvania and have purchased over $900 million of US-sourced content and services. Gamesa has also opened an Offshore Wind Technology Center in Virginia in partnership with Huntington Ingalls Industries to design their first generation of offshore wind turbine. The company has installed over 2,400 megawatts at 24 wind farms in 11 states and has another 900 megawatts under construction, expected to be operational by the end of 2011.
