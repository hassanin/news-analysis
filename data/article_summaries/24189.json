This article is a proclamation by President Barack Obama declaring the week of January 10-16, 2010 as the National Influenza Vaccination Week. The proclamation highlights the global spread of the H1N1 influenza virus since it was first identified in the United States in April of the previous year. It emphasizes that while most people recover without complications, a higher proportion of children and young adults have experienced serious complications, including hospitalization and death. The proclamation states that vaccination is the best way to protect against the flu and encourages pregnant mothers, children, young adults, and those with chronic illnesses under the age of 65 to get vaccinated as soon as possible. It also urges those who are not at high risk to get vaccinated in order to protect more vulnerable members of their families and communities. The article concludes with a call to action, asking people to visit flu.gov to find vaccination locations and stay informed. President Obama signs the proclamation, urging all Americans to observe the week by getting vaccinated and encouraging their family, friends, and colleagues to do the same.
