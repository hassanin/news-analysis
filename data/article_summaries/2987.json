One year ago, President Biden signed the PACT Act, which is a bipartisan legislation aimed at expanding benefits and services for veterans exposed to toxins. The act is named after Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, a combat medic who died from a rare form of lung cancer. The legislation aims to provide timely benefits and services to veterans affected by toxic exposures while serving in the military. President Biden believes that the country has a responsibility to properly prepare and care for the troops and their families. Military service can lead to increased health risks, and some illnesses may take years to manifest. This can make it challenging for veterans to establish a direct connection between their service and disabilities resulting from toxic exposures. The PACT Act eliminates these barriers and ensures that veterans receive the healthcare and services they deserve. President Biden has made supporting veterans a core element of his agenda, and he joins veterans and their families to discuss the impact of the PACT Act at the George E. Wahlen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Biden-Harris administration will also release new national and state-by-state data on PACT Act claims, which have been processed at record rates by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The administration has worked to support veterans in every state and territory by addressing military toxic exposures and providing necessary care and services. Veterans can visit www.va.gov/PACT or their local VA hospital to check their eligibility for PACT Act benefits and services.
