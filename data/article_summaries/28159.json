On May 9, 2018, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Following the announcement, several members of Congress, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, expressed their support for the decision, stating that the deal was flawed and did not adequately address Iran's hostile actions and nuclear ambitions. Other Republican lawmakers, such as Sen. Tom Cotton and Sen. Marco Rubio, criticized the deal for providing sanctions relief to Iran while allowing it to continue supporting terrorism and developing long-range missiles. Various foreign officials, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the United Arab Emirates Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar bin Mohammed Gargash, also praised the decision, while advocacy organizations like The Heritage Foundation and the Republican Jewish Coalition supported the move as well. Editorial boards from publications such as The Wall Street Journal and the Washington Examiner also expressed their approval of President Trump's decision, with some calling the Iran deal flawed and a threat to national security.
