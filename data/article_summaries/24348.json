The White House Press Secretary issued a statement on August 12, 2009, regarding two bills signed into law by the President. The first bill, H.R. 838, known as the "Miami Dade College Land Conveyance Act," transfers a piece of land in Miami Dade County, Florida, from the Bureau of Prisons to Miami Dade College. The land will be used for the construction of a new educational building and parking area. The second bill, S. 1107, titled the "Judicial Survivors Protection Act of 2009," establishes a 6-month special open enrollment period for judicial officials to enroll in the Judicial Survivors' Annuities System.
