President Trump has announced that $90.9 million in grants will be awarded to 731 local drug prevention coalitions as part of the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Drug-Free Communities Support Program. This marks the largest number of grantees in a single year since the program's inception 20 years ago. The grants will be used to prevent youth substance use, including prescription drugs, marijuana, tobacco, and alcohol. The program aims to mobilize communities to address the issue of youth substance abuse and strengthen partnerships between various stakeholders, such as parent groups, schools, healthcare professionals, and law enforcement. The focus on prescription drug abuse prevention is highlighted as one of the core measures of effectiveness for the local coalitions, with innovative initiatives being led nationwide. The program's evaluation report for 2017 found that a high percentage of youth in DFC communities reported not misusing prescription drugs in the past 30 days.
