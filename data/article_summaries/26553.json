The President of the United States, Donald Trump, has notified Congress of his intention to terminate the designation of Cameroon as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). This decision is based on the determination that the Government of Cameroon is currently engaging in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, which goes against the eligibility requirements of the AGOA. The violations include extrajudicial killings, arbitrary and unlawful detention, and torture. The termination of Cameroon's designation will take effect on January 1, 2020, but the government's engagement in human rights violations will continue to be assessed in accordance with AGOA eligibility requirements.
