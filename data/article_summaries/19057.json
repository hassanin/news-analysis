President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Hawaii and authorized federal aid to assist in the recovery efforts following severe storms, flooding, and landslides that occurred from March 3-11, 2012. The federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in Kauai County. Additionally, federal funding will be provided for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Mark H. Armstrong has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made if requested by the state and deemed necessary.
