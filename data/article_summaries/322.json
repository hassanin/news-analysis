President Biden has made it a priority to make the United States a global leader in manufacturing. Boeing recently completed two significant deals with Saudi Arabia, worth nearly $37 billion. These deals involve manufacturing 121 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft with General Electric's advanced GEnex engines. These transactions, along with a previous deal with Air India, will support over one million American jobs in the aerospace supply chain across 44 states. The deals with Saudi Arabia alone will create more than 140,000 American jobs, many of which do not require a four-year college degree. This partnership between Boeing, General Electric, and Saudi Arabia marks another milestone in the longstanding cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the American industry. The administration is committed to working with Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern partners to promote a more prosperous and secure region, benefiting the American people.
