Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at an event celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave Act. She highlighted the importance of providing working people, especially working mothers, with the support they need. Harris shared a personal story about caring for her mother during her cancer treatment and emphasized that every worker should be able to take time off to care for themselves or their loved ones. She noted that when women receive the leave they need, they are more likely to stay in the workforce, leading to a stronger economy. Harris called for building on the Family and Medical Leave Act to ensure that every worker has access to paid family and medical leave. She then introduced former President Bill Clinton, who signed the act into law and was praised for his commitment to workers and families.
