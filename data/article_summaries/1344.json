Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger announced that the United States will provide $25 million in cybersecurity support to the Government of Costa Rica. This support aims to help Costa Rica establish a national security operations center to detect and respond to cyber attacks, as well as implement cybersecurity protections for its government systems. The U.S. previously provided rapid support to Costa Rica following ransomware attacks in 2022 that disrupted government services. During her visit to Costa Rica, Neuberger met with senior government officials to emphasize the Biden-Harris Administration's collaboration with global partners in strengthening cyber infrastructure and ensuring citizens' access to critical services. This announcement aligns with the U.S.'s commitment to supporting democracies' access to secure and reliable digital technology, as showcased during the Summit for Democracy.
