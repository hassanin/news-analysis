Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko about various topics including the situation in the Donbas, Ukrainian political and economic reforms, and implementation of the Minsk agreements. Biden congratulated Poroshenko on reaching an agreement with Ukraine's commercial creditors on debt restructuring and welcomed the news of an agreement among pro-reform political forces to run a common slate of candidates in Ukraine's local elections. The Vice President expressed strong support for constitutional amendments proposed by Poroshenko and Ukraine's Constitutional Commission that would allow for decentralization of power while preserving Ukraine's unitary state structure. The leaders also discussed the escalation of attacks by combined Russian-separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, including attacks on OSCE monitors. Biden criticized separatist leaders' statements indicating their intention to take additional territory and hold local elections outside of the Ukrainian legal framework, which goes against the Minsk agreements.
