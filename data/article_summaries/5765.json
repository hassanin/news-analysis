The US government has notified the Speaker of the House and the President of its intention to terminate Burkina Faso's designation as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). This decision is based on the determination that Burkina Faso has not established or made sufficient progress towards establishing the protection of the rule of law and political pluralism, as required by the AGOA. The termination will take effect on January 1, 2023, but the government will continue to assess Burkina Faso's progress in meeting the eligibility requirements. The letter was signed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
