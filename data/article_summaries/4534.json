The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework aims to address the persistent poverty in rural and Tribal communities by investing in various areas. It includes providing high-speed internet to every home, ensuring clean drinking water, fixing rural roads and bridges, building resilience to climate change and extreme weather events, and cleaning up pollution in fossil fuel communities. The framework also focuses on connecting rural communities through rail, building and upgrading airports, ports, and waterways, and investing in electric transmission infrastructure. The goal is to create jobs, improve infrastructure, and support economic growth in rural America.
