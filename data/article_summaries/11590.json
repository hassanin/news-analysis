President Barack Obama issued a proclamation declaring November 22, 2013, as a Day of Remembrance for President John F. Kennedy. The proclamation honors Kennedy's legacy and calls upon all Americans to honor his life and legacy through appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. The proclamation also encourages the flag to be flown at half-staff and for Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day. Kennedy's leadership during the Cuban Missile Crisis and his efforts to advance civil rights and women's rights are highlighted as part of his enduring imprint on American history. The proclamation recognizes Kennedy's vision and the generations he inspired to serve as ambassadors for peace, reach new heights in science and engineering, and pursue innovation.
