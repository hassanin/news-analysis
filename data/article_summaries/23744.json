The White House has issued a notice to continue the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations. The national emergency was initially declared in 2011 due to the threat these organizations pose to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. These organizations have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous, with involvement in foreign governments and the international financial system. They undermine democratic institutions, degrade the rule of law, and disrupt economic markets. The continuation of the national emergency is necessary to address this ongoing threat.
