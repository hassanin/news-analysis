President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New Hampshire and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms, flooding, and landslides occurred from June 26 to July 3, 2013. The declaration allows for federal funding to supplement state and local recovery efforts, including emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. James N. Russo has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and more designations may be made if further damage assessments warrant it.
