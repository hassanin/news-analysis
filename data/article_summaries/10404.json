This article is a presidential memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on August 10, 2012. The memorandum discusses the continuation of U.S. drug interdiction assistance to the Government of Colombia. The President certifies that the interdiction of aircraft suspected of being involved in illicit drug trafficking in Colombia's airspace is necessary due to the significant threat posed by drug trafficking to the country's national security. The memorandum also states that Colombia has appropriate procedures in place to prevent the loss of innocent lives during these interdictions, including effective measures to identify and warn aircraft before using force. The Secretary of State is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register and inform the Congress of this decision.
