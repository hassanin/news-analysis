The article is a Presidential Determination by Barack Obama identifying major drug transit and major illicit drug producing countries for fiscal year 2015. The countries listed include Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. The list does not reflect the government's counternarcotics efforts or cooperation with the United States, but rather the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced. Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela are designated as countries that have failed to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements. The article also discusses the international framework for narcotics and crime control, the challenges of opium poppy production and heroin, cocaine production and use, new psychoactive substances, and drug awareness and demand reduction. The United States' foreign assistance programs aim to combat drug production and support law enforcement, but also take a holistic approach to enhance overall citizen security and promote respect for the rule of law and human rights.
