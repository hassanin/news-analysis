On March 6, 2003, the President declared a national emergency and blocked the property of certain individuals in Zimbabwe who were undermining the country's democratic processes. This was done to address the threat posed to the foreign policy of the United States. Additional steps were taken in 2005 and 2008 to expand the scope of the national emergency and block the property of more individuals involved in undermining democratic processes. The actions and policies of these individuals continue to pose a threat to US foreign policy, so the national emergency declared in 2003 is being extended for another year. This notice was published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress on March 1, 2023.
