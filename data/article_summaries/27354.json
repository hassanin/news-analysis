The executive order issued on December 21, 2020, focuses on the importance of beautiful public architecture in the United States. It recognizes the historical significance of classical architecture and its ability to inspire civic pride and virtue. The order criticizes the shift towards modernist designs in the 1950s, which often resulted in unpopular and unappealing federal buildings. The order emphasizes the need for federal buildings to uplift and beautify public spaces, respect regional architectural heritage, and command respect from the general public. It encourages the use of classical and traditional architecture, while also considering other styles where appropriate. The order establishes the President's Council on Improving Federal Civic Architecture, which will be responsible for recommending updates to policies and procedures to incorporate the order's principles. The order also requires the Administrator of General Services to adhere to the policies set forth in the order and notify the President if a design deviates from the preferred architecture.
