The White House Press Secretary released a statement expressing disappointment in the Senate's decision to protect tax breaks for the oil and gas industry. The statement argues that these tax breaks are unnecessary and unwarranted, especially considering the record profits made by oil companies. The administration believes that federal funds could be better spent on investments that would benefit American consumers and help mitigate high gas prices. The statement concludes by stating that today's vote, which had support from over half of the Senate, is a crucial step towards repealing these subsidies, and the administration will continue to pursue this reform.
