In a recent briefing, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Seema Verma and Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor Kellyanne Conway announced a new deal between insulin manufacturers and health plans to benefit older Americans who take insulin to treat diabetes. The deal aims to reduce the out-of-pocket costs of insulin for seniors, with a maximum co-pay of $35 for a month's supply of all types of insulin. This represents a 66% reduction in out-of-pocket costs. The initiative is part of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce healthcare costs and improve care for vulnerable populations, including seniors. The announcement was made in the Rose Garden and included the participation of insulin manufacturers, health insurers, and patient advocacy groups. The timing of the announcement aligns with the upcoming open enrollment period for Medicare plans. The administration also highlighted its efforts to address healthcare costs and improve care for seniors during the COVID-19 pandemic, including expanding telehealth coverage and prioritizing infectious disease standards at nursing homes.
