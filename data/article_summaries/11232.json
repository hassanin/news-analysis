President Obama has issued a statement expressing his support for the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, introduced by Chairman Hatch, Senator Wyden, and Chairman Ryan. The President emphasizes that his top priority in any trade negotiation is to expand opportunities for hardworking Americans. He acknowledges that past trade deals have not always lived up to their promises and states that he will only sign an agreement that helps ordinary Americans get ahead. Additionally, he stresses the importance of the United States writing the rules for the global economy, rather than leaving it to countries like China. The President believes that the bill put forward would avoid past mistakes, seize future opportunities, and uphold American values. He highlights that the legislation would level the playing field, provide fair opportunities for workers, and include enforceable protections for workers' rights, the environment, and a free and open internet. The President points out that American exports support over 11 million jobs and that companies that export tend to pay higher wages. He looks forward to working with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to pass the bill and create more American jobs with better wages and benefits. The President also welcomes the introduction of Trade Adjustment Assistance legislation to strengthen the current program and protect American workers.
