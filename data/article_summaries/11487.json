On July 20, 2012, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation to honor the victims of the tragic shooting in Aurora, Colorado. The proclamation orders that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff at the White House, public buildings and grounds, military posts and naval stations, and naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset on July 25, 2012. The flag is also to be flown at half-staff for the same duration at all United States embassies, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
