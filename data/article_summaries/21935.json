President Obama has signed an Executive Order to promote industrial energy efficiency in order to strengthen American manufacturing and create jobs. These efforts, including the use of combined heat and power systems, can save manufacturers up to $100 billion in energy costs over the next decade. The goal is to reduce energy consumption, harmful emissions, and improve the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing. The Executive Order directs various departments and agencies to coordinate actions at the federal level, provide assistance to states, and foster a national dialogue through regional workshops. The Order also sets a new national goal of achieving 40 gigawatts of new combined heat and power capacity by 2020, which would result in significant energy savings, capital investment, job creation, and emission reductions.
