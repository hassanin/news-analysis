The article is a letter from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House regarding the continuation of a national emergency declaration concerning significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia. The letter states that the emergency, which was declared on October 21, 1995, is to continue beyond October 21, 2012. The President highlights that the circumstances that led to the declaration have not been resolved and that these traffickers pose a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. To maintain pressure on these traffickers, the President has determined that it is necessary to block their property and interests in the United States and deny them access to the U.S. market and financial system.
