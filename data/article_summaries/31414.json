President Donald J. Trump has authorized an increase in federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures in the State of California in response to the wildfires that began on August 14, 2020. Under the major disaster declaration issued on August 22, 2020, federal funding was initially set at 75% of eligible costs. However, President Trump has now authorized a 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures for a continuous period of 30 days, as established by the State of California.
