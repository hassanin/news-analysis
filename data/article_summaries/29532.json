The US Senate has confirmed President Trump's 150th judicial nominee, fulfilling his campaign promise to reshape the federal bench with conservative judges. Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham, described this as a "historic milestone." Trump has appointed a total of 105 judges to the lower federal courts, as well as 43 circuit court nominees and two Supreme Court justices. This pace of appointments far exceeds that of former President Obama.
