The Department of Justice is taking action to reduce the number of guns sold without background checks and keep guns out of the hands of criminals. In March, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing the Attorney General to move closer to universal background checks. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was also passed to address the issue of individuals refusing to obtain a license and skirting the background check requirement. The Justice Department has now announced a proposed rule to clarify the new definition in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The rule would specify that individuals who are not selling guns to make money, such as selling to family members or as a hobby, do not need a license. However, if someone is offering a firearm for sale to make money and telling customers they can purchase additional firearms, they would likely need a license and be required to run background checks. The proposed rule also clarifies that there is no "gun show loophole" or "internet loophole" in federal law. Dealers who engage in the business of selling guns are required to obtain a license and run background checks, regardless of where they conduct their business. The rule is now open for public comment, and Congress is urged to act on universal background checks and other measures to address gun violence.
