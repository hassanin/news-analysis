President Trump announced a new initiative called the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program to support farmers, ranchers, and growers in the United States. The program will provide $19 billion to assist agricultural producers and maintain the food supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this program, $16 billion will be allocated for direct payments to farmers and ranchers. The payments will compensate for losses related to the global pandemic caused by China. The program also includes the Farmers to Families Food Box program, which will purchase $3 billion worth of food from American farmers and distribute it to food banks and charities. The President emphasized the importance of the agricultural sector and expressed gratitude to farmers for their efforts in feeding the nation.
