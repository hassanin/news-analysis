National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy and Special Climate Envoy John Kerry held a teleconference to discuss President Biden's participation in the World Leader Summit in Glasgow. McCarthy emphasized the importance of taking action on climate change and highlighted the administration's commitment to reducing emissions and achieving a net-zero economy. She also mentioned the release of the United States' long-term strategy report, which outlines pathways to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Kerry discussed the goals of the summit, including raising global ambition, committing to the 1.5-degree target, and addressing finance and adaptation. He also addressed concerns about the administration's request to boost energy production, explaining that it is a temporary measure to facilitate the transition to clean energy. Both McCarthy and Kerry addressed questions about the G20's commitment to coal and the Supreme Court challenge to the EPA's regulation of carbon emissions. McCarthy expressed confidence in the EPA's authority to regulate emissions, while Kerry defended the G20's commitment to ending unabated coal power generation and finance by the end of 2021. Kerry also mentioned the administration's acknowledgment of the need to address loss and damage caused by climate change. The teleconference ended with a discussion about President Biden's schedule and engagements during the summit, with details to be provided at a later time.
