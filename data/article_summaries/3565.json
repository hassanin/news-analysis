White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki held a briefing where she discussed several topics. Psaki highlighted the benefits of the Build Back Better Agenda, which recently passed the House, including cost reductions for families in areas such as pre-K, childcare, health insurance premiums, and housing. She also mentioned that the plan reduces the deficit by $112 billion over 10 years and addressed concerns about inflation, stating that leading economists believe the plan will not contribute to higher prices. Psaki provided an update on COVID-19, mentioning the FDA's authorization of boosters for all adults and the administration's efforts to protect children through vaccinations. She also mentioned the President's infrastructure implementation team and their first meeting, as well as updates on supply chain issues and the President's schedule for Thanksgiving week. Psaki addressed questions about the game plan for getting the Build Back Better plan through the Senate, the nomination of two new members to the Postal Service Board of Governors, and the President's physical. She also discussed oil-related issues, vaccine mandates, the Kyle Rittenhouse trial verdict, and concerns raised by Catholic bishops. Psaki concluded the briefing by stating that the President is committed to reducing hunger and ensuring the safety and well-being of military families.
