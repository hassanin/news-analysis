The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has proposed a modernization plan for the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which turned 50 years old in 2020. NEPA requires Federal agencies to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of major projects such as infrastructure development. However, complying with the regulatory requirements has become complex and time-consuming, leading to delays in important infrastructure projects. The proposed modernization aims to reduce the average time to complete an environmental impact statement (EIS) by increasing interagency coordination and implementing President Trump's One Federal Decision policy. The modernization is expected to improve the American economy, lives, and public safety by reducing excessive permitting delays and improving infrastructure.
