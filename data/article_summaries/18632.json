President Obama has authorized a series of actions in response to Russian cyber operations and harassment of US officials during the 2016 election. The President has amended Executive Order 13964 to allow for sanctions on individuals and entities that tamper with election processes. As a result, nine entities and individuals, including two Russian intelligence services (GRU and FSB) and three companies supporting the GRU's cyber operations, have been sanctioned. Additionally, the Department of Treasury has designated two Russian individuals, Evgeniy Bogachev and Aleksey Belan, for cyber-enabled misappropriation of funds and personal information. In response to increased harassment of US diplomatic personnel in Russia, the President has declared 35 Russian government officials as "persona non grata" and expelled them from the US. Furthermore, Russian access to two government-owned compounds in Maryland and New York will be denied. The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are releasing a Joint Analysis Report (JAR) containing technical information on Russian cyber activity, aiming to help network defenders identify and disrupt malicious cyber activities. The report includes information on Russian malware, infrastructure, and tactics. The government encourages security companies and private sector owners to use this information to block malicious cyber activity. The Obama administration is committed to using all available tools and authorities to counter cyber threats and protect national security.
