The statement by Christina Romer, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, discusses the advance estimate of GDP for the fourth quarter of 2009. The report shows that the total output of the U.S. economy increased strongly, with real GDP growing at an annual rate of 5.7 percent. This is a significant improvement compared to the first quarter of 2009 when GDP fell at an annual rate of 6.4 percent. However, despite positive GDP growth, the focus should remain on getting Americans back to work. The statement emphasizes the need for policy actions to spur private sector job creation. The President is announcing a plan for a small business jobs and wages tax cut. The rapid growth in real GDP was partly due to a rise in inventory investment, which is a normal part of healthy recoveries. Other components of GDP, such as business investment and consumer spending, also rose. The statement cautions against reading too much into a single report and acknowledges that there may be challenges ahead. Nonetheless, the report is seen as encouraging news.
