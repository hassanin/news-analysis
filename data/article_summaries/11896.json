On June 8, 2012, the President signed three bills into law. The first one, H.R. 2947, releases deed restrictions on a parcel of land in Minnesota that was given to the state for an airport in 1950. The second bill, H.R. 3992, designates Israel as a foreign state whose citizens can enter the United States as nonimmigrants if they have invested a significant amount of capital in an enterprise and are involved in its management. Lastly, H.R. 4097, known as the "John F. Kennedy Center Reauthorization Act of 2012," authorizes appropriations for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for fiscal years 2013-2014 and allows for the construction of an addition to the south end of the Kennedy Center building using funds that are not appropriated.
