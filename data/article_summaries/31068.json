The article criticizes Voice of America (VOA), a global news network funded by American taxpayers, for often speaking for America's adversaries rather than its citizens. It accuses VOA of amplifying Beijing's propaganda during the Coronavirus pandemic, including calling China's Wuhan lockdown a successful "model" and comparing China's Coronavirus death toll to America's using Communist government statistics. The article also mentions VOA's promotion of Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif's Twitter feed and Russian anti-U.S. propaganda videos. It argues that VOA is promoting propaganda instead of fulfilling its mission to represent America and promote freedom and democracy.
