The President called Senator Patty Murray and Representative Jeb Hensarling to discuss the status of the Joint Select Committee's discussions on deficit reduction. The President urged them to encourage the Committee to reach a deal and reminded them of his detailed deficit reduction plan. He emphasized that any approach must be balanced and will require tough choices on both sides, including looking at revenues and entitlements. The President also made it clear that he will not accept any measure that tries to turn off part of the sequester, as it was agreed upon by both parties as an enforcement mechanism. He urged the leaders to come together and make the necessary tough choices to live within our means.
