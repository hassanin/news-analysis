In this article, it is mentioned that President Barack Obama sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives regarding amendments to the fiscal year 2010 proposals included in the fiscal year 2011 budget for the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice. The letter requests that Congress consider the attached amendments, which aim to enhance border security, federal border protection, law enforcement operations, and anti-narcotics activities. The requested funds would be partially offset by cancelling $100 million from a lower-priority program within the Department of Homeland Security, resulting in a net increase of $500 million to the proposed FY 2010 budget. The President emphasizes the urgent and essential nature of these needs and requests that the proposals be considered as emergency requirements. The details of this request are outlined in the attached letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
