Vice President Joe Biden visited Chile to attend the inauguration of President-Elect Michelle Bachelet. The visit highlighted the strong ties between the United States and Chile and emphasized cooperation in various areas. The U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement has been beneficial for both countries, with bilateral trade in goods reaching $28 billion in 2013. The United States and Chile are also part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, which aim to create a comprehensive trade agreement covering 40% of global GDP. The United States looks forward to working closely with Chile on multilateral issues as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and UN Human Rights Council. Chile was recently designated as the 38th country to participate in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, which will strengthen people-to-people ties and facilitate trade and travel. In terms of education exchange, the "100,000 Strong in the Americas" initiative aims to increase student exchange between the United States and Chile, with several partnerships already established between universities of both countries.
