On August 24, 2016, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation establishing the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in north central Maine. The monument covers approximately 87,500 acres and is located within the larger landscape of the North Woods. The area contains mountains, woods, and waters, including the East Branch of the Penobscot River and its tributaries. The region has a rich natural and cultural history, attracting Native Americans, lumberjacks, artists, and scientists throughout the years. The area is also significant from a scientific and historic perspective, with Native American artifacts and geological formations dating back millions of years. The establishment of the monument aims to preserve and protect these natural and historic objects. The monument will be managed by the National Park Service, and the Secretary of the Interior will prepare a management plan within three years. Hunting will be allowed in certain areas, and efforts will be made to protect Indian sacred sites and cultural sites within the monument.
