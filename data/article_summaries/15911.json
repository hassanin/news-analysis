This article is a transcript of a press briefing held by the White House Office of the Press Secretary on March 3, 2011. The briefing was led by Gene B. Sperling, the Director of the National Economic Council, and Dan Pfeiffer, the Communications Director. The purpose of the briefing was to discuss the budget discussions between the President and Vice President and the House and Senate leadership. The President believes that spending needs to be cut, but it should not sacrifice investments in education, innovation, and research. The administration has already proposed cuts and is willing to compromise further. The briefing also addresses the discrepancy in the numbers between the administration and the Republicans in terms of spending cuts. The administration believes that they have met the Republicans halfway and are willing to continue negotiating. The briefing ends with a discussion on the potential impact of the cuts on jobs and the economy.
