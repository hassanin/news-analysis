President Obama has announced the formation of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), a group of leading scientists and engineers who will advise the President and Vice President on matters related to science, technology, and innovation. The PCAST will be co-chaired by John Holdren, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, along with Eric Lander and Harold Varmus. The council consists of experts from various scientific disciplines and will provide recommendations on national strategies to promote scientific innovation. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was established by Congress in 1976 and is responsible for providing scientific and technological analysis to the President and other executive agencies. The OSTP works to develop and implement science and technology policies, promote partnerships between the government and the private sector, and evaluate the effectiveness of federal science and technology efforts.
