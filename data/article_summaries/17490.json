The White House has announced actions to drive growth in the solar energy industry and train workers for clean-energy jobs. The Department of Energy (DOE) is setting a goal to train 75,000 people to enter the solar workforce by 2020, some of whom will be veterans. The DOE, in partnership with the Department of Defense (DOD), is launching a Solar Ready Vets program at 10 military bases across the country. The program will train transitioning military service personnel to enter the solar workforce. The Department of Veterans Affairs is also working to achieve approval for GI Bill funding for solar workforce training. The Department of Labor will work with the DOD to ensure that transitioning service members are aware of solar workforce training programs available to them. The U.S. has made significant progress in deploying solar energy, with solar electricity generation increasing 20 fold since President Obama took office. Last year, the U.S. installed as much solar every three weeks as it did in all of 2008. The Department of Defense is making progress toward its target of deploying 3 gigawatts of renewable energy on its installations by 2025. Federal agencies have also cut their emissions by 17 percent since President Obama took office and tripled the share of electricity coming from renewable sources. The Department of the Interior has permitted 52 utility-scale renewable energy projects, including 29 solar projects, on public lands. The White House has also launched the Climate Action Champion competition to recognize local climate leaders and provide federal support to help those communities further raise their ambitions.
