Today, the United States mourns the loss of 900,000 lives to COVID-19. These individuals were cherished family members and friends, and their absence is deeply felt. The pandemic has taken a toll on the emotional, physical, and psychological well-being of the nation. However, there is hope in the form of vaccines and boosters, which have been proven to be highly effective in saving lives. 250 million Americans have already received at least one dose of the vaccine, leading to the preservation of over a million lives. To further prevent the loss of more lives and alleviate the pain of countless families, it is crucial for everyone to get vaccinated, including children, and to receive booster shots if eligible. Vaccination is a free, easy, and effective way to protect oneself and loved ones from the virus.
