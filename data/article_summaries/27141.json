Karen Pence, the Second Lady, expressed gratitude to the members of the Congressional Club for visiting Tracy's Kids Art Therapy Program at Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. During the visit, they engaged in various activities, including creating gold medal awards with children and parents. The highlight of the visit was the presence of Noah Grove, a former Tracy's Kids patient and gold medal Paralympic hockey star. The kids and parents were thrilled to meet Noah and hold his gold medal. Following this, a panel discussion took place with parents, patients, and Tracy, the art therapist who co-founded Tracy's Kids with Matt Gerson two decades ago. The panel shared incredible stories that highlighted the power of art therapy. These stories included a "worry box" for a young boy, an "escape plan" created by two patients to focus on life after cancer treatment, a young patient expressing herself through pictures, and numerous stories of children wanting to return to the hospital to participate in art therapy. Karen Pence expressed her gratitude to Tracy and all the Tracy's Kids art therapists for their valuable work. Tracy's Kids operates in seven facilities across five states, and the congressional spouses showed interest in learning more about the power of art therapy.
