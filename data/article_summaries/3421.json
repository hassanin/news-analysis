The Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to support the victims and communities affected by the Maui wildfires. President Biden has authorized three Fire Management Assistance Grants and signed a Major Disaster Declaration for the state. Over 1,000 federal personnel, including nearly 450 search and rescue team members, are on the ground in Maui to aid in the response efforts. President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will visit Maui to meet with survivors, first responders, and state and local officials. The federal government, including various departments and agencies, is working closely with state and local partners to assess ongoing needs and provide resources and personnel. Individuals impacted by the disaster are encouraged to register for federal assistance online or by phone, and a Disaster Recovery Center has been opened for in-person assistance. The federal response efforts will continue as long as necessary to support the recovery of Maui.
