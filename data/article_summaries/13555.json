Vice President Biden has directed agency heads to cut waste in their departments and reduce excessive spending. Reports of excessive spending on catering for government conferences have prompted a thorough review of how taxpayer dollars are being spent on conferences. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director has instructed agency heads to have all conference-related activities and expenses approved by top officials. In December, all agency heads will reconvene to discuss their efforts to cut waste in conference-related expenses and other areas of operation. The goal is to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used efficiently to provide necessary services and strengthen the economy.
