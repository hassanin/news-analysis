This article is a fact sheet about the Ukraine-related sanctions issued by President Obama in 2014. The Executive Order finds that the actions and policies of the Russian government, including the deployment of Russian military forces in Crimea, undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine. The new authority expands upon a previous Executive Order by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to impose sanctions on named officials of the Russian government, individuals or entities in the Russian arms industry, and individuals or entities that support senior Russian government officials. The article lists the seven Russian government officials being designated for sanctions, as well as four other individuals who have been sanctioned for their actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine. The article states that these actions send a strong message to Russia about the consequences of violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and that further political and economic costs may be imposed if Russia does not abide by its international obligations.
