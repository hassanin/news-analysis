President Obama will be visiting American Cord & Webbing Co. Inc, a small business in Rhode Island, to highlight their success story and discuss how small businesses can benefit from the Small Business Jobs Act. American Cord & Webbing was able to bring back all their laid-off employees and has plans to hire more. They were also approved for an SBA loan to expand their facility. The Small Business Jobs Act provides fee waivers and loan provisions that help small businesses like American Cord & Webbing save money. The act also includes eight new small business tax cuts, such as immediate write-offs for new capital and equipment investments and deductions for health insurance costs. Small businesses can also benefit from tax cuts on cell phone use, capital gains taxes, start-up expenses, and more. The HIRE Act provides tax exemptions and credits for small businesses that hire unemployed workers. Small businesses are now eligible for larger SBA loans, and new Treasury programs are being set up to provide credit and support for small businesses seeking to expand.
