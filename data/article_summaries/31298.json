President Trump delivered remarks at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where he signed the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This act provides $738 billion in defense funding, making it the largest-ever investment in the US military. The NDAA also authorizes the creation of the Space Force, the newest branch of the military. Trump emphasized the importance of American superiority in space and the need to deter aggression in this domain. The act also includes provisions for pay raises for military personnel, improvements in education and housing for military families, and the elimination of the "widow's tax" that blocked benefits for families of fallen soldiers. Trump praised the military for its achievements and thanked Vice President Mike Pence for his involvement in the creation of the Space Force. He concluded by signing the NDAA into law and wishing the armed forces a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
