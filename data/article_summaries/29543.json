According to a report from the Conference Board, American workers under the age of 35 are now happier with their paychecks than those over the age of 55. This is the first time this has been the case since at least 2011. The report also found that overall job satisfaction in the US is at its highest level in over two decades, with nearly 54% of workers reporting satisfaction with their jobs in 2018. The increase in job satisfaction is attributed to factors such as wage growth and job security, both of which have improved in recent years. Younger workers may be reporting greater happiness with pay because they tend to change jobs more frequently in the early years of their careers, often resulting in a raise. Overall, median weekly earnings rose by 5% in 2018, with workers between the ages of 25 and 34 seeing an increase of 7.6%.
