President Obama visited the Northern Virginia Community College Alexandria Campus to announce initiatives aimed at improving the manufacturing workforce. These initiatives are part of the expansion of Skills for America's Future, an industry-led initiative launched by the Administration last year. During the visit, President Obama toured the campus' Automotive Training Program and saw a General Motors Automotive Services classroom and a lab with Ford hybrid vehicles. The certified automotive services program at NVCC served as a model for a new credentialing program being announced at the event. After the tour, President Obama delivered remarks to an audience of 100 people, including representatives from various organizations, leaders from education and the business community, and NVCC students and faculty.
