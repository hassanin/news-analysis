The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet highlighting the Obama Administration's efforts to build community climate resilience in the face of climate change. The report, titled "Resilience Opportunities," outlines key accomplishments and opportunities for federal agencies and stakeholders to collaborate on climate resilience. The Administration has taken steps to integrate climate-risk considerations into federal operations, improve access to climate data and tools, and invest in building climate-resilient communities. The report identifies three major areas for innovation, economic growth, and collaboration: the application of science-based data and tools, support for community resilience initiatives, and integration of climate resilience into federal agency missions and operations. The report also highlights two specific opportunities. The first is a public-private collaboration called Resilience Dialogues, which provides online consultative services to support communities in their resilience planning. The second opportunity is the commitment of 97 colleges, universities, associations, and academic centers to prepare the next generation of design professionals for extreme weather events and climate change impacts. Federal departments and agencies are also taking new actions to support educational efforts on resilient design.
