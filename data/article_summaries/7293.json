President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has declared a national emergency in response to the widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. This crisis includes urgent needs such as food security, livelihoods support, water, sanitation, health, hygiene, shelter, settlement assistance, and COVID-19-related assistance. The potential for a deepening economic collapse in Afghanistan is also seen as a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. As part of the national emergency declaration, the President has ordered the blocking of all property and interests in property of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) held in the United States by any U.S. financial institution. The blocked property will be transferred into a consolidated account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The order prohibits the transfer, payment, export, withdrawal, or any other dealing with the blocked property, except as specified in the order. The order also applies to transactions that evade or avoid the prohibitions set forth in the order and any conspiracy formed to violate these prohibitions. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, is authorized to take necessary actions to carry out the purposes of this order. The order does not affect the official business of the Federal Government, and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to submit reports to Congress on the national emergency. The order does not impair or affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, nor does it affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The order is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
