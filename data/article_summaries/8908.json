The Quad partners (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States) are launching the Quad Cyber Challenge, a public campaign to improve cybersecurity. They are inviting internet users across the Indo-Pacific and beyond to join the challenge and pledge to practice safe and responsible cyber habits. The goal is to strengthen individuals' and communities' awareness and action towards cybersecurity and create a more secure and resilient cyber ecosystem. The challenge provides resources and training for all users, from corporations to individuals, and will culminate in events during the week of April 10th. The Quad partners aim to ensure that everyone has access to the necessary resources to make informed decisions while online and using smart devices.
