In this statement, the President discusses the need for tax reform in the United States. He criticizes the current corporate tax system, which he believes is outdated, unfair, and inefficient. The President argues that the system provides tax breaks for companies that move jobs and profits overseas, while burdening American companies with high tax rates. He also highlights the complexity of the tax code and its impact on small businesses. 

To address these issues, the President's administration has released a framework for tax reform. The framework aims to simplify the tax code, eliminate loopholes and subsidies, and promote job creation within the country. It includes lowering the corporate tax rate, broadening the tax base, and offering further tax cuts for manufacturers producing goods in America. Additionally, the framework introduces a basic minimum tax for multinational companies to prevent them from avoiding their fair share of taxes. The President emphasizes that this reform is fully funded and will not contribute to the deficit.

The President concludes by stating the need to stop rewarding businesses that offshore jobs and instead incentivize companies that create jobs in America.
