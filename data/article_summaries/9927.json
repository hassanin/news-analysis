President Obama commends Chairman Waxman and the Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee for passing the American Clean Energy and Security Act. He believes this bill is a significant step towards creating a new clean energy economy that reduces America's reliance on foreign oil, addresses pollution, and generates millions of jobs. The President appreciates the bill's focus on clean energy incentives and its consideration for sensitive industries and regions. He also praises the committee for bringing together various groups that have previously opposed such efforts, including labor unions, corporate CEOs, environmentalists, and energy companies. President Obama is eager to sign comprehensive legislation in the future.
