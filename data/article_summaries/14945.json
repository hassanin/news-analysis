The article is a letter from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. In the letter, Obama reports that he has issued an Executive Order to take additional steps with respect to national emergencies declared in previous Executive Orders. The order aims to address efforts by foreign individuals to evade U.S. economic and financial sanctions on Iran and Syria. It authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to impose specified measures on foreign persons who have violated or facilitated deceptive transactions related to these sanctions. The measures include prohibitions on all transactions or dealings with these individuals, as well as the suspension of their entry into the United States. The President has delegated the authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to carry out the order's purposes, and all U.S. government agencies are directed to take appropriate measures to implement the order.
