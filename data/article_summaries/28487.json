President Trump's blue-collar, middle-class agenda is benefiting American families across the country. Under his leadership, wages have risen, inequality has decreased, and the unemployment rate reached a 50-year low. His economic agenda aims to rebuild the American middle class by empowering workers, small businesses, and manufacturers. This includes cutting taxes, eliminating unnecessary degree requirements, ending overregulation, and fixing trade deals. President Trump has taken action to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel restrictions from China, holding global health organizations accountable, and stimulating the production of essential medical supplies. The Great American Comeback has resulted in the return of over 1.4 million manufacturing and construction jobs in the past five months alone and the addition of over 11 million jobs since May. President Trump is focused on working for the American people, while reducing the power of the political class.
