The White House has released a National Action Plan for Combating Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB), which outlines key actions to be taken by federal departments and agencies to address the global rise of MDR-TB. TB is responsible for more deaths than any other infectious disease, killing over 1.5 million people annually. The plan aims to reverse the spread of MDR-TB by implementing targeted interventions and mobilizing political will and financial commitments from donors and affected countries. The plan focuses on strengthening domestic capacity, improving international collaboration, and accelerating research and development. The implementation of the plan will require coordination among US agencies and collaboration with global partners. Over the next five years, the US government will work with various stakeholders to achieve the goals outlined in the plan.
