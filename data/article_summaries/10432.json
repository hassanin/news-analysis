President Barack Obama has issued an Executive Order regarding the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to address the ongoing national emergency in the region. The order takes additional steps to deal with activities that threaten peace, security, and stability in the DRC and the surrounding region. These activities include operations by armed groups, widespread violence and atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment and use of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, obstruction of humanitarian operations, and the exploitation of natural resources to finance these activities. The order amends the designation criteria specified in a previous Executive Order, allowing for the designation of individuals involved in these activities. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, has been given the authority to take necessary actions and employ all powers granted to the President to carry out the purposes of the order. All agencies of the United States Government are directed to take appropriate measures to carry out the provisions of the order.
