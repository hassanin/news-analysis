President Obama announced $5 billion in grant awards under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to fund medical research in every state. The grants are expected to create tens of thousands of jobs and are part of a $100 billion investment in science and technology. The funding will support a range of medical research areas, including heart disease, autism, HIV-AIDS, H1N1 flu, and cancer. Over $1 billion of the funding will be dedicated to research using technology from the Human Genome Project, with a focus on studying genomic changes linked to cancer and other diseases. The investment includes $175 million for The Cancer Genome Atlas, which aims to collect tissue samples and determine genetic changes in thousands of tumor samples. This funding is seen as a significant step forward in understanding cancer and could lead to new treatments and personalized care. More information about the grants can be found on the NIH website.
