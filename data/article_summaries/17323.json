This article is a notice from the President of the United States, Barack Obama, regarding the annual renewal of the national emergency with respect to Burma. The President issued Executive Order 13047 on May 20, 1997, certifying to Congress that the Government of Burma had committed large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in the country. This certification invoked a prohibition on new investment in Burma by US persons. The President also declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed to national security and foreign policy by the actions and policies of the Government of Burma. This national emergency was declared under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The President states that because the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency and the measures adopted to deal with it must continue beyond May 20, 2011. Therefore, the President is continuing the national emergency for one year in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
