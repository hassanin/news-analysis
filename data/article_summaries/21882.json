The United States recognizes that extremist groups in Africa are causing harm to communities, hindering economic growth, and posing a threat to the security and prosperity of Africans. The US is committed to working with African partners to address immediate threats and build durable security sector institutions. The US and African partners are using a comprehensive approach that includes military, diplomacy, financial action, intelligence, law enforcement, and development. The US is enhancing military capacity by providing equipment and specialized training to African partners. Law enforcement capacity is being strengthened through training on preventing, detecting, and investigating terrorism threats. Efforts are also being made to restrict terrorists' travel and access to resources, as well as drying up potential sources of recruits. The US is building global partnerships and has co-founded the Global Counterterrorism Forum to enhance global cooperation. President Obama has asked Congress to create a counterterrorism partnerships fund to provide additional training, equipment, and support for partner states. The US is providing support to countries on the front lines, such as Nigeria and Somalia, to combat terrorist threats. Efforts are also being made to combat groups like AQIM in Mali and extremist groups in North Africa. The US is working with African partners to build capacity, address the underlying causes of radicalization, and amplify local voices against violence.
