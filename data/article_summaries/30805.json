The D.C. Circuit has affirmed a hospital price transparency rule implemented by the Trump Administration, which aims to provide American patients with access to pricing information starting from January 1. The rule has faced opposition from those who wish to maintain the status quo, but President Trump remains committed to bringing transparency to healthcare costs. This is part of a larger effort to introduce unprecedented price transparency across all aspects of healthcare.
