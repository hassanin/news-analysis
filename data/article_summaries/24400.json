The White House is requesting the Senate to ratify the Convention between the United States and Poland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income. This proposed Convention replaces the existing Convention signed in 1974 and aims to bring US-Poland tax treaty relations in line with current US tax treaty policies. It includes provisions to address "treaty shopping," which is the misuse of a tax treaty by residents of a third country. The Department of the Treasury has prioritized concluding this Convention with Poland. President Barack Obama recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the proposed Convention and provide its advice and consent for ratification.
