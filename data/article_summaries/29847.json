In his remarks at the 45th March for Life event, President Trump thanked Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen for their support of the pro-life movement. He expressed his pride in being the first president to address the March for Life at the White House and commended the attendees for their dedication to building a society that celebrates and protects life. Trump criticized the permissive abortion laws in the United States, including late-term abortions, and stated that his administration will always defend the right to life. He highlighted the achievements of his administration, such as the strong economy and low unemployment rates, and mentioned his support for the Pain-Capable bill and the protection of religious liberty. Trump also announced a new proposal to protect the conscience rights and religious freedoms of medical professionals and the reversal of the previous administration's policy on Medicaid funding for abortion facilities. The President shared the story of Marianne Donadio, who chose life and started a maternity home to help homeless pregnant women, as an example of the hope and support provided by the pro-life movement. He concluded by emphasizing the importance of marching, praying, and declaring that America's future will be filled with life and dignity for every child.
