President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Maryland due to a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in January 2016. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and snow assistance in certain counties and cities. Funding will also be available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Donald L. Keldsen as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
