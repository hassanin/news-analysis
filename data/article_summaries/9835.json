On August 17, 2009, the White House released a statement by the Press Secretary regarding the release of American citizen John Yettaw from detention in Burma. The President expressed his appreciation for Senator Webb's role in facilitating the release and noted that Senator Webb was able to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi, the first meeting by a U.S. official with her in many years. The statement also urged the Burmese leadership to release all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, who were being held in detention or house arrest.
