President Barack Obama has proclaimed November 22 through November 28, 2015, as National Family Week in the United States. The proclamation recognizes the importance of families as a foundation of society and highlights the efforts the government has made to support working families, such as providing access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and pushing for paid family leave. The proclamation also emphasizes the need to raise the minimum wage to help working families, provide strong and flexible retirement plans for seniors, and improve mental health care and education services for veterans and their families. The President calls on all Americans to reflect on and appreciate the hard work and dedication of their families and to strengthen family bonds. The proclamation encourages states, communities, and individuals to observe National Family Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
