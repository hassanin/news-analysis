The White House Press Secretary has issued a statement expressing appreciation for the agreement reached by House and Senate leaders on the Iran Sanctions Conference Report. The statement highlights that the bill strengthens the strategy to isolate and pressure Iran, grants new authority to the President, and builds upon the recently passed UN Security Council Resolution. The White House will continue to work with Congress to finalize the bill and hold Iran accountable. Additionally, the statement mentions that the administration will collaborate with allies and take independent action under the President's existing authorities, as demonstrated by the recent designation of additional entities for sanctions.
