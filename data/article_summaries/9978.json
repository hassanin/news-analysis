Five years ago, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) came into effect. This agreement limits the United States and Russia to no more than 1,550 deployed warheads and caps both sides at no more than 700 deployed delivery vehicles. These limits will be enforced starting in February 2018. The treaty provides transparency into Russia's nuclear capabilities and stability in managing the nuclear forces of both countries. The United States calls on Russia to engage in talks for further reductions in nuclear weapons. The treaty contributes to the security of the United States and its allies. However, the United States remains committed to reducing the overall number of nuclear weapons in the world and maintaining a safe and effective nuclear deterrent.
