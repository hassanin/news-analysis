Robert Wolf, President of UBS Investment Bank and member of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, supports the American Jobs Act, particularly its focus on infrastructure as a way to create jobs. He cites macroeconomic models that show that $1 of infrastructure spending boosts GDP by approximately a 1.6 multiplier, which has a larger effect on GDP and employment than most other types of spending. The Milken Institute estimates that every $1 billion spent on infrastructure creates over 25,000 jobs.
