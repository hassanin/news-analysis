President Obama announced the expansion of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) during a town hall meeting in Rangoon, Burma. YSEALI aims to strengthen leadership development in ASEAN, engage young leaders on regional and global challenges, and enhance people-to-people ties between the United States and Southeast Asia. The expansion includes the YSEALI Fellowship, which will bring 500 young leaders from ASEAN countries to the United States annually to develop their professional and leadership skills in areas such as entrepreneurship, environment management, and civic engagement. The fellows will be divided into YSEALI Academic Fellows and YSEALI Professional Fellows. The program will also include regional workshops, grant competitions, and a YSEALI summit in 2015. YSEALI also includes the YSEALI Generation Regional Exchanges, which provide professional development workshops for emerging leaders in ASEAN. Additionally, the program offers YSEALI Seeds for the Future grants to support young leaders' innovative ideas in areas such as civic engagement, education, entrepreneurship, and environment management. The United States is also working on science, technology, and entrepreneurship initiatives and addressing the demand for skilled labor through the Connecting the Mekong through Education and Training (COMET) program. The United States encourages civic engagement through programs like the ASEAN Youth Volunteer Program and the establishment of the Center for Civil Society and Non-Profit Management at Thailand's Khon Kaen University.
