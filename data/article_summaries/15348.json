On June 3, 2016, the President signed two laws into effect. The first law, H.R. 2814, designates a Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic in Sevierville, Tennessee as the Dannie A. Carr Veterans Outpatient Clinic. The second law, S. 184, known as the "Native American Children's Safety Act," amends the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act to require background checks before foster care placements are made by tribal social services agencies.
