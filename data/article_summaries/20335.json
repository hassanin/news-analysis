President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the Commonwealth of Kentucky, ordering federal aid to supplement recovery efforts from severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from April 22, 2011, onwards. The federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and emergency protective measures in specific counties. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive cost-sharing funding statewide. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is conducting damage surveys in other areas, and additional counties may be designated for assistance after assessments are complete. For more information, contact FEMA.
