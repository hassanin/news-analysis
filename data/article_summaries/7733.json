On April 8, 2022, the President signed two bills into law. The first one, H.R. 6968, called the "Ending Importation of Russian Oil Act," prohibits the importation of energy products from Russia. The second one, H.R. 7108, known as the "Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act," suspends normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus. The goal of this bill is to use trade and human rights sanctions to put pressure on these countries.
