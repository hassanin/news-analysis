President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. has authorized additional disaster assistance for the state of Louisiana in response to the damage caused by Hurricane Ida. The President has increased the level of federal funding for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Initially, a 100 percent federal cost share was authorized for debris removal and emergency protective measures for a period of 30 days. Now, President Biden has extended the period of 100 percent federal funding to 45 days. The federal share for all categories of Public Assistance, except for previously authorized 100 percent assistance, has also been increased to 90 percent of the total eligible costs.
