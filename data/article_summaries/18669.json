The White House Press Secretary released a statement emphasizing the importance of Congress addressing the debt limit. The statement highlights that there are two options: Congress can either pay its bills or fail to act, leading to a default. The statement also criticizes Congressional Republicans for playing politics with the debt limit in the past, which negatively impacted the economy and led to a credit rating downgrade. The President and the American people are not willing to tolerate Republicans holding the economy hostage in order to force cuts to Medicare and other programs that the middle class relies on, while protecting the wealthy. The statement concludes by urging Congress to fulfill its responsibilities.
