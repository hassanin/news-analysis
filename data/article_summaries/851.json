The Biden-Harris Administration's new Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) income-driven repayment plan for student loans has seen over 4 million borrowers nationwide enroll. The plan offers affordable repayment options, with borrowers earning less than $15 an hour not required to make payments, and those earning more saving over $1000 on payments. The plan also prevents borrowers' balances from growing due to unpaid interest as long as payments are made. Local news outlets across the country have reported on the number of borrowers in each state who have enrolled in the SAVE plan, with enrollments ranging from thousands to over 100,000 in some states. The plan is seen as a way to reduce the burden of student loan debt for millions of borrowers.
