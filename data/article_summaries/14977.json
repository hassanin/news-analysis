President Obama will make a statement at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the election results and how the country can come together after a contentious election season. He has invited President-elect Donald Trump to meet with him on Thursday to update him on the transition planning that has been underway for nearly a year. Ensuring a smooth transition of power is a top priority for President Obama, and meeting with the President-elect is the next step in that process.
