The Biden administration is implementing a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the economy and reduce costs for working families. This includes addressing supply chain issues, making the economy more competitive, and advocating for legislation to lower everyday expenses and promote domestic manufacturing. President Biden will discuss how to lower prescription drug prices for working Americans in Virginia. Despite the progress made in the economic recovery, the US, along with other countries, is experiencing increased price inflation due to the pandemic. President Biden's plan involves respecting the independence of the Federal Reserve to prevent sustained price increases. Additionally, the focus is on building a more productive economy that offers more choices, supports small businesses, and facilitates faster and cheaper market access. This involves fixing supply chains and infrastructure, making more products in the US, and addressing challenges in transportation, semiconductors, and agriculture. The administration is also committed to reducing living costs for families through investments in health care, child care, and prescription drugs, as well as promoting competition to lower prices and provide more options for consumers.
