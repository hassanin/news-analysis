The President is pleased that the Senate has passed the America Invents Act, which is the most significant patent reform in over half a century. This reform is important in modernizing America's patent laws and reducing the backlog of patent applications. It will increase transparency and certainty for inventors, entrepreneurs, and businesses, and help grow the economy and create jobs. The President thanks Senators Leahy, Grassley, and Hatch for their leadership and looks forward to working with the House of Representatives to pass patent reform legislation.
