The article discusses a regulatory flaw called the "family glitch" that has prevented many Americans from accessing affordable health insurance. Under this glitch, employer-based health insurance is considered affordable for the employee, even if it is not affordable for their family members. As a result, those family members are ineligible for Affordable Care Act subsidies. However, the Treasury Department is finalizing a fix for this issue, which will allow families to access more affordable coverage. Starting next month, around 1 million Americans will either gain coverage or see their insurance become more affordable. This is seen as the most significant administrative action to implement the Affordable Care Act since its inception. The aim is to lower costs and expand quality, affordable health coverage for all Americans. The article encourages everyone to visit HealthCare.gov starting November 1st to sign up for a plan that suits their needs.
