The White House is announcing a new Federal Automated Vehicles Policy to encourage the safe and responsible deployment of automated vehicles. The policy aims to make transportation safer, cleaner, more accessible, and more efficient. The policy builds on previous investments in the automotive industry and proposes a $4 billion investment in automated vehicle deployment through real-world pilots. The policy highlights the potential benefits of automated vehicles, such as improved safety, mobility, productivity, and sustainability. The policy package includes vehicle performance guidance, a model for state policy, current regulatory tools, and new tools and authorities that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) could consider seeking in the future. The NHTSA is also releasing a final enforcement guidance bulletin clarifying its recall authority for automated vehicle technologies. The policy will be updated annually to reflect public input. The Administration will also be taking additional actions, including implementation and continuous improvement of the policy, smart cities commitments, a White House Frontiers Conference, cybersecurity best practices, and a proposed rule for connected vehicles.
