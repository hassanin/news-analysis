On August 1, 2007, the President issued Executive Order 13441 declaring a national emergency with respect to Lebanon. This was done to address the threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by certain individuals undermining Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government and democratic institutions. These actions also contributed to the breakdown of the rule of law in Lebanon, including politically motivated violence and intimidation, as well as Syrian control or interference in Lebanon. These actions further undermined Lebanese sovereignty and contributed to political and economic instability in Lebanon and the region. The national emergency, along with the measures adopted to deal with it, must continue in effect beyond August 1, 2017. Therefore, the President is continuing the national emergency for one year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
