The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer antiviral pill, a promising new treatment for COVID-19. This oral treatment is expected to significantly reduce hospitalization and death, especially in the face of the more transmissible Omicron variant. The United States has pre-purchased 10 million treatment courses, more than any other country, and production will increase in the coming months. Over 250,000 treatment courses will be available in January, with a focus on equitable distribution to the hardest-hit communities. This development is a result of American innovation and the power of science, and the government will provide any necessary resources, including using the Defense Production Act. With widespread vaccination, boosters, testing, and now an additional treatment option, the US is better prepared than ever to combat the virus and save lives.
