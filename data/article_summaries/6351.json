Today, Special Assistant to the President for Gender Policy Latifa Lyles, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chair Charlotte Burrows, and Principal Deputy Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division at the U.S. Department of Labor Jessica Looman hosted a roundtable conversation to discuss the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) and the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act. These laws, signed by President Biden in December 2022, aim to ensure that workers have access to good jobs and discrimination-free workplaces. The event included workers, employers, advocates, and unions, who discussed how the PWFA will enable pregnant and postpartum workers to request reasonable accommodations and stay in their jobs. Additionally, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act extends break time and private space protections for nursing parents to nine million workers. The officials shared new resources to help workers and employers understand their rights and emphasized the administration's commitment to supporting the well-being and economic security of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women.
