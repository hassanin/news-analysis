President Trump hosted a tribal, state, and local energy roundtable at the White House. He was joined by several governors and state and tribal leaders. The President expressed his intention to roll back regulations that hinder access to energy resources, which he believes would promote economic growth and job creation. He hopes that the roundtable will encourage cooperation between local governments and his administration to unleash America's energy potential and achieve energy dominance.
