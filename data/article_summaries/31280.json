The White House Coronavirus Task Force has recommended 30-day mitigation strategies for Seattle-King, Pierce, and Snohomish County in Washington, and Santa Clara County in California. These strategies are aimed at addressing the effects of COVID-19 in areas experiencing community spread. The Task Force, along with the CDC, has worked closely with state and local leaders to develop these strategies, and CDC teams are on the ground in these areas to respond to the situation. The recommendations include extensive community mitigation activities to protect the health and safety of the people. Examples of these strategies include social distancing, school closures, and limiting large gatherings. The Task Force considered guidance from multiple federal agencies in making these recommendations, and they will be reassessed after 30 days.
