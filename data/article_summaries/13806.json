Executive Order 13580, issued by President Barack Obama on July 12, 2011, establishes an interagency working group to coordinate the efforts of federal agencies responsible for overseeing the safe and responsible development of onshore and offshore energy resources in Alaska. The order aims to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil while ensuring the protection of human health, the environment, and indigenous populations. The working group, led by the Department of the Interior, includes representatives from various agencies such as the Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security, Environmental Protection Agency, and the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects. The order also emphasizes the need for interagency coordination with relevant federal policy initiatives and the sharing of information and best practices among agencies. The working group's functions include facilitating decision-making on permits and environmental reviews, coordinating regulatory and permitting activities, sharing project information, promoting long-term planning, engaging with states, localities, and tribal governments, collaborating on stakeholder outreach, and facilitating interagency dialogue with the industry. The order specifies that it should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The Department of the Interior will provide administrative support for the working group, and the order does not impair the authority of executive departments, agencies, or the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
