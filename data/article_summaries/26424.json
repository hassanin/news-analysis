The article is a letter from President Donald J. Trump to the Speaker of the House regarding the national security threat posed by imports of titanium sponge into the United States. The President concurs with the Secretary of Commerce's finding that the imports of titanium sponge threaten the national security of the United States. However, instead of taking actions to adjust imports, the President directs the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Commerce to form a working group and invite their counterparts in Japan to discuss measures to ensure access to titanium sponge in the United States for national defense and critical industries during emergencies. The President also directs the Secretary of Defense to take appropriate action, including using delegated authorities under the Defense Production Act and seeking new appropriations, to increase access to titanium sponge for national defense and critical industries and to support domestic production capacity. The progress of these efforts will be periodically updated to the President.
