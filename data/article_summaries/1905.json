During a recent press briefing, officials provided updates on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic and the preparations for vaccinating children ages 5 through 11. Dr. Walensky reported that there has been a decrease in cases, hospital admissions, and deaths. The CDC's COVID Data Tracker now includes data on COVID-19 outcomes by vaccination status, showing that unvaccinated individuals have a higher risk of testing positive for COVID-19 and dying from it compared to fully vaccinated individuals. Vaccination also prevents hospitalizations. The CDC is monitoring the emergence of new variants, including the AY 4.2 variant, but there is currently no evidence that it impacts the effectiveness of vaccines. Dr. Fauci provided a historical perspective on the impact of vaccines and emphasized the importance of COVID-19 vaccination for children. The officials discussed the preparations for vaccinating children ages 5 through 11, including securing vaccine supply, enrolling healthcare providers, and making vaccination convenient and accessible. They also highlighted the need to address vaccine hesitancy and provide accurate information to parents. The officials emphasized that the decision on authorizing the vaccine for children ages 5 through 11 is up to the FDA and CDC.
