The U.S. government has reached an agreement with Venezuela to secure the release of six Americans who have been wrongfully detained in the country. This brings the total number of Americans released from Venezuela to 19. As part of the agreement, Leonard Francis, also known as "Fat Leonard," will be extradited from Venezuela and returned to the United States to face charges for his involvement in a bribery conspiracy within the U.S. Navy. The release of the Americans is the result of months of negotiations and consultations with senior administration officials. The U.S. government is also working towards encouraging Venezuela to hold competitive elections and restore democracy in the country. The release of the Americans and other prisoners is seen as a positive step towards achieving these goals. The U.S. government has not offered sanctions relief in exchange for the release of the Americans. The sanctions relief provided earlier this year remains in place and is contingent on continued progress towards competitive elections in Venezuela. The U.S. government has made it clear that it expects no further detentions of Americans in Venezuela and will take appropriate actions if this expectation is not met.
