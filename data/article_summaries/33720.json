President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of California due to severe winter storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred from February 13 to February 15, 2019. This declaration allows for Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available to State and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Calaveras, Colusa, Marin, Mariposa, Mendocino, Modoc, Napa, Riverside, Santa Barbara, Shasta, and Trinity. Hazard mitigation measures will also be funded on a cost-sharing basis statewide.
