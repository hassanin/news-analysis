On September 12, 2018, President Biden declared a national emergency due to the threat of foreign interference in United States elections. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. While there has been no evidence of foreign powers altering election outcomes or vote tabulation, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has created vulnerabilities and magnified the intensity of the threat. The ability of individuals located outside the United States to undermine public confidence in elections through unauthorized access to election infrastructure or the distribution of propaganda and disinformation continues to pose a significant threat. As a result, President Biden has announced the continuation of the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
