According to an article in the Washington Examiner, US manufacturers are feeling optimistic about the future. The article states that the GOP-led tax cuts and President Trump's deregulation efforts are driving this record-high optimism. A survey conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers found that nearly 89 percent of the 539 companies polled in the fourth quarter held a positive outlook for their business. This brings the yearly average to 92.4 percent, the highest in the survey's 20-year history. The article also notes that concerns about an unfavorable business climate have significantly decreased, and companies expect increases in capital investments, full-time employment, and wages in the next 12 months. The President of the National Association of Manufacturers, Jay Timmons, commented that this year's optimism levels were "one for the record books."
