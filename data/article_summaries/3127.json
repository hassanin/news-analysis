Jill and I are sending warm greetings to Muslims celebrating Eid al-Adha. This occasion allows Muslims to renew their faith and reflects the common roots of Abrahamic religions. Despite COVID-19 restrictions, Muslims are gathering for Hajj, symbolizing progress in fighting the pandemic. We should all renew our commitment to peace, caring for the vulnerable, and pursuing equality and opportunity. Muslim Americans are actively assisting those in need, both domestically and internationally. Jill and I wish everyone a joyous holiday filled with community, celebration, compassion, and service. Eid Mubarak and Hajj Mabroor!
