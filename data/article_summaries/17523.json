In this letter, Ed DeSeve, who coordinates the implementation of the Recovery Act, responds to Representative Boehner's concerns about whether the Act has created or saved jobs. DeSeve cites the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's report estimating that 600,000 to 1.6 million jobs have been created or saved by the Act. He also mentions economist Mark Zandi's statement that there are over 1.1 million more jobs as of October because of the Act. DeSeve addresses Boehner's doubts about "saved" jobs, stating that many teachers, construction workers, firefighters, and police officers are still employed because of the Act. He also mentions that both Republican and Democratic governors, recipients of Recovery Act funds, and independent economists have confirmed the creation and saving of jobs. DeSeve acknowledges that the measure of direct jobs saved and created may be subject to revision but argues that the overall confirmation of at least 1 million jobs created or saved by the Act is irrefutable. He concludes by agreeing with Boehner that the 640,000 figure for direct jobs created and saved is approximate and not the best representation of the Act's job creation.
