President Donald J. Trump commends the House of Representatives for passing the "Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017." This bipartisan legislation equips Federal prosecutors and State officials with necessary tools to combat sex trafficking. However, the Administration has reservations about certain provisions in the bill, as outlined in the Department of Justice's technical assistance. The President hopes these concerns can be addressed in the final version of the bill before it is presented to him for signing. President Trump remains committed to working with Congress to ensure that individuals involved in human trafficking are held accountable for their heinous actions.
