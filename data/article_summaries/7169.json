The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to close the infrastructure gap in developing countries, strengthen the global economy and supply chains, and advance U.S. national security. President Biden plans to announce new flagship projects and outline the comprehensive effort of the administration to execute the partnership. The PGII was announced at the 2021 G7 Summit, where President Biden and G7 leaders expressed their intention to develop a values-driven, high-impact, and transparent infrastructure partnership to meet the infrastructure needs of low- and middle-income countries. The U.S. aims to mobilize $200 billion for PGII over the next 5 years through grants, federal financing, and leveraging private sector investments. Together with G7 partners, the goal is to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 in global infrastructure investments. President Biden will release a Presidential Memorandum to execute the PGII across four priority pillars. The partnership will showcase how millions of dollars can mobilize further investments in the tens or hundreds of millions, and how tens or hundreds of millions can mobilize billions.
