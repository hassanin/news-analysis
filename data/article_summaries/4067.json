Yesterday, President Biden signed an executive order to prioritize environmental justice and address the impacts of pollution and climate change on marginalized communities. The order aims to bring clean energy, healthy environments, and equitable access to resources like clean air, water, housing, and transportation. The President's action is part of his broader agenda to promote environmental justice, create jobs in clean energy industries, and meet climate goals. The order has received praise from leaders across the country, including members of Congress and environmental justice advocates, who commend the administration for taking historic action and committing to work with communities to implement effective policies. They emphasize the importance of addressing environmental injustices that have disproportionately affected low-income communities, communities of color, and Indigenous communities. The executive order is seen as a significant step forward, although more work is needed to achieve true environmental justice.
