This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama, announcing the establishment of the Fort Ord National Monument. The Fort Ord area, located in California's Central Coast, is known for its natural beauty, historical significance, and biodiversity. The area was traversed by Spanish settlers led by Lieutenant Colonel Juan Bautista de Anza in the late 1700s and played a role in the military training of American soldiers throughout the 20th century. The former Fort Ord has become a popular destination for outdoor recreation, scientific research, and tourism, attracting nearly 100,000 visitors each year. The proclamation declares that all lands owned or controlled by the US government within the boundaries of the Fort Ord National Monument are reserved and set apart for the purpose of protecting and restoring the area's historical, cultural, and natural resources. The management of the monument will be carried out by the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of the Army, with a transportation plan to be developed to provide visitor access and enjoyment while preserving the scientific and historic objects. The proclamation also emphasizes the protection of valid existing rights, the responsibility of the Department of the Army for environmental remediation, and the jurisdiction of the State of California in fish and wildlife management.
