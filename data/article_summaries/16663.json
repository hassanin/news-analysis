Deputy National Security Advisor Michael Froman and Attorney General Eric Holder will lead a high-level delegation to Doha, Qatar for the inaugural Arab Forum on Asset Recovery. The United States is co-organizing the forum with the government of Qatar. The purpose of the forum is to address corruption in the Middle East and North Africa region and support democratic transitions. The United States, as the president of the G8 in 2012, is leading a coalition to focus on asset recovery as part of the Deauville Partnership. The forum will bring together G8 countries, the Deauville Partnership, regional countries, and international organizations to advance this work.
