In a speech at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, President Biden addressed the struggles faced by American small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. He highlighted the impact on communities and the disproportionate effect on black, Latino, and Asian American communities. President Biden announced changes to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to prioritize small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. The Small Business Administration will establish a 14-day exclusive loan application period for these businesses and remove barriers that have prevented certain businesses from applying. The President emphasized the need for Congress to pass his American Rescue Plan, which includes $50 billion to support small businesses. He also proposed bringing in community organizations as "navigators" to assist businesses with the application process and establishing a hotline for support. President Biden acknowledged criticisms that the plan is too large but argued that it is necessary to help struggling businesses and promote economic recovery. He urged bipartisan support for the American Rescue Plan and emphasized the importance of acting quickly. Economists, mayors, and governors have expressed support for the plan, believing it will create jobs and strengthen the economy. The President concluded by reiterating his commitment to supporting small businesses and the communities they serve.
