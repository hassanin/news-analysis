This article provides facts and figures on the drawdown of U.S. troops in Iraq. President Barack Obama announced in 2009 that the combat mission in Iraq would end by August 31, 2010, and a transitional force of up to 50,000 U.S. troops would remain to train and advise Iraqi Security Forces. By January 2010, there were 112,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, and by the end of May 2010, that number had been reduced to 88,000. The final tranche of the drawdown began in June 2010, and by the end of August 2010, the number of U.S. troops in Iraq would be further reduced to 50,000. The transitional mission would be called Operation New Dawn, and all U.S. troops were scheduled to leave Iraq by the end of 2011. The article also mentions that there are currently 665,000 Iraqi Security Forces leading the effort to secure Iraq. The reduction in troops does not mean a reduction in the U.S. commitment to Iraq but rather a change in the nature of the commitment from military-led to civilian-led. The U.S. and Iraq signed a Strategic Framework Agreement to guide the expansion of their relationship. In terms of equipment, the total number of equipment in Iraq would be reduced from 3.4 million pieces in January 2009 to 1.2 million pieces by the end of August 2010. The equipment would be moved to U.S. troops in Afghanistan, to replenish U.S. military stocks, and to Iraqi Security Forces. U.S. forces are also closing or transferring military bases in Iraq as part of the drawdown. The article also provides information on the number of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. In January 2009, there were about 177,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and by September 2010, there would be about 146,000 troops. The drawdown of U.S. forces from Iraq since January 2009 is roughly three times as many troops as the President ordered to Afghanistan last December.
