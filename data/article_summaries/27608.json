On July 15, 2019, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to promote the principles underlying the Buy American Act of 1933. The order emphasizes the policy of the United States to buy American and maximize the use of goods, products, and materials produced in the country. The administration aims to enforce the Buy American Act to its fullest extent within the bounds of the law. The order directs the members of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) to review and revise the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to better carry out the goals of the Buy American Act. The FAR Council is given 180 days to propose amendments to the FAR that would define materials as foreign origin if the cost of foreign products exceeds certain percentages of the overall cost. The order also calls for the FAR Council to determine the reasonableness and public interest of bids or offered prices for materials of foreign origin based on a differential formula. Public comments on the proposed regulations will be considered, and a final rule will be issued if appropriate. The head of each executive agency is required to issue necessary regulations to align with the final rule. The order supersedes Executive Order 10582 and revokes subsections 2(a) and 2(c) of that order. Additionally, the Secretary of Commerce and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget are instructed to submit a report to the President within 180 days on any further changes to the FAR to better enforce the Buy American Act. The report should include recommendations on potentially decreasing the threshold percentage for foreign products. The order clarifies that it does not impair existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits enforceable by any party.
