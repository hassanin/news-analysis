President Donald J. Trump delivered a speech on tax reform at the Mandan Refinery in North Dakota. He emphasized that the current tax code is hindering economic growth and proposed four principles for his Administration's new tax plan. These principles include simplifying the tax code, providing the largest tax cut for middle-class families since President Reagan, cutting the business tax rate, and bringing back wealth held overseas. The goal is to stimulate the economy, create jobs, raise wages, and rebuild American cities and communities.
