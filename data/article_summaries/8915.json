President Biden will host the United We Stand Summit at the White House on September 15. The summit aims to address the corrosive effects of hate-fueled violence on democracy and public safety, highlight the response of the Biden-Harris Administration and communities nationwide, and promote a shared vision for a more united America. President Biden's decision to run for president was influenced by the hate-fueled violence that occurred in Charlottesville in 2017. Since taking office, his administration has taken steps to counter hate-motivated violence, including signing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, releasing the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, and signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The summit will bring together individuals from various backgrounds, including survivors of hate-fueled violence, and will feature keynote speeches, bipartisan panels, and conversations on countering hate-fueled violence, preventing radicalization, and fostering unity. The goal is to encourage Americans to unite in their opposition to such violence and work together towards a more united nation.
