President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for Puerto Rico, providing federal aid to supplement recovery efforts after severe storms, flooding, mudslides, and landslides that occurred between May 20 and June 8, 2011. The declaration allows for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures in various municipalities. Justo Hern√°ndez has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments.
