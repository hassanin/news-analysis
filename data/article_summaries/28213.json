The U.S. economy experienced a strong acceleration in 2017, with real gross domestic product (GDP) growing at 2.5 percent, up from 1.8 percent in 2016. The unemployment rate also dropped to 4.1 percent, the lowest since 2000. In addition, 2.2 million nonfarm jobs were added to the economy, with particular strength in the manufacturing and mining sectors. However, there are challenges ahead, including low labor productivity growth and long-term downward trends in labor force participation due to the aging population. The government's forecast for the longer term is for output to grow by an average annual rate of 2.2 percent through 2028, excluding the effects of the recent tax cuts. With the implementation of the government's agenda, the forecast is for real GDP to grow by 3.0 percent per year on average through 2028. However, growth is expected to moderate slightly after 2020. The government's long-term forecast is conservative compared to previous administrations, and it expects deregulation and infrastructure investment to contribute to GDP growth beyond 2020.
