President Obama and Prime Minister Renzi of Italy spoke about the ongoing situation in Ukraine. They both emphasized the importance of the Ukrainian government and separatist groups continuing their discussions to implement President Poroshenko's peace plan. They also stressed the need for Russia to use its influence to persuade the separatists to abide by the cease-fire and to take immediate steps to stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border. The leaders agreed to coordinate measures to impose additional costs on Russia if it does not take swift action to deescalate the situation in eastern Ukraine.
