On December 8, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order regarding the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). The order approves a new seal of office for the NCUA, which includes an eagle overlaid by a shield representing the agency's role as a federal government agency. The seal also incorporates the NCUA's title, "National Credit Union Administration," and the date "1934," reflecting the agency's history and the creation of the Federal credit union system. The order revokes a previous executive order from 1971 that established a different seal for the NCUA. The order includes general provisions stating that it does not affect the authority of other executive departments or agencies, and that it is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations. The order does not create any legal rights or benefits.
