The Obama Administration has released a National Ocean Policy action plan to address the challenges facing ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources. The plan aims to improve the health of these areas, which support millions of jobs and contribute trillions of dollars to the national economy. The plan focuses on public-private partnerships, efficiency, collaboration, and the use of scientific data to make informed decisions. Some key actions include streamlining permitting processes, improving water quality, providing climate change forecasts, and improving environmental response management in the Arctic. The plan also aims to support emerging sustainable uses of resources, provide open access to data, identify grant opportunities, assess the resilience of natural resources, and conserve fish habitat. The draft plan is open for public comment until February 27th.
