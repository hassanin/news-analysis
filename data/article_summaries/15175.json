The Hispanic Federation has expressed strong support for President Obama's proposal to create jobs and provide relief for the unemployed. They believe that the President's plan will help unemployed Americans provide for themselves and their families, offer tax relief for small businesses and individuals, enhance summer youth employment programs, strengthen schools, and address the long-term unemployment rate that has disproportionately affected Hispanics. The Hispanic Federation urges elected leaders to quickly pass these reforms in order to help millions of Hispanics regain economic prosperity.
