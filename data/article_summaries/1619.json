He emphasized the importance of uniting countries, private sectors, civil society, and philanthropic communities to fight the pandemic globally. The United States has provided over $19 billion in aid to countries fighting COVID-19, including vaccines, medicines, oxygen, tests, and equipment.

President Biden acknowledged the ongoing challenges and marked the tragic milestone of one million COVID deaths in the United States. He urged everyone to double down on efforts to vaccinate, ensure reliable supplies, expand access to tests and treatments, and prevent complacency. The summit served as an opportunity to renew commitments and prepare for future health crises. The United States announced it would share critical COVID-19 technologies through the World Health Organization COVID-19 Technology Access Pool and establish a new pilot program to expand access to rapid testing and antiviral treatments. They also increased support for a new Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security fund at the World Bank. President Biden called on Congress to provide emergency COVID-19 funding and emphasized the need for global partnership in the fight against COVID-19. He concluded by expressing gratitude to frontline workers and those fighting the pandemic every day.
