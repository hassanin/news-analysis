On September 12, 2018, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency due to the threat of foreign interference in United States elections. Although there has been no evidence of foreign powers altering election outcomes, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has increased the vulnerabilities and intensity of this threat. The ability of individuals outside the United States to interfere in elections, such as accessing election infrastructure or distributing propaganda, continues to pose a significant threat to national security and foreign policy. As a result, President Trump has extended the national emergency for one more year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
