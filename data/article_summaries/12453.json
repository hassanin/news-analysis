He also discussed recent cross-border attacks that threaten the peace between the two countries. The United States expressed deep concern over the ongoing fighting and the humanitarian crisis caused by the Sudanese government's blocking of international humanitarian assistance. The meetings also focused on U.S.-Sudan relations, resolving post-Comprehensive Peace Agreement issues between Sudan and South Sudan, and bringing peace and justice to Darfur. In Juba, the importance of respecting Sudan's sovereignty and ending support for the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement-North in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile was emphasized. The meetings also explored ways to make progress in resolving the remaining post-Comprehensive Peace Agreement issues.
