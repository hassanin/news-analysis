President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 with respect to Yemen is to continue in effect beyond May 16, 2014. The actions and policies of certain members of the Yemeni government and others continue to threaten Yemen's peace, security, and stability. These actions include obstructing the implementation of the November 23, 2011 agreement between the Yemeni government and opposition groups, which aimed to achieve a peaceful transition of power. As a result, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611.
