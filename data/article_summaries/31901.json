The Trump Administration is launching its next phase in the fight against America's opioid epidemic, coinciding with National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. The opioid crisis is a major problem in the US, with roughly 130 Americans dying every day from an opioid overdose. The annual economic cost of the crisis is estimated to exceed $504 billion. However, there are signs of progress, as the number of overdose deaths from opioids declined for the first time in 2018. To capitalize on this success, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) has released a plan called "Health Research and Development to Stem the Opioid Crisis: A National Roadmap." This plan aims to coordinate federal research and development efforts to combat the opioid crisis. The National Roadmap includes eight recommendations to strengthen and expand research efforts. The plan was shaped by public input from various perspectives, including those personally impacted by the crisis, healthcare providers, public health departments, private-sector leaders, and non-profit organizations. In addition to the National Roadmap, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has announced $945 million in research grants to improve treatments for chronic pain, curb addiction rates, and achieve long-term addiction recovery. The Trump Administration is committed to ending the opioid crisis and the National Roadmap provides a framework for continuing the fight.
