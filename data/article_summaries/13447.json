President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Mississippi due to flooding and has ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. This declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in several counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for property losses. Hazard mitigation measures are also eligible for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Terry L. Quarles as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are still ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by calling FEMA. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate seven days a week until further notice. Further information can be obtained from FEMA.
