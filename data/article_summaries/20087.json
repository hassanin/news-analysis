President Obama has declared a major disaster in North Carolina and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding on April 16, 2011. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in several counties, providing assistance for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for property losses. Federal funding is also available for state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to cover debris removal and emergency protective measures. Additionally, hazard mitigation measures statewide can receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Michael Bolch has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated in the future. Those who have suffered losses in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will be available seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time. For further information, contact FEMA.
