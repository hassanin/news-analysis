The United States has renewed its commitment to being a responsible steward of its nuclear arsenal and working towards a world without nuclear weapons at the Tenth Review Conference for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The US joined other Nuclear Weapons States in affirming that a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought. The administration has prioritized reducing the role of nuclear weapons in national security strategy. The health of the NPT has always relied on meaningful arms limits between the US and Russia, and the US is ready to negotiate a new arms control framework to replace New START when it expires in 2026. However, negotiation requires a willing partner operating in good faith, and Russia's aggression in Ukraine has disrupted peace in Europe. Russia should demonstrate its readiness to resume work on nuclear arms control. China, as an NPT nuclear weapons state, also has a responsibility to engage in talks to reduce the risk of miscalculation and address destabilizing military dynamics. The US is determined to lead by example and has proposed securing a mutual return to full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The US is also working with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure the AUKUS partnership meets nonproliferation standards and re-establishing leadership in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The US reaffirms its commitment to the nonproliferation regime and seeks to strengthen the nonproliferation architecture.
