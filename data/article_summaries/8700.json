President Biden has asked the Department of Labor to issue the first-ever hazard alert for heat and has announced new investments to protect communities from the impacts of extreme heat. The effects of extreme heat are growing due to the climate crisis, and millions of Americans are currently experiencing its effects. The President met with mayors from Phoenix, Arizona, and San Antonio, Texas, to discuss the impacts of extreme heat on their communities and the steps being taken to protect them. The Department of Labor will increase enforcement of heat-safety violations, particularly in high-risk industries like construction and agriculture. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is also working on developing a national standard for workplace heat-safety rules. The Biden-Harris Administration has already taken actions to bolster heat response and resilience, including providing funding through the Department of Housing and Urban Development for energy-efficient buildings and cooling centers. President Biden has prioritized addressing the climate crisis and has secured significant funding for climate resilience measures. However, many Republicans in Congress deny climate change and oppose climate protection measures.
