President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Grant of Clemency, granting a full pardon to former Army First Lieutenant Michael Behenna of Oklahoma. In 2009, Behenna was sentenced to 25 years in prison for unpremeditated murder in a combat zone. However, the Army's highest appellate court expressed concerns about how the trial court handled Behenna's claim of self-defense. The Army Clemency and Parole Board subsequently reduced his sentence to 15 years and paroled him in 2014, after just 5 years of his sentence. Behenna's case has received support from military officials, Oklahoma elected officials, and the public. Thirty-seven generals and admirals, as well as a former Inspector General of the Department of Defense, signed a brief in support of Behenna's self-defense claim. Various members of the Oklahoma congressional delegation, former Governor Mary Fallin, and current Attorney General Mike Hunter have also expressed their support. Additionally, Behenna was a model prisoner during his sentence. Based on these facts, the pardon is seen as justified.
