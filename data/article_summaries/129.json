The American economy and American workers are experiencing positive developments. The economy created 339,000 jobs last month, bringing the total to over 13 million jobs since President Biden took office. This is more jobs created in 28 months than any President has achieved in a full 4-year term. Additionally, the unemployment rate has remained below 4 percent for 16 consecutive months, a level not seen since the 1960s. The workforce participation rate is also at its highest level in 16 years. Inflation has been decreasing for 10 months and is down over 40 percent since last summer. Despite this, workers' take-home pay has increased even after adjusting for inflation. President Biden attributes these positive outcomes to his economic plan and expects it to continue delivering good jobs. The bipartisan budget agreement, which he looks forward to signing into law, aims to protect the economic recovery and the progress made by American workers in the past two years.
