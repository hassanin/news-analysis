President Biden has announced his intention to nominate 10 individuals as Federal Circuit and District Court judges, as well as one individual as a Superior Court Judge for the District of Columbia. The nominees represent a diverse range of backgrounds and professional experiences, including renowned jurists, public defenders, prosecutors, private sector attorneys, military personnel, and public servants. Among the nominees are three African American women for Circuit Court vacancies, potentially the first Muslim American federal judge in U.S. history, the first AAPI woman to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of D.C., and the first woman of color to serve as a federal judge for the District of Maryland. President Biden's commitment to the federal judiciary is evident in the historically fast pace at which he has moved to fill vacancies, with 11 nominees announced, surpassing any President in modern history. The nominees are highly qualified and reflect the diversity that strengthens the nation.
