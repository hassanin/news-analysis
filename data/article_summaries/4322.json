In honor of Pan American Day and Pan American Week, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reaffirms the strength of the regional community and the democratic principles that unite the Americas. He emphasizes that many of the challenges faced today, such as the COVID-19 crisis, climate change, the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, violence, and corruption, require collective action and cannot be solved by individual nations alone. President Biden believes that a secure, economically prosperous, and democratic hemisphere is in the best interest of the United States and the entire region. He calls for principled and democratic leadership, anchored in the rule of law, to address these challenges. The President highlights the importance of governments being accountable to voters and delivering real benefits, including good-paying jobs, education, security, and equal opportunities for all. He also mentions the 20th anniversary of the Inter-American Democratic Charter and urges governments to renew their commitment to democracy. President Biden proclaims April 14, 2021, as Pan American Day and April 11-17, 2021, as Pan American Week, calling on officials to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
