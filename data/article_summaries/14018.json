President Obama announced $1.5 billion in funding to help families in states that have been heavily affected by the housing bubble. These states have experienced a decline in home prices of over 20% from the peak, and many families are facing challenges that their resources cannot handle. The funding will be used to work with housing finance agencies in these states to address the most pressing problems in their communities. The programs may include assistance for unemployed homeowners, support for borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth, addressing challenges from second mortgages, and promoting sustainable and affordable homeownership. The program will prioritize transparency and accountability, with program designs posted online and effectiveness measured and published. The funding will come from the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. State and local housing finance agencies will determine the priorities for their local markets and submit program designs to receive funding. The programs will address challenges such as unemployed borrowers, underwater borrowers, and second liens.
