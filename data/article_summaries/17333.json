The White House has released a proclamation declaring September as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. The proclamation acknowledges the brave children who battle pediatric cancer and emphasizes the importance of support from families, friends, and communities. While advancements in research have made pediatric cancer more treatable, challenges still remain. Children who survive cancer often face complications later in life, and more research is needed to develop treatments specifically for pediatric cancer. The proclamation also highlights the Affordable Care Act, which ensures that children with pre-existing conditions, including cancer, can receive insurance coverage. Additionally, insurance companies are prohibited from rejecting coverage for children participating in clinical studies, and lifetime dollar limits on health benefits are banned. The National Cancer Institute continues to conduct research on the causes of childhood cancer to improve treatments. The proclamation calls on all Americans to join in the fight against childhood cancer.
