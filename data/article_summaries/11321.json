The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced sanctions against 18 senior Syrian regime officials in response to reports from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and United Nations (UN) Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) that confirmed the regime's use of chlorine as a chemical weapon in 2014 and 2015. This is the first time the United States has imposed sanctions on specific Syrian officials for violating the Chemical Weapons Convention and UN Security Council Resolution 2118. The statement strongly condemns the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons and emphasizes the need to hold them accountable. The United States urges all UN member states and parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention, including Russia, to support efforts to enforce accountability through the UN Security Council and domestic law.
