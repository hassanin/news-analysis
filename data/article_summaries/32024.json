An open letter signed by 137 economists supports the GOP tax reform bill, stating that if it passes, it will lead to economic growth, more jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living for Americans. The letter argues that the current corporate tax rate in the US is the highest in the industrialized world, making the country uncompetitive and causing economic underperformance. The economists believe that a lower corporate tax rate, such as a permanent 20% rate, will ignite the economy with levels of growth not seen in generations. They argue that a competitive corporate rate will drive greater investment, capital stock, business formation, and productivity, resulting in more jobs and higher wages.
