President Biden has announced his intent to appoint several individuals to serve as members on the National Council on Disability (NCD). The NCD is an independent federal agency that advises the President, Congress, and other federal agencies on policies, programs, and practices that affect people with disabilities. The appointees include Hoskie Benally Jr., a member of the Navajo Nation who is legally blind and has experience in disability systems advocacy; Theo W. Braddy, a disability advocate who became paralyzed at the age of 15 and has been involved in various disability-related organizations and initiatives; Claudia L. Gordon, a dedicated advocate for people with disabilities who has held leadership positions in the private and public sectors, including the U.S. Department of Labor and the White House Office of Public Engagement; Risa Jaz Rifkind, a justice advocate who focuses on shifting power and influence for people with disabilities; and Emily Voorde, an associate director with NEWCO Strategies who has a background in education and disability advocacy. These individuals bring a wealth of experience and expertise to the NCD and will contribute to its mission of enhancing equal opportunity for people with disabilities.
