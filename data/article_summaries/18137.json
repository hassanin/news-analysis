President Obama called to congratulate President Karzai on the birth of his daughter and they discussed their shared commitment to the Lisbon framework, which aims to transfer full responsibility for security to Afghan forces by the end of 2014. They also discussed President Karzai's concerns about night raids and house searches, as well as the presence of foreign troops in Afghan villages. The two leaders agreed to further discuss these concerns at the NATO Summit in May.
