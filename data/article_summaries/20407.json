Director Clapper has returned to Washington state with Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller, the two remaining Americans who were in custody in North Korea. The purpose of Clapper's trip was solely to bring the Americans home and not to pursue any other diplomatic opening. Clapper did not meet with Kim Jong Un but did meet with several North Korean security officials. The timing of the release is unclear, but it is seen as a positive step. Clapper's trip lasted approximately a day, and he was chosen as the senior American official due to his background on the Korean Peninsula. Other topics may have been brought up during the trip, but Clapper's main focus was reiterating the importance of North Korea meeting its commitments to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. The trip was authorized by the President, and there were positive signals from North Korea that the visit would result in the release of the two Americans. Clapper carried a letter from the President to Kim Jong Un, stating his purpose of bringing the Americans home. The decision to send Clapper as a government official was made to increase the chances of success in bringing the Americans home. The President approved the plan, and logistical preparations took several days. The condition of Bae and Miller appears to be relatively good, but further information is limited at this time.
