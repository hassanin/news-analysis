President Barack Obama sent a letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate stating that the national emergency with respect to Cuba, which was declared in 1996, will continue beyond February 25, 2017. The letter explains that a mass migration from Cuba would endanger the security of the United States and that the unauthorized entry of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is in violation of U.S. law and contrary to U.S. policy. President Obama determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of vessels.
