President Obama announced his intention to make recess appointments to fill vacant government positions that have been delayed due to Republican obstruction. These appointments include key positions in the economic team and boards that have been vacant for months. The President stated that if Republicans in the Senate refuse to fulfill their responsibility of approving or rejecting his nominees, he must exercise his authority to fill these positions temporarily. The nominees will still require confirmation from the Senate after their appointment. The Obama administration has faced unprecedented levels of obstruction in the Senate, with 217 candidates pending confirmation for an average of 101 days, and 15 candidates pending for an average of 214 days or almost 9 years. In contrast, at the same point in his presidency, President Bush had only 5 nominees pending. President Obama plans to nominate 15 candidates during the recess, including positions such as Deputy Secretary of National Finance, Assistant Secretary of Tax Policy, and Chief Agricultural Negotiator.
