President Trump has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to Lebanon, which was declared in Executive Order 13441 in 2007, will continue beyond August 1, 2020. This decision is based on ongoing activities such as Iran's arms transfers to Hizballah, which pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The President has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency in order to address these concerns.
