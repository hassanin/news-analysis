President Obama has announced the creation of two new marine sanctuaries in Maryland and Lake Michigan in order to protect and preserve the ocean and its marine ecosystems. He has also pledged to tackle illegal fishing. The ocean and marine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by climate change, which is causing sea levels and ocean temperatures to rise. Carbon pollution is also being absorbed by the oceans, causing them to acidify. The rate of acidification is increasing faster than any time in the past 55 million years. The "Our Ocean" conference in Chile aims to address these challenges and promote sustainable fisheries, reduce marine pollution, and stem ocean acidification. The President has previously taken steps to protect marine areas, including designating the Bristol Bay area of Alaska as off-limits to future oil and gas leasing and expanding the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is now moving forward to designate the first new National Marine Sanctuaries since 2000 in Maryland and Lake Michigan. The Administration is also launching Sea Scout, a global initiative to combat illegal fishing, and providing new tools to target illegal fishing, including an application that detects ocean-going vessels using space-based sensors. The Administration has also released a final action plan to combat illegal fishing and seafood fraud, which includes measures to strengthen enforcement and develop a traceability program to track seafood from harvest to entry into U.S. commerce.
