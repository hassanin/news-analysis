The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new findings and actions to protect Americans' drinking water from contamination, particularly from "forever chemicals" like PFAS. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is publishing four new drinking water lifetime health advisories for certain PFAS chemicals. Additionally, $1 billion in grant funding is being made available through President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help communities facing PFAS contamination. This is the first tranche of $5 billion that can be used to reduce PFAS in drinking water. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also provides $10 billion in funding to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants in water. State and local governments are being provided with additional tools to address PFAS pollution and protect drinking water. The White House is coordinating a government-wide approach to address PFAS, including enhanced coordination on military installation issues. The Biden-Harris Administration is prioritizing prevention of contaminated water supplies and advancing research on PFAS science and solutions.
