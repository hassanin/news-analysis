President Obama will deliver remarks at the Los Angeles Trade Technical College, where he will call for economic patriotism and the closing of unfair tax loopholes. The President will highlight the need to close a specific tax loophole that allows companies to avoid paying taxes in the US. The White House supports congressional proposals to address this issue and make the effective date retroactive to May 2014. The President will call on Republicans in Congress to take action, as they did in 2004. The President believes that companies using loopholes to reduce the tax base are renouncing their American citizenship and not contributing to economic growth. The White House is also focused on addressing the border crisis and hopes that Congress will act to provide necessary resources.
