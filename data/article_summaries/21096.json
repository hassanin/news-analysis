President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared in Executive Order 12170 in 1979, will continue beyond November 14, 2014. The President cites the fact that relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal and the process of implementing agreements with Iran from 1981 is still ongoing as reasons for the continuation of the national emergency.
