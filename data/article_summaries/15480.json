Vice President Biden announced that U.S. e-Chromic LLC, a Colorado-based start-up, has signed the first agreement under the Department of Energy's "America's Next Top Energy Innovator" challenge. The company will use electrochromic technology developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to create a new thin film window material that reflects sunlight on demand, making windows more energy efficient and reducing cooling costs for consumers. This agreement demonstrates how American innovation is growing the economy and keeping America competitive in the 21st century. Entrepreneurs interested in obtaining patents and patent applications held by the National Laboratories can now obtain a streamlined option agreement through the challenge, with the opportunity to option groundbreaking technologies for a $1,000 upfront fee. The available technologies include biomass, vehicle technology, and grid energy storage.
