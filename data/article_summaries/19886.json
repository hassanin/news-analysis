Deputy National Security Advisor Benjamin Rhodes met with Iraqi Chaldean and Assyrian community leaders to discuss the security situation in Iraq and its impact on Christian and other minority groups. Rhodes condemned the ongoing attacks by ISIL on these communities and the destruction of religious sites. He emphasized the importance of Iraq forming an inclusive government that addresses the concerns of all communities, including Christians, in order to effectively confront the security and humanitarian challenges posed by ISIL. Rhodes also called on government officials in Baghdad and Erbil to assist Iraq's vulnerable populations and stressed the need for continued international attention to this issue. The United States remains committed to helping all of Iraq's diverse communities, including Christians, Sabean-Mandaeans, Shabak, and Yezidis.
