The White House Office of Trade & Manufacturing Policy (OTMP) has released a report stating that China's policies pose a threat to the economic and national security of the United States. The report focuses on China's Made in China 2025 plan, which aims to capture high-technology industries that will drive future economic growth. These industries include artificial intelligence, aerospace, augmented and virtual reality, high-speed rail, shipping, and new energy vehicles. The report highlights China's aggressive efforts to acquire American technology and intellectual property through various means, such as physical and cyber theft, forced technology transfers, evading US export controls, export restraints on raw materials, and investments in over 600 high-technology assets in the US worth nearly $20 billion.
