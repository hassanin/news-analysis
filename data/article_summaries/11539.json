President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for Pennsylvania due to the effects of Tropical Storm Lee. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to individuals and businesses in the affected counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and other recovery programs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Thomas J. McCool as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the area. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated in the future. Residents and business owners can apply for assistance online or by phone.
