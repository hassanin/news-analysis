President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring September 11, 2016, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. This day is dedicated to remembering the nearly 3,000 lives lost in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and honoring the individuals who made sacrifices for the country in the years following the attacks. The proclamation calls on all Americans to engage in acts of service and charity to pay tribute to the victims and to visit www.Serve.gov to find opportunities to give back to their communities. The President also encourages the display of the U.S. flag at half-staff and asks for the observance of a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, the time when the first plane struck the World Trade Center.
