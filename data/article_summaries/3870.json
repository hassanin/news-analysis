On March 29, 2023, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13664 regarding the situation in South Sudan will continue for another year. The national emergency was initially declared on April 3, 2014, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by activities in South Sudan. These activities include violence, atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment and use of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations. The President determined that the situation in South Sudan still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, necessitating the continuation of the national emergency. The notice of this decision will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
