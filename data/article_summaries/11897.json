The article discusses the Strategic Partnership Agreement between the United States and Afghanistan. The agreement was negotiated for 20 months and aims to provide a long-term framework for the relationship between the two countries after the drawdown of U.S. forces. It focuses on building an enduring partnership that strengthens Afghan sovereignty, stability, and prosperity while also defeating al Qaeda and contributing to regional security. The agreement does not commit the United States to any specific troop levels or funding, but allows for a continued presence of U.S. forces in Afghanistan after 2014 for the purposes of training Afghan security forces and targeting al Qaeda. The article also mentions that reconciliation efforts with the Taliban have been put on hold due to internal political turbulence within the Taliban. The article concludes by stating that the agreement does not seek permanent military bases in Afghanistan and that the U.S. is committed to reducing troop numbers and transitioning to a support role as the Afghans take over security responsibilities.
