Participants also called for expanding AI education to more students and increasing the number of teachers with the necessary knowledge and skills. The event also highlighted partnerships between government, labor, private sector, and educators to advance inclusive AI education. Several organizations also announced commitments to support AI education in American classrooms during Computer Science Education Week.
