The United States government is emphasizing its commitment to global health and research cooperation. In the fight against COVID-19, the government is investing in public health, science partnerships, health systems, and global health security. The President's Budget for FY 2023 includes over $17 billion for the Department of State and USAID, as well as over $11 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services. This funding will support various areas such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, maternal and child health, family planning, nutrition, and pandemic preparedness. The government believes that these investments not only protect Americans but also promote economic progress and the development of capable partners. The Biden-Harris Administration has been actively leading in global health, and this budget continues to prioritize these efforts.
