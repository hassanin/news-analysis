The Prime Minister of Canada and the President of the United States have issued a joint statement on the softwood lumber industry. They acknowledge the importance of this industry to both countries and have instructed their trade representatives to explore options and report back on how to address the issue. The discussions have been challenging but productive, and both governments are working together to find a solution that benefits both Canadian and American softwood lumber producers. They aim to achieve a new agreement that reflects the realities of Canadian timber management policies and the US domestic market, provides a predictable business environment, and supports the overall economic well-being of both countries. The key features they are focusing on include maintaining Canadian exports at or below an agreed US market share, provisions for exclusions if justified, regional policies to eliminate trade frictions, transparency in information collection and exchange, institutional arrangements to administer the agreement, effective enforcement tools, commitments regarding the use of trade remedies, flexibility to adapt to market situations, and addressing other issues such as product scope and joint market development. While progress has been made, there are still significant differences to be resolved. The governments will continue their dialogue and aim to achieve a mutually-acceptable agreement by the fall.
