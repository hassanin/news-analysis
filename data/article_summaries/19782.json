Vice President Biden released a statement expressing his support for the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which was recently passed by the Senate with bipartisan support. He urged the House to renew the law without delay in order to continue helping victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Biden emphasized the urgency of the situation, highlighting the statistics of women being killed by their partners and the high number of women who have experienced abuse. He called on the House to follow the Senate's lead and pass the VAWA, stating that it is not a partisan issue but a matter of justice and compassion.
