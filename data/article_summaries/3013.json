This article discusses an executive order signed by President Joe Biden to establish the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics. The order emphasizes the importance of the success of Hispanic and Latino students in achieving the nation's future prosperity and global leadership. It acknowledges the positive impact of the Hispanic community in various fields and recognizes the barriers and inequities faced by Hispanic and Latino students in accessing quality education. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequities, particularly in remote learning and employment opportunities. The order aims to address these challenges by focusing on policy goals such as increasing access to early childhood education, addressing disparities in disciplinary actions, improving data collection and implementation of evidence-based strategies, ensuring access to qualified teachers and school leaders, enhancing student support services, promoting a positive school climate, addressing racial and socioeconomic segregation, ensuring equitable access to resources and technology, and breaking down barriers in higher education institutions. The order also establishes a Federal Interagency Working Group and a Presidential Advisory Commission to provide advice and coordination in advancing educational equity and economic opportunity for Hispanics.
