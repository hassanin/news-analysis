The action aims to protect American jobs and American workers by addressing harmful import surges. The President also directed Ambassador Lighthizer to continue supporting industry discussions to resolve duties on these and similar products in the United States and China. The goal is to create jobs in the United States and ensure fair trade. President Trump also mentioned ongoing negotiations for new trade deals, including NAFTA and the deal with South Korea.
