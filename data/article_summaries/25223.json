On July 27, Vice President Mike Pence visited the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine to mark the start of phase three clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial, conducted by the company Moderna, will involve 89 sites across the country and over 30,000 participants. Pence emphasized that the development of a vaccine is moving at an unprecedented pace but assured the public that safety would not be compromised. He also expressed confidence that a vaccine would be available by late this year or early next year. Pence and other officials highlighted the importance of reopening schools, citing the low risk of the virus to healthy children and the negative impacts of distance learning on education and social development. Pence stated that the government is committed to providing resources to states to safely bring students back to the classroom.
