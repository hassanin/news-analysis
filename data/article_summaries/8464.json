President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694, which addresses significant malicious cyber-enabled activities, will continue beyond April 1, 2023. The President believes that these activities, originating from outside the United States, still pose a significant threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency declaration.
