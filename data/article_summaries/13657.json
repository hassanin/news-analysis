This article is an executive order issued by President Barack Obama on December 7, 2012. The order reestablishes the Advisory Group on Prevention, Health Promotion, and Integrative and Public Health. This group was originally set up under Executive Order 13544 in June 2010 and continued by Executive Order 13591 in November 2011. The Advisory Group is tasked with advising the President on matters related to prevention, health promotion, and integrative and public health. The order states that the Advisory Group will continue until September 30, 2013, unless extended by the President. The same members who were serving on the Advisory Group on September 30, 2012, are reappointed to the group. The order also clarifies that it does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments, agencies, or their heads, nor does it create any right or benefit that can be legally enforced against the United States or any other party.
