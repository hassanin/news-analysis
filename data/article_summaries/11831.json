The article is a fact sheet on the Leaders' Summit on Refugees that took place in September 2016. The summit aimed to address the mass displacement crisis caused by the largest refugee crisis since World War II. The results of the summit included commitments from 52 countries and international organizations to increase financial contributions to UN appeals and humanitarian organizations by $4.5 billion compared to 2015 levels. These commitments also doubled the number of refugees resettled or provided other legal channels of admission in 2016, improved access to education for one million refugee children globally, and improved access to lawful work for one million refugees globally. Additionally, several countries committed to significantly increasing their financial contributions for humanitarian assistance, and 18 countries pledged to start or expand UNHCR-facilitated third-country resettlement programs. The summit also introduced two platforms: the Global Crisis Response Platform, which provides financing to low- and middle-income countries hosting large refugee populations, and the Emergency Resettlement Country Joint Support Mechanism, which offers financial and technical assistance to countries interested in establishing or expanding refugee resettlement programs. The United States, as part of its contributions to the refugee crisis, has resettled over 3.2 million refugees since 1975, increased the number of refugees resettled annually, and provided billions of dollars in humanitarian assistance.
