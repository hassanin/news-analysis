Vice President Mike Pence has provided policy recommendations to President Trump to streamline the regulatory environment for commercial space companies. At the second National Space Council Meeting, four recommendations were agreed upon to reform the commercial space regulatory frameworks at the Departments of Transportation and Commerce. The recommendations include transforming the launch and re-entry licensing regime, consolidating space commerce responsibilities in the Office of the Secretary of Commerce, coordinating with the Federal Communications Commission to protect radio frequency spectrum necessary for commercial space activities, and initiating a policy review of current export licensing regulations affecting commercial space activity.
