President Donald J. Trump has been nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in brokering the Abraham Accords, which led to the full normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. This is seen as a significant step towards peace in the Middle East, with widespread international support and optimism for the region's future. The nomination recognizes President Trump's bold diplomacy and vision, and he will be hosting a signing ceremony for the Abraham Accords at the White House on September 15.
