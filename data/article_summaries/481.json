Yesterday, Jennifer Klein, Director of the White House Gender Policy Council, and Rohini Kosoglu, Domestic Policy Advisor to the Vice President, held a meeting with reproductive justice leaders to discuss access to reproductive health care. The leaders shared concerns about the challenges patients face due to extreme laws that restrict access to critical health care. They also highlighted the disproportionate impact these restrictions have on underserved communities, including communities of color and low-income women. Vice President Kamala Harris also met with doctors and nurses to discuss the potential impact of overturning Roe v. Wade on women's health care. Additionally, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre issued a statement on an extreme bill in Oklahoma that aims to undo reproductive rights.
