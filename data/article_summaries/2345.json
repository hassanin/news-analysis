Yesterday, members of the Biden-Harris Administration, including Heather Boushey and Zach Liscow, attended the Inaugural Meeting of the Roundtable on Macroeconomic and Climate-related Risks and Opportunities. The goal of this roundtable is to improve understanding of how climate change impacts the economy and explore the implications for fiscal, monetary, and financial policies. The United States is implementing an ambitious agenda to address climate change, and the President has set a goal of transitioning to clean energy by 2050. The Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and Budget have established an Interagency Technical Working Group to develop new analytic tools for modeling the economic effects of climate change. The launch of the National Academies' Roundtable will contribute to these efforts by providing insights and informing the working group. The roundtable will address issues such as translating the impacts of climate change into macroeconomic analyses and adapting models to accommodate climate risks and opportunities.
