The federal government and a coalition of 24 companies and foundations have formed the Economic Opportunity Coalition (EOC) to align investments in underserved communities. The founding members of the Coalition include Bank of America, Google, PayPal, and The Rockefeller Foundation, among others. The Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments through the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address economic disparities and provide economic growth opportunities for historically underserved communities. Vice President Kamala Harris will announce efforts to catalyze and align public and private investments to accelerate economic opportunity in communities of color. The EOC will coordinate across sectors to develop products that solve challenges in resource distribution and drive meaningful action. Additionally, six federal government agencies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to better align federal dollars flowing into underserved communities, facilitating collaboration between public and private sectors to address economic disparities. These efforts include investing in community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and minority depository institutions (MDIs), supporting entrepreneurship and minority-owned businesses, and making infrastructure investments.
