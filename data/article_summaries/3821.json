On World AIDS Day, President Joe Biden reaffirms the commitment to ending the HIV epidemic globally and in the United States. Despite significant progress in preventing, detecting, and treating HIV, not everyone has equal access to care, particularly marginalized communities. President Biden has taken several actions to address this, including increasing funding for HIV prevention and treatment, advocating for the repeal or reform of HIV criminalization laws, and removing employment barriers for HIV-positive individuals in the Armed Forces. The President also highlights the importance of international efforts, such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. While there are challenges ahead, President Biden expresses hope for an AIDS-free future where everyone receives the care and respect they deserve. The President proclaims December 1, 2022, as World AIDS Day, urging individuals and governments to remember those lost to AIDS and provide support to people living with HIV.
