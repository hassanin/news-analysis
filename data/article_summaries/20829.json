The article is a proclamation by President Barack Obama declaring July 28, 2013, as World Hepatitis Day. The proclamation raises awareness about viral hepatitis, which affects one in twelve people worldwide and causes liver cancer and cirrhosis. It emphasizes the importance of prevention and treatment, as many infected individuals are unaware they have the disease. Vaccines for hepatitis A and B are recommended for all children and high-risk adults, while early detection and treatment can reduce transmission and complications of hepatitis C. The article mentions that viral hepatitis disproportionately affects certain communities, such as African American, Hispanic, and Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, as well as individuals born between 1945 and 1965. The Obama Administration is working to raise awareness and implement programs to prevent new infections, promote testing and treatment, and reduce the number of new hepatitis cases. The Affordable Care Act also requires health insurance plans to cover hepatitis A and B vaccines, screenings for hepatitis B in pregnant women, and screenings for hepatitis C in high-risk individuals. The proclamation calls for breaking the silence around viral hepatitis and encourages individuals to learn the risk factors, talk to at-risk individuals, and seek strategies for staying healthy.
