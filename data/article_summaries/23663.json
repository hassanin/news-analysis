President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the Santa Clara Pueblo, ordering federal aid to supplement the Tribe's efforts in the area affected by severe storms and flooding. The declaration allows for federal funding to be available for emergency work on a cost-sharing basis. Nancy M. Casper has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the Tribe and warranted by further damage assessments. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
