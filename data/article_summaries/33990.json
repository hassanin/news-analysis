On December 18, 2020, the President signed four bills into law. The first is the "National Sea Grant College Program Amendments Act of 2020" (S. 910), which reauthorizes the National Sea Grant College Program until fiscal year 2025. It also clarifies that the program includes financial assistance for research, training, and technology transfer, and modifies the Dean John A. Knauss Marine Policy Fellowship Program.

The second bill is the "Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act" (S. 945), which requires certain securities issuers to prove that they are not owned or controlled by a foreign government. This is especially important if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board cannot audit specific reports due to the issuer using a foreign public accounting firm that is not subject to inspection by the Board.

The third bill is the "Digital Coast Act" (S. 1069), which mandates the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to maintain a program capable of integrating coastal data with decision-support tools, training, and best practices. The goal is to improve the management of coastal regions at the local, state, and federal levels.

The fourth bill is the "Save Our Seas 2.0 Act" (S. 1982), which establishes a nongovernmental Marine Debris Foundation and a prize competition called the "Genius Prize for Save Our Seas Innovation." The act aims to increase efforts to raise international awareness of plastic waste and combat marine debris by engaging and coordinating with other governmental and nongovernmental entities. It also creates infrastructure grant programs to be administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.
