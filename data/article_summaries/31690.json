The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its monthly Employment Situation Report, which shows that the U.S. unemployment rate is now the lowest it has been in nearly 50 years. The rate dropped to 3.7 percent, the lowest since December 1969. This decrease in unemployment is attributed to more people finding jobs, as the labor force participation rate remained unchanged. Additionally, unemployment rates for Hispanics, women, and those with a high school degree and no college attendance also reached historic lows. The BLS survey of employers showed that nonfarm payroll employment rose by 134,000 jobs in September. While below expectations, employment gains in August were revised upwards, showing a healthy number of 270,000 jobs gained that month. Since President Trump took office, the U.S. economy has created 4.2 million jobs. Job growth has been strong across various industries, with goods-producing industries adding almost 900,000 jobs. Nominal average hourly and weekly earnings have also seen growth, with 2.8 percent and 3.4 percent respectively over the past 12 months. Overall, the surveys released by BLS offer more evidence of a booming U.S. economy and a strong labor market.
