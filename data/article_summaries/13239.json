The White House is hosting the White House Supply Chain Innovation Roundtable, a gathering of over 20 manufacturers and suppliers committed to strengthening small manufacturers in their domestic supply chains. Major manufacturers such as Boeing, Medtronic, Volvo Trucks, Siemens, Rolls Royce, and Lockheed Martin are investing in the smaller firms that power their U.S. supply chains. These companies are helping transition technologies from their labs out into the U.S. supply chain through supplier training, loaning engineering talent, collaborative procurement policies, and advance guidance on new technologies and practices. The Departments of Energy, Defense, Commerce, and the Small Business Administration are also helping small manufacturers leverage federal innovation assets to upgrade their capabilities, adopt new technologies, and unlock new business opportunities. The Department of Energy will provide $20 million in new innovation vouchers to small businesses to access technologies and capabilities at five of its National Labs. The White House, working with mayors and governors, will expand regional efforts to link businesses with federal, state, and local innovation assets. The Department of Defense is awarding supply chain grants to strengthen and diversify regional supply chains in several states. The Small Business Administration is launching a new supply chain matching service to help small manufacturers access new business opportunities. The Department of Commerce's Manufacturing Extension Partnership is scaling up its Supply Chain Optimization Service to strengthen supply chains across all 50 states. The President's strategy is to invest in the strength of small manufacturing firms and ensure they have access to cutting-edge technologies to improve the competitiveness of the U.S. supply chain.
