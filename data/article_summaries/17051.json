The White House and U.S. Department of Education are launching this year's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) three months earlier than usual. This will allow more students to access financial aid and better information when they need it. The FAFSA will also be streamlined, allowing students and families to automatically populate the form with last year's tax information, making the process easier and more accurate. The College Scorecard, which provides information on college costs, graduation rates, debt, and post-college earnings, will also be integrated with the FAFSA to help students make more informed decisions about their college options. The Obama Administration has doubled investments in financial aid, including increasing the maximum Pell Grant and establishing the American Opportunity Tax Credit. The federal government provides nearly $180 billion in financial aid, and organizations like Google, College Board, and the Common Application are incorporating the College Scorecard data into their products to provide students and families with better information. The Department of Education is also providing resources and support to help students complete the FAFSA and navigate the financial aid process. Additionally, over 170 organizations have committed to sharing information about the FAFSA and the College Scorecard, reaching an additional 20 million students.
