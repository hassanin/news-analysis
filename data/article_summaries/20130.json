Due to drought conditions, the wildfire season in the West has started earlier and is expected to last longer than usual. The President expressed his commitment to working closely with the governors and funding wildfire suppression in a more responsible and effective way. They discussed the outlook for the drought and the current fire season, as well as long-term wildfire trends. The meeting also highlighted efforts to provide the best-available science for preparedness and response, modernize wildland firefighting resources, and build resilience to fires by restoring landscapes and forests. The Federal Government will continue to partner with state and local governments, and the President looks forward to engaging with the governors on climate change impacts. Various governors and administration officials participated in the meeting.
