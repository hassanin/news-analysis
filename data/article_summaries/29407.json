The core objective of President Trump's Iran Strategy is to bring about systemic change in Iran's actions, including blocking all paths to a nuclear weapon and exporting terrorism. The strategy involves applying maximum pressure on Iran's economy through sanctions and other measures. The impact of re-imposing sanctions on Iran has shown that predictions of the U.S. being weakened and isolated were false, as Iran has found itself increasingly alone without the expected foreign investment. Iran's malign behavior in the region poses a direct threat to U.S. economic and strategic interests and risks triggering a wider conflict. The U.S. aims to increase the cost of Iran's destructive policies and force Iran back to the negotiating table. The U.S. is also working to roll back Iran's activities within its borders and in the region by encouraging warmer ties between Iraq and Gulf countries, aligning Israel with Arab countries, and disrupting Iran's illicit procurement networks. The U.S. also urges the Iranian people to envision a different future and encourages Iran's leadership to choose a path to a brighter future for the Iranian people.
