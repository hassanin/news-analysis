President Biden is hosting the second Tribal Nations Summit to strengthen relationships with Tribal Nations and provide Tribal leaders with direct access to senior Administration officials. The President has prioritized relationships built on respect for Tribal sovereignty, honoring federal trust and treaty responsibilities, protecting Tribal homelands, and conducting regular consultation. The Administration has also allocated historic levels of funding for Tribal communities, including $32 billion in the American Rescue Plan, $13 billion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and $700 million in the Inflation Reduction Act. At the Summit, new actions will be announced to further these efforts, including the establishment of Tribal Advisory Committees in various federal agencies, the creation of new positions to address Native American affairs, new regulations to protect Tribal rights and lands, and initiatives to promote economic development, clean energy transition, and education in Tribal communities.
