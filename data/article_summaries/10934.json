President Obama will sign the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2012, which extends the Bank's authority through 2014 and increases its portfolio cap to $140 billion. The goal of this bipartisan bill is to help U.S. businesses sell their products and services around the world and ensure a level playing field for U.S. businesses. The President believes that promoting U.S. exports is crucial for domestic economic growth and job creation. The National Export Initiative, launched in 2010, aims to double U.S. exports over five years and support two million new export-related jobs. The Export-Import Bank has played a significant role in this progress, setting export finance records and supporting small businesses. Despite challenges in the global economy, U.S. exports have reached a record-breaking level, supporting millions of jobs. The legislation includes provisions such as extending the Bank's authority, increasing its portfolio limit, focusing its mission, enhancing transparency, updating technology, and reviewing existing policies. The Bank will continue to work towards minimizing trade-distorting financing of exports from global competitors while providing support to U.S. exporters. The Administration has been working tirelessly to support U.S. exporters, counseling thousands of companies and resolving trade issues.
