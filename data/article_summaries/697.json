On June 30, 2023, the President signed a new law called the "Changing Age-Determined Eligibility To Student Incentive Payments Act" or the "CADETS Act." This law changes the age requirement for the Student Incentive Payment Program, which is administered by the Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration. The law acknowledges and thanks Senator Gary Peters, Representative Jack Bergman, Senator Todd Young, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Tammy Baldwin, Senator Ted Cruz, and Senator Mike Braun for their leadership in making this change.
