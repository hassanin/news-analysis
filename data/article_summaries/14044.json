This article is a presidential memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on December 7, 2012. The memorandum is titled "Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 1245 (d) (4) (B) and (C) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012." 

In the memorandum, President Obama states that, after considering various factors such as global economic conditions, increased oil production by certain countries, spare capacity, and the availability of strategic reserves, he has determined that there is enough supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. This determination allows for a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions. President Obama also mentions that he will monitor the situation closely to ensure that the market can accommodate this reduction. 

The memorandum concludes by authorizing and directing the Secretary of State to publish it in the Federal Register.
