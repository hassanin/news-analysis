On the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, the President reaffirms the United States' commitment to a world without torture or other cruel treatment. The President issued an Executive Order on his second day in office to ban torture and has worked to match words with actions. Torture not only goes against our values and obligations, but also emboldens repressive regimes and serves as a pretext for terrorism. The United States stands in solidarity with victims of torture and thanks those who work towards the goals of the Convention Against Torture.
