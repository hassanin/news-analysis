During a trip to El Paso, Texas, President Biden will assess enforcement operations at the Bridge of the Americas Port of Entry, which recently received $600 million in funding to improve trade, security, and processing. He will also visit a federally funded migrant services center, where he will meet with local officials, faith leaders, and NGOs who support migrants fleeing political oppression and economic collapse. The President will hear from local business leaders about the economic impact of immigrants in the region and address workforce shortages. He will be joined by federal, state, and local officials, as well as community leaders throughout the day. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas discussed the surge of resources in response to the challenges in El Paso, including the opening of a new soft-sided facility that can process up to 1,000 migrants a day. Mayorkas also emphasized the importance of working with local officials and organizations to provide humanitarian relief. During a press briefing, Mayorkas addressed questions about asylum procedures and the proposed rule that migrants must ask for asylum in the country where they first arrive. He explained that the goal is to incentivize migrants to use ports of entry instead of relying on smuggling organizations. Mayorkas also discussed the labor shortage in the United States and the need for comprehensive immigration reform. The press briefing touched on various topics, including the President's call with Speaker McCarthy, the debt limit, and the upcoming North American Leaders Summit in Mexico City.
