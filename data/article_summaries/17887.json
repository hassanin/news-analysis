President Obama and his wife, Michelle, expressed their sadness at the passing of Harold Ramis, a renowned satirist and comedy genius. Ramis, who was born and raised in Chicago, was known for his work in movies such as "Animal House," "Caddyshack," "Ghostbusters," and "Groundhog Day." The President highlighted how Ramis' films not only made people laugh, but also challenged authority, resonated with outsiders, and celebrated underdogs. President Obama extended his condolences to Ramis' family and all those who loved him, and expressed hope that Ramis had achieved "total consciousness."
