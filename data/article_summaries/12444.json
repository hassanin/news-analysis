President Barack Obama has announced that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13667 with respect to the Central African Republic will continue beyond May 12, 2015. The situation in the country, characterized by a breakdown of law and order, sectarian tension, widespread violence and atrocities, and the forced recruitment of child soldiers, poses a threat to the peace, security, and stability of both the Central African Republic and neighboring states. President Obama has therefore determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
