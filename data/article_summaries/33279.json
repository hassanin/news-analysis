On March 13, 2017, the President issued an executive order to begin the process of reorganizing federal departments and agencies. The aim is to make these entities more efficient, eliminate duplication and redundancy, and reduce wasteful spending. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will oversee the evaluation of each department and agency, seeking input from both experts and the American people. Based on this input, a detailed plan will be developed to improve the functioning of the federal government. The President expressed confidence in his Cabinet's ability to carry out this reorganization and thanked them for their efforts. The plan will then be implemented with the help of Congress.
