On March 8, 2015, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13692, declaring a national emergency with respect to Venezuela. This was due to concerns about the erosion of human rights guarantees, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, use of violence and human rights violations in response to antigovernment protests, arbitrary arrest and detention of protestors, and significant government corruption in Venezuela. The situation described in the executive order has not improved, so President Obama has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
