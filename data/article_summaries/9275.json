The elected officials highlighted how these investments will benefit their communities and praised the flexibility of the American Rescue Plan in funding supportive services. They also discussed challenges in sustaining funding for these services and the importance of creating opportunities for students. The Administration committed to supporting these counties through workforce resources and ongoing dialogue. This session was the second in a series, with previous meetings involving African American mayors and local elected leaders and staff from several states.
