President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran will continue beyond November 14, 2010. This national emergency was declared in Executive Order 12170 on November 14, 1979. The President cites the fact that relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal and the process of implementing agreements with Iran is still ongoing as reasons for the continuation of the national emergency.
