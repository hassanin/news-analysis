The Trump administration has unveiled a new Africa Strategy aimed at advancing US interests on the continent. The strategy focuses on three core priorities: advancing US trade and commercial ties with Africa, countering the threat from radical Islamic terrorism and violent conflict, and ensuring that US aid is used efficiently and effectively. The strategy acknowledges the growing influence of China and Russia in Africa and aims to counter their predatory practices. The US will target its funding towards key countries and strategic objectives, and will encourage African nations to choose high-quality and transparent foreign investment projects. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of regional security cooperation and will reevaluate support for UN peacekeeping missions. Additionally, the US will review its assistance to South Sudan and develop a new foreign assistance strategy to improve the effectiveness of American foreign aid worldwide.
