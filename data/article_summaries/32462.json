President Donald J. Trump has signed an executive order to review the designations made under the Antiquities Act by the previous administration. The Antiquities Act allowed the federal government to place millions of acres of land and water under federal control, taking away the decision-making power from the states and the people who live in them. This executive order aims to give that power back to the states and the people. President Trump has also taken steps to eliminate regulations that are seen as wasteful and job-destroying for various industries.
