The CEO of Small Business Majority, John Arensmeyer, has expressed support for President Obama's American Jobs Act. Arensmeyer applauds the president's focus on small businesses, including cutting taxes for them and closing corporate tax loopholes. He believes that putting middle-class Americans back to work and boosting their spending power is crucial for small businesses. Arensmeyer emphasizes that small businesses create 65% of all new jobs and that spotlighting them will benefit the economy. However, he also urges lawmakers to develop programs that provide small businesses with cash flow, support small business innovation, and help them get credit and hire workers. Arensmeyer argues that these policies will not only reduce unemployment but also government spending and boost revenue. He calls on Congress to act quickly and put aside partisan bickering to prioritize small businesses and the public good.
