In honor of National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, Melania and Donald Trump express their condolences for the 14,000 American women who will lose their lives to ovarian cancer this year and the 20,000 who will be diagnosed with the disease. They urge all Americans to be aware of the symptoms and risk factors associated with ovarian cancer, especially women who are middle-aged or older, have had cancer before, or have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Early detection is key in combatting the disease, and they encourage women to consult their healthcare providers about their risk. The Trump administration is committed to supporting researchers and medical professionals in their efforts to treat and defeat ovarian cancer. They highlight the approval of an additional therapy by the FDA and the signing of the "Right to Try" legislation, which provides expanded treatment options for those with terminal illnesses. The administration promises to continue finding new ways to fight ovarian cancer and stands with those who are battling the disease.
