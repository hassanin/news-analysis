The National Security Council Senior Director for Europe, Amanda Sloat, provided an update on the NATO Summit during a teleconference. She highlighted the positive outcomes of the first day of the summit, including the welcoming of Finland as the newest member of NATO and the commitment of Allies to increase defense spending. Sloat also mentioned the adoption of a Defense Production Action Plan to strengthen the defense industrial base and the update of NATO's counterterrorism guidelines and cyber defense pledge. She announced that a substantial new aid package will be sent to Ukraine and emphasized the long-term commitment of the United States and G7 leaders to support Ukraine's military and security. Sloat mentioned that Ukraine still needs to make further democratic and security sector reforms to join NATO, and the progress will be reviewed annually through the Annual National Programme. The teleconference was cut short due to a call to load the motorcade.
