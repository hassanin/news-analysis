In this statement, Press Secretary Jay Carney discusses the President's proposal to address the fiscal cliff. The President's proposal aims for a balanced approach that includes significant deficit reduction and compromises on both revenue and spending. The President is willing to continue working with Republicans to achieve a bipartisan solution that protects the middle class, helps the economy, and ensures fiscal sustainability. However, the President is not willing to accept a deal that doesn't ask enough of the wealthiest in taxes and instead shifts the burden to the middle class and seniors. Carney criticizes the Speaker's "Plan B" approach, stating that it won't pass the Senate and fails to protect middle class families. The President remains hopeful that both sides can find common ground and reach a solution.
