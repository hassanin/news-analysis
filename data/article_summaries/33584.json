President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations, which was declared in Executive Order 13581 in 2011, will continue beyond July 24, 2018. The President argues that these organizations pose a significant threat to international political and economic systems, as they are becoming more sophisticated and entrenched in foreign governments and the international financial system. The President believes that these organizations weaken democratic institutions, undermine economic markets, and facilitate violent conflicts. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declaration.
