President Trump has announced more results from his Administration's efforts to reduce regulations, which are estimated to save U.S. consumers and businesses over $220 billion per year. The deregulation program is projected to boost household incomes by upwards of $3,100 annually in the future. The benefits will include access to cheaper cars and savings on prescription drugs. These rollbacks on everyday items will particularly benefit blue-collar and middle-class Americans. Overregulation disproportionately affects lower-income families who spend a larger share of their incomes on heavily regulated goods and services. President Trump has kept his promise to roll back regulations, with nearly eight regulations being rolled back for each new one implemented under his administration. This has already saved about $50 billion in regulatory costs, and cutting red tape is projected to lead to a $53 billion per year increase in real incomes for Americans between 2021 and 2029. The goal is to have a government that operates efficiently, effectively, and inexpensively while protecting citizens and creating jobs.
