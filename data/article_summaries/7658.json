The White House has released state-by-state fact sheets outlining how the Build Back Better Framework will benefit working families across the United States. The framework includes investments in climate, care, and children, which will reduce the costs of essential items, support employment, and promote economic growth. It aims to help the country achieve its climate goals, generate millions of well-paying jobs, increase labor force participation, and strengthen the economy from the bottom up. Additionally, the framework intends to create a fairer tax system by ensuring that corporations and the wealthiest individuals contribute their share, providing relief for middle-class families. The fact sheets cover each state and territory, as well as specific constituencies such as Black communities, Latino communities, AANHPI communities, Native American communities, LGBTQI+ communities, and rural communities.
