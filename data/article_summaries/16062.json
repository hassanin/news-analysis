President Obama will be announcing new steps to enhance collaboration with Alaska Natives, the State of Alaska, and local communities. One of the key announcements is the renaming of Mt. McKinley to Denali, which recognizes the sacred status of the mountain to Alaska Natives. The President will also discuss ways to strengthen cooperation between the Federal Government and Alaska Native tribes in developing cooperative management strategies for fish and wildlife. Climate change is a significant concern for Alaska Natives, as the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. Rising temperatures are impacting the range of sea ice, causing coastal erosion, affecting marine life, and increasing the frequency of wildfires. President Obama has been committed to engaging and collaborating with Native American tribes throughout his time in office, hosting tribal conferences and visiting Indian Country. The article also highlights other initiatives, such as funding for tribal fish commissions, neighborhood revitalization in Anchorage, a youth engagement program to promote the Arctic way of life, and a collaboration to bridge the gap between native communities, conservation science, and natural resource management.
