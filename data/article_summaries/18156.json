President Obama announced in a conference call with health care navigators and volunteers that over 6 million Americans have signed up for private health insurance plans through the federal and state Marketplaces since October 1. The President thanked the group for their hard work and urged them to continue their efforts in the last four days of open enrollment. He encouraged the navigators and volunteers to leave no stone unturned in helping as many Americans as possible sign up for affordable health coverage by the March 31 deadline. There are over 27,000 trained assistors across all fifty states who are helping consumers sign up in their communities.
