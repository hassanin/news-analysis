This article is a Presidential Memorandum from May 24, 2011, discussing the Federal Government's responsibility to reduce oil imports and promote the use of alternative fueled vehicles. The memorandum directs executive departments and agencies to ensure that new light duty vehicles leased or purchased by the government are alternative fueled vehicles, such as hybrid or electric, compressed natural gas, or biofuel. It also requires agencies to disclose any executive fleet vehicles that are larger than a midsize sedan or do not comply with alternative fueled vehicle requirements. The Department of Energy is tasked with assisting the United States Postal Service in evaluating alternative fuel technologies for their fleet. Additionally, the General Services Administration is directed to develop a Vehicle Allocation Methodology (VAM) to determine the optimal inventory of vehicles for each agency, with an emphasis on eliminating unnecessary vehicles and ensuring cost-effectiveness. Agencies are required to determine their optimal fleet inventory and submit fleet management plans to the Administrator of General Services. The Administrator will then provide recommendations for acquiring alternative fueled vehicles. The memorandum also addresses the applicability of these requirements to law enforcement and emergency vehicles and provides definitions for terms used in the document. It concludes with general provisions, stating that the memorandum should be implemented in accordance with applicable law and does not create any legal rights or benefits.
