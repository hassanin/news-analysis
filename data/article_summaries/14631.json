President Obama will deliver remarks on July 18th at the White House, discussing how the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is holding insurance companies accountable and returning money to Americans. The ACA requires insurance companies to spend at least 80% of premium dollars on medical care and quality improvement. If they fail to meet this requirement, they must provide rebates to their customers. As a result, over 8.5 million consumers will receive half a billion dollars in rebates this summer, averaging around $100 per family. The ACA has also helped consumers save approximately $3.9 billion on premiums in 2012.
