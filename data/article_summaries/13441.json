The White House has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Somalia. This emergency was originally declared in 2010 due to the deteriorating security situation, acts of piracy, and violations of the arms embargo in Somalia. In 2012, additional measures were taken to address the export of charcoal, misappropriation of public assets, and acts of violence against civilians. The national emergency will continue for another year, as the situation in Somalia still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
