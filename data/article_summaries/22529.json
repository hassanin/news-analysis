This article is a presidential memorandum from October 4, 2011, regarding the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008. The memorandum states that the Government of Chad has taken steps to comply with the standards outlined in the act and has implemented policies to prevent the use of child soldiers. The memorandum also waives the application of the act's prohibition with respect to Yemen and partially waives it with respect to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This allows for the continued provision of military education and training, non-lethal defense articles, and licenses for commercial sales of military equipment. The memorandum directs the Secretary of State to submit this determination to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register. It is signed by President Barack Obama.
