President Trump has signed an executive order establishing the One Trillion Trees Interagency Council as part of the United States' commitment to the World Economic Forum's One Trillion Trees Initiative. The goal of this initiative is to protect and restore one trillion trees globally by 2030. The executive order promotes the active management of forests and rangelands through partnerships with various stakeholders. It also creates the Council to coordinate the federal government's involvement in the initiative and address any limitations that may hinder participation. Managing and conserving forests is important for the environment and the economy, as they provide clean water, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities. The Trump Administration has already taken significant actions to enhance conservation efforts, such as passing legislation for public lands and investing in national parks. The Department of the Interior has also planted millions of trees under President Trump's leadership. This latest announcement reinforces the administration's commitment to protecting and regenerating trees as a vital asset.
