President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed May 21, 2021, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 16 through May 22, 2021, as National Transportation Week. In his proclamation, President Biden recognizes the important role that transportation infrastructure has played in supporting economic growth and national security throughout the history of the United States. He highlights the transformative impact of transportation systems, from merchant ships during the Revolutionary War to the interstate highway system. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has further demonstrated the vital nature of the transportation system, as it enabled the distribution of vaccines and played a crucial role in the pandemic response. However, President Biden also acknowledges the shortcomings of the current transportation system, including its negative impact on vulnerable communities, unequal access to services, local pollution, and contribution to climate change. 

To address these issues, President Biden has proposed the American Jobs Plan, which aims to modernize highways, roads, and bridges, improve access to transportation options, reduce congestion, and create jobs. The plan also focuses on building a resilient transportation system that can withstand natural disasters and provides equitable access to opportunity for all Americans. It includes provisions for replacing buses and rail cars, building new rail corridors and transit lines, and reducing commerce bottlenecks at ports and airports.

President Biden expresses gratitude to the dedicated transportation workers who have kept the nation moving during the pandemic, including truckers, airline crews, military members, and other transportation workers. He calls on all Americans to observe National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to show appreciation for those who build and operate the nation's transportation systems.
