Ambassador Cindy McCain has been appointed as the next Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). With her extensive humanitarian and business experience, McCain will provide strong leadership to one of the largest humanitarian organizations globally. This appointment is crucial as the world faces unprecedented levels of acute food insecurity due to conflicts and climate change, which endanger the lives and livelihoods of millions. The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized addressing global food insecurity, and as the leading donor to WFP, they anticipate close collaboration with Ambassador McCain and the WFP personnel she will lead. Outgoing Executive Director David Beasley's significant contributions in mobilizing international attention and resources to provide life-saving support to the most vulnerable are also acknowledged.
