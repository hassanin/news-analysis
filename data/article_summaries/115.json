The Deputy Assistant to the President and Coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, Kurt Campbell, provided an update on the United States' approach to China's provocative behavior towards Taiwan. He stated that China has overreacted and its actions have been provocative, destabilizing, and unprecedented. China launched missiles into the waters around Taiwan, declared exclusion zones, disrupted civilian traffic, crossed the centerline between China and Taiwan, surrounded Taiwan with warships, and imposed sanctions on Speaker Pelosi and her family. In response, the United States demonstrated its commitment to peace and stability by supporting Taiwan and its partners, reinforcing alliances, and maintaining a presence in the region. The United States will continue to take steps to uphold peace and stability, including conducting transits through the Taiwan Strait, fulfilling its commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act, deepening ties with Taiwan, and adjusting its presence and exercises in response to China's behavior. The United States also called on China to reopen channels of communication and criticized China for cutting off talks and suspending climate talks. The United States reaffirmed its One China policy and opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo, while seeking peaceful resolution of cross-Strait differences. The international community has expressed interest in preserving peace and stability, and the United States will do its part to preserve it. The call ended with a brief Q&A session.
