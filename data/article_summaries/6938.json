President Biden will visit a Philadelphia-area elementary school to highlight how the American Rescue Plan is providing resources to keep schools safe and open, combat learning loss, and address student mental health. The visit will showcase how American Rescue Plan funds are being used to hire more school staff, provide tutoring, and offer afterschool programs. The President will also speak with students to hear about the issues they are facing. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, the President's nominee for the Supreme Court, has received endorsements from a wide range of individuals, including law enforcement officials and conservative judges. Next week, President Biden will sign a bipartisan funding bill, address the National League of Cities Congressional City Conference, participate in an event to celebrate Women's History Month, and possibly commemorate St. Patrick's Day. On the topic of Russia and Ukraine, President Biden has warned that there will be severe consequences if Russia uses chemical weapons. The White House believes that Russia's actions in Ukraine, including targeting civilians, may constitute war crimes. The U.S. is revoking Russia's most-favored-nation status and imposing tariffs and other restrictions on Russian imports. The U.S. is also working with European allies to address Russia's attempts to tie the Iran nuclear deal to unrelated issues like Ukraine. The goal of the sanctions is to provide off-ramps for Russia, but ultimately, it is up to President Putin to decide whether to take them. The longer the conflict continues, the more Russia's economy suffers. President Biden accused Republicans of playing games with oil prices, but independent fact-checkers have deemed these accusations disingenuous, attributing rising gas prices to the pandemic and international supply pressures.
