This article is a Presidential Trade Proclamation issued by President Barack Obama on December 29, 2011. The proclamation modifies the duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and makes other changes related to trade with Israel. It states that certain articles determined to be import-sensitive are not eligible for benefits under the GSP. The proclamation also mentions agreements between the United States and Israel regarding trade in agricultural products, including the extension of the 2004 Agreement through December 31, 2012. The President determines that duty-free access into the United States for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel is necessary to maintain reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions provided for by the United States-Israel Free Trade Area (USIFTA). The proclamation also includes technical corrections to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) to provide the intended tariff treatment for certain products. The modifications to the HTS are effective on specific dates mentioned in the proclamation.
