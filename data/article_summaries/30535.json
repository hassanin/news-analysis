President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding a determination on the supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. The memorandum states that after considering various factors such as global economic conditions, increased oil production by certain countries, spare petroleum production capacity, and the availability of strategic reserves, President Trump determines that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. As a result, there can be a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions. The Secretary of State is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register, and President Trump will continue to monitor the situation closely.
