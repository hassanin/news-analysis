The article discusses Executive Order 13493, issued by President Barack Obama on January 22, 2009. The order establishes a Special Task Force on Detainee Disposition, which is responsible for identifying lawful options for the detention, trial, transfer, release, or other disposition of individuals captured or apprehended in connection with armed conflicts and counterterrorism operations. The task force consists of various high-ranking government officials, including the Attorney General, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of National Intelligence, among others. The Co-Chairs of the task force have the authority to designate officers and employees to support the task force's work. The mission of the task force is to conduct a comprehensive review of the available options and identify those that are consistent with national security, foreign policy interests, and the interests of justice. The Department of Justice provides administrative support and funding for the task force. The task force is required to submit a report to the President within 180 days of the order's issuance, with periodic preliminary reports during that period. The task force will be terminated upon the completion of its duties. The order is implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
