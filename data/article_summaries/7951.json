The White House Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization has released an initial report with recommendations to support energy communities, particularly those affected by coal, oil, gas, and power plant closures. The report identifies nearly $38 billion in existing federal funding that can be accessed for infrastructure, job creation, and community revitalization efforts. It also highlights geographic areas that are priorities for investment. The Department of Energy has announced $109.5 million in funding for projects that will create jobs in energy communities. Brian Anderson has been named the Executive Director of the Interagency Working Group. President Biden's American Jobs Plan will provide a historic investment in energy community revitalization, including infrastructure projects, pollution mitigation, and the development of next-generation industries. The plan also aims to increase access to affordable housing, deliver high-speed broadband, and support clean energy manufacturing. Additionally, the plan includes funding for environmental remediation, job creation, and the strengthening of manufacturing supply chains. The report emphasizes the importance of empowering workers and ensuring fair labor standards and union rights.
