The Supreme Court has ordered to keep the current Title 42 policy in place while reviewing the matter in 2023. The authorities will comply with this order and prepare for the Court's review. Meanwhile, they are also preparing for the eventual lifting of Title 42 and making efforts to manage the border in a secure, orderly, and humane manner. They are also working on expanding legal pathways for immigration. The statement emphasizes that Title 42 is a public health measure, not an immigration enforcement measure, and should not be extended indefinitely. The article suggests that comprehensive immigration reform measures proposed by President Biden need to be passed by Congress to address the challenges at the border. The order provides an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats in Congress to work together and pass the reform measures and provide additional funds for border security.
