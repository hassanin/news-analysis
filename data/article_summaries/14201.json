President Obama has launched the TechHire initiative, a campaign to train Americans for well-paying technology jobs. The President announced this initiative during a speech to the National League of Cities, emphasizing the importance of empowering every American with the education and training necessary to earn higher wages. The TechHire initiative aims to provide pathways to technology jobs through various means, including universities, community colleges, coding bootcamps, and online courses. Over 20 communities across the United States are committing to expanding access to tech jobs and working with employers to recruit and train applicants based on their skills. The initiative also includes a $100 million grant competition by the Department of Labor to support innovative approaches to training and employing low-skill individuals with barriers to training and employment. Private sector leaders are also pledging resources to support innovation in technology training and to reach underserved populations. The TechHire initiative is part of the President's broader agenda to invest in job-driven training and create pathways to the middle class.
