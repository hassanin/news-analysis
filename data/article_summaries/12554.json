President Obama announced over $240 million in new commitments to support STEM education at the 2015 White House Science Fair. The commitments include $150 million to support early-career scientists, $90 million to expand STEM opportunities for underrepresented youth, $25 million for a Department of Education competition to create science and literacy themed media, and commitments from 120 universities and colleges to train 20,000 engineers. Additionally, a CEO coalition called Change the Equation committed to expanding effective STEM programs to an additional 1.5 million students this year. The fair also highlighted the achievements of students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM and featured projects ranging from basic research to new inventions. The President emphasized the importance of STEM education for the nation's economic future and recognized the need for diversity in the STEM fields. The new commitments build on the President's "Educate to Innovate" campaign, which has resulted in over $1 billion in support for STEM programs.
