President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in Mali, which was declared in Executive Order 13882 on July 26, 2019, is to continue beyond July 26, 2023. The situation in Mali, including ceasefire violations, expansion of terrorist activities, drug trafficking, human rights abuses, hostage-taking, coup d'etat, presence of foreign mercenaries, and intensified attacks against civilians, defense and security forces, United Nations missions, and international security presences, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
