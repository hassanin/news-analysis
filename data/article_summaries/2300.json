Micron Technology Inc. is planning to invest billions of dollars in Upstate New York to build the largest semiconductor manufacturing facility in the U.S. This investment is expected to create tens of thousands of well-paying jobs. The decision to invest in New York was influenced by the CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law by President Biden in August, which provides incentives for semiconductor manufacturing. Micron's CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, credited the CHIPS Act for making the investment possible. This announcement follows similar investments by Wolfspeed and Intel in North Carolina and Ohio, respectively. The investment has been hailed as a significant boost to American manufacturing and job creation, with President Biden calling it "another win for America." The project has received bipartisan support and is seen as a major step towards reducing America's dependence on foreign chips.
