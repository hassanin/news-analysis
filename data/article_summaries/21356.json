The article is a press briefing by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney on President Obama's response to the Supreme Court ruling on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Carney states that the President made two phone calls after the ruling, one to Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the United States v. Windsor case, and one to Chad Griffin, President of the Human Rights Campaign and the plaintiffs and legal team involved in the Proposition 8 case.
