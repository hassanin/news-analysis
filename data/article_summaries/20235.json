President Obama has declared a major disaster in Virginia due to a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in December 2009. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement the recovery efforts in the affected area. The funding will be available to the Commonwealth, eligible local governments, and certain nonprofit organizations for emergency work, facility repairs or replacements, and snow assistance. Hazard mitigation measures for the entire Commonwealth will also receive federal funding. Donald L. Keldsen has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Additional designations may be made later based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA.
