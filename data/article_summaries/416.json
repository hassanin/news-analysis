In this article, the author discusses the importance of firefighters and the efforts being made to improve their pay and support. The writer mentions that firefighters are considered some of the bravest individuals who protect communities from disasters. It is noted that previously, federal firefighters were paid $13 per hour, but this changed during the current administration. Last summer, their pay was increased to $15 per hour as a first step towards improving their compensation. The author also highlights the efforts made to secure investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which aim to provide federal firefighters with better pay, respect, and dignity. The article goes on to announce additional steps being taken to increase firefighter pay, expand mental health support, and create more career pathways in wildland firefighting. These measures, already funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will temporarily increase firefighter's pay by up to 50% of their annual base salary for two years. However, the article acknowledges that more needs to be done, especially considering the increasing frequency of wildfires due to climate change. The author pledges to work with Congress to secure long-term funding to ensure firefighters receive the pay and dignity they deserve.
