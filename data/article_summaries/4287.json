President Biden held a press conference in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to discuss the progress made in implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. He emphasized the importance of fixing problems and uniting the country through infrastructure investments that benefit all Americans. The President highlighted several accomplishments, including the release of billions of dollars to states for highway modernization, grants for port improvements, funding for airport upgrades, and the launch of a program to expand high-speed internet access. He also addressed issues related to clean water, lead pipe replacement, hazardous waste site cleanup, and the capping of orphaned oil and gas wells. The President emphasized the importance of investing in renewable energy, particularly wind energy, to achieve his goal of carbon-pollution-free electricity by 2035. He also discussed efforts to strengthen the energy grid and announced a significant investment in bridge improvements, including funding for economically significant bridges and smaller bridges that are often overlooked. The President stressed that these investments are just the beginning and that they will create jobs, improve communities, and position the United States as a global leader in infrastructure. He thanked those in attendance for their support and emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in how the funds are spent.
