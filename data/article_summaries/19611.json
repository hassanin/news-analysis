On June 17, 2013, the White House Office of the Press Secretary released a notice to Congress regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans. This national emergency was initially declared on June 26, 2001, by President George W. Bush through Executive Order 13219. The declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat posed by extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia and the Western Balkans region, as well as acts obstructing the implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 relating to Kosovo. President Bush later amended the order in 2003 to include acts obstructing the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement in Macedonia. The notice states that the actions of individuals threatening peace and international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2001 must continue beyond June 26, 2013. As per the National Emergencies Act, President Barack Obama, at the time, is continuing the national emergency for another year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
