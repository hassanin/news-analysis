President Obama released a statement expressing his support for the confirmation of Todd Jones as the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). He commended Jones for his experience and described his confirmation as both welcome and overdue. The President criticized Senate Republicans for refusing to confirm an ATF director for nearly seven years due to political reasons, rather than qualifications. He praised a bipartisan group of senators for breaking through the gridlock and giving Jones the vote he deserved. While the confirmation will help ATF in its law enforcement mission, the President emphasized the need for common-sense reforms to prevent dangerous weapons from reaching criminals and to protect communities. He pledged to continue advocating for such reforms and to prioritize the safety of children and communities.
