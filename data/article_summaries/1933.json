The United States and Canada have reaffirmed their commitment to working closely together in the interests of collective security and prosperity. They have a roadmap, called the Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership, which guides their work. The roadmap aims to build a greener and more prosperous future, grow their economies, combat the global COVID-19 pandemic, create safer and more equitable communities, and stand together against threats to democracy. Defending democracy is a core part of their commitment to stand with Ukraine against Russia's invasion. They have made progress in deepening their cooperation on climate change, supporting the global pandemic response, enhancing Arctic cooperation, and building future economies. However, there is still much work to be done. Both countries are stronger when they work together towards their shared objectives, and they look forward to continuing their enduring partnership in the future.
