The Biden-Harris Administration is set to announce new measures to protect patient privacy at the Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access meeting. These actions come in response to recent Supreme Court decisions and efforts by states to penalize healthcare providers and interfere in personal medical decisions. The Cabinet will discuss ongoing efforts to defend reproductive rights and improve access to reproductive healthcare. The Administration will also provide updates on their response to Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA and implementation of the Presidential Memorandum on safe access to medication abortion. Additionally, the Administration will focus on providing accurate information and strengthening data related to women's health. These actions build upon previous steps taken by the Administration to safeguard patient privacy and ensure access to accurate information.
