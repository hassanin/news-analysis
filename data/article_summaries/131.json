President Biden announced the designation of Avi Kwa Ame and Castner Range as national monuments, protecting these areas of cultural, ecological, and historical significance. The designation of Avi Kwa Ame National Monument in southern Nevada will preserve hundreds of thousands of acres of land that is considered sacred by 10 Yuman-speaking tribes. Castner Range National Monument in El Paso, Texas, will protect a culturally historic and environmentally sensitive area that has been the focus of conservation efforts for over 50 years. These designations are part of President Biden's commitment to conserving 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. Leaders from tribal nations, conservation organizations, and elected officials have praised the announcements for their contributions to land and water conservation, cultural preservation, and climate action.
