On October 4, 2022, the President signed two laws into effect. The first law, H.R. 5577, designates a United States Postal Service facility in Atlanta, Georgia, as the John R. Lewis Post Office Building. The second law, H.R. 6899, is known as the "Russia and Belarus SDR Exchange Prohibition Act of 2022." This law prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from engaging in transactions involving the exchange of Special Drawing Rights held by Russia or Belarus. The President expressed gratitude to Representative Nikema Williams, Senators Warnock and Ossoff, the Georgia delegation, and others for their leadership in passing the first law. Similarly, the President thanked Representative Hill, Senators Rick Scott and Manchin, and others for their leadership in passing the second law.
