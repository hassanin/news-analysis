The article discusses the High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program in the Northeast region of the United States. The program aims to invest in projects that will improve speeds, reduce trip times, and strengthen the passenger rail network as an alternative to air and car travel. The region has seven intercity passenger rail corridors, including the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor from Washington, D.C. to New York to Boston. Other corridors include Philadelphia to Harrisburg, New York to Albany to Buffalo, New York to Montreal, Boston to Portland to Brunswick, Albany to Rutland, and New Haven to Springfield to Burlington to St. Albans. The article mentions the specific improvements and investments planned for each corridor, such as new tunnels, bridges, track work, and station upgrades. The grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act will be used to improve safety, reliability, and travel times in these corridors.
