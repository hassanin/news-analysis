In this press gaggle, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz discusses President Obama's upcoming trip to Birmingham, Alabama where he will emphasize the contrast between his vision for middle-class economics and the efforts of Republicans in Congress to roll back progress. Schultz highlights the administration's consumer protection efforts, such as cracking down on backdoor payments and hidden fees and helping student borrowers afford loan payments. He also mentions Microsoft's new policy requiring contractors and vendors to provide employees with paid sick days and vacation time. Schultz is asked about the charges against Bowe Bergdahl and the exchange for the Taliban five, to which he emphasizes the commitment to not leave any American soldier behind and states that the circumstances surrounding the case are ongoing and therefore he cannot comment further. He is also asked about the Germanwings flight crash and whether any agencies will review safety procedures, to which he refers to French authorities and later the FAA for information. Schultz is questioned about the situation in Yemen and the US involvement, stating that Saudi Arabia and GCC members are taking military action to defend Saudi Arabia's border and protect Yemen's legitimate government, and that the US is providing logistical and intelligence support. He is also asked about coordination with Saudi Arabia and the impact on conversations with Iran over the nuclear deal, to which he responds that the international community is united in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and that conversations are ongoing. Lastly, Schultz is asked about Hillary Clinton's failure to disclose all donations to her foundation, to which he states he hasn't seen the reports and refers to the State Department for details on implementation.
