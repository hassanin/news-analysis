The Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity has requested that states provide publicly available voter data, as allowed by their state laws. Currently, 20 states have agreed to provide the requested information, while 16 states are reviewing which information can be released. Contrary to news reports, only 14 states and the District of Columbia have refused to provide the information. The commission will continue its work to gather facts and ensure the integrity of each American's vote.
