The Biden-Harris Administration has announced over $700 million in private sector investments to increase the production of electric vehicle (EV) chargers in the United States. This will result in the manufacturing of more than 250,000 new EV chargers annually and the creation of over 2,000 jobs. The investments aim to make EV charging more affordable, accessible, and equitable. This follows the $7.5 billion allocated from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build a national network of EV chargers for convenient and uniform charging at home, work, and across the country. The President's leadership and vision have positioned the United States as a leader in the electric future and have united automakers and autoworkers towards the goal of having 50% of new vehicles sold in 2030 be electric. Additionally, the President's actions include activating the federal government's purchasing power to procure more zero-emission vehicles by 2027 and 100% zero-emission vehicles by 2035. These investments not only boost domestic manufacturing capacity but also create thousands of high-quality, union jobs in building, installing, and maintaining the charging infrastructure.
