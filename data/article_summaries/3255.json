President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed April 30 through May 6, 2023, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. The proclamation raises awareness about the hazards of hurricanes and provides resources to help Americans stay safe and protect their property. It acknowledges the devastating damage caused by hurricanes, particularly in Florida and Puerto Rico, and emphasizes the increasing impact of climate change on storm surges, flooding, and heavy rainfall. President Biden highlights the importance of the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which allocates over $50 billion to strengthen infrastructure against flooding and climate disasters. The Inflation Reduction Act further combats climate change with significant investments in green manufacturing, clean energy, and climate-smart agriculture. The act aims to reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and supports weather forecasting improvements and resilience projects in coastal communities. The proclamation encourages individuals to plan, prepare, and protect their families, including updating insurance policies, organizing important documents, knowing evacuation routes, and having emergency kits ready. It also acknowledges the courage, kindness, and resilience of first responders, community organizations, workers, scientists, and families in the face of natural disasters. President Biden calls on all Americans to contribute to building a climate resilient nation and urges government agencies to share information to protect lives and property.
