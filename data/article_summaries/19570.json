Vice President Joe Biden has issued a call to action to boost college graduation rates across the country and help the United States meet President Obama's goal of having the best-educated workforce and the highest proportion of college graduates by 2020. Biden called on each Governor to host a state college completion summit and released a college completion tool kit for states and Governors to draw ideas from. He also announced a new grant competition focused on helping institutions of higher education boost completion rates. The United States will need to increase the number of college graduates by 50 percent to meet the President's goal. The Administration is releasing a calculation of each state's share of the goal and a comprehensive college completion tool kit to help governors develop college completion plans. The toolkit includes suggested policies, strategies, and existing federal resource streams. The Department of Education is accepting applications for the 2011 Comprehensive Grant Program, which will provide $20 million to colleges to implement plans that can increase success and improve productivity. The Administration has also proposed two programs in its 2012 budget to support college completion efforts. These include the First in the World initiative and College Completion Incentive Grants. The Obama-Biden Administration has taken other steps to increase access to and affordability of higher education, such as boosting Pell grant funding, increasing tax incentives, simplifying the application process, and implementing a program that forgives student debt for public service.
