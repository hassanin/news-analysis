This article is a transcript of a teleconference previewing the Vice President's trip to Munich. The call is on background and the contents are embargoed. The speakers, referred to as "senior administration officials," provide updates on the situation in Russia and Ukraine. They state that Russia's claim of withdrawing troops from the Ukrainian border was false and that Russia has actually increased its troop presence. The officials also express concerns that Russia may launch a false pretext to justify an invasion of Ukraine and emphasize the need for diplomacy while being prepared for a potential attack. 

The article then discusses the Vice President's agenda in Munich, which includes discussions on unity with European allies, economic measures, U.S. and NATO force posture, support for Ukraine, and the diplomatic path to de-escalation. The Vice President will engage with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, leaders of the Baltic states, and congressional members attending the conference. On the second day, the Vice President will deliver a speech addressing the situation on Ukraine's border and the threat of Russian aggression. She will highlight the unity among transatlantic allies, reassure commitments to NATO, and emphasize the broader stakes of Russia's actions. The Vice President will also meet with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and Chancellor Scholz of Germany.

In response to a question about the contingencies if Russia invades Ukraine during the Vice President's visit, the officials state that the situation is fluid and ongoing consultations with allies are crucial to ensure a strong and resolute response.
