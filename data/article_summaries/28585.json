First Lady Melania Trump hosted the launch of the Building the Movement Exhibit: America’s Youth Celebrate 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage. The exhibit honors the centennial anniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment, which gave American women the right to vote. The exhibit showcases artwork from a competition for students in grades 3-12, depicting individuals, objects, and events significant to the women's suffrage movement. The First Lady thanked attendees for celebrating the anniversary and praised the young artists for their impressive artwork. She emphasized the importance of engaging children in conversations about equality and encouraged them to continue expressing themselves through art and learning about the history of the movement. The exhibit is presented by the Office of the White House Curator in partnership with the Office of the First Lady and the Women’s Suffrage Centennial Commission.
