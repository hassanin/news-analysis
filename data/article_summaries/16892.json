President Obama convened a National Security Council meeting to discuss the intensification of the campaign against ISIL. He was briefed on the progress made by Iraqi security forces in taking back Ramadi, as well as efforts to accelerate and integrate the military campaign in Iraq and Syria. The President directed his national security team to intensify efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL by increasing military cooperation with partners, disrupting foreign fighter networks, halting ISIL expansion outside of Syria and Iraq, countering financing, disrupting external plotting efforts, and countering propaganda and messaging. The President emphasized the need for coordination and cooperation among global partners, with the United States leading the efforts of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL.
