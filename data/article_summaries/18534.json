The article discusses the background and details of the Iran sanctions. The US has been building a comprehensive sanctions regime to pressure Iran to meet its international obligations regarding its nuclear program. Today marks two important milestones in this effort. First, any foreign financial institution that conducts significant transactions with the central bank of Iran for the sale or purchase of petroleum or petroleum products is subject to US sanctions. Second, China and Singapore have significantly reduced their volume of crude oil purchases from Iran and are exempted from the sanctions for the next 180 days. These actions further demonstrate the success of the sanctions policy and the international coalition that is pressuring Iran. The sanctions are having a significant impact on Iran's economy, with a 20-30% reduction in sales and a decrease in crude oil exports. The US will continue to implement these sanctions and work with other oil producers to encourage increased production and development. The goal is to force Iran to come in line with its international obligations or face increased isolation and pressure. The article also mentions the upcoming P5-plus-1 meeting in Istanbul and the importance of China's actions in reducing imports from Iran. The US has been working closely with Turkey and other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil. The process of granting exceptions to countries involves evaluating their steps to reduce imports and assessing the global supply and demand of energy markets. So far, 20 countries have received exceptions. The US has been cooperating with Russia in implementing the sanctions and maintaining P5-plus-1 unity in pressuring Iran. The article concludes by noting that the EU oil embargo on Iran will go into full effect on July 1st and that negotiations with Iran will continue on July 3rd.
