Officials and business leaders are highlighting the importance of adopting the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to boost the economy and support the manufacturing and agricultural industries. They argue that the USMCA will benefit various states and industries, including Illinois farmers, California agriculture, Iowa's agriculture industry, and the job market in Orange County. The USMCA is also seen as crucial for preserving California's trade history and helping black-owned businesses prosper. Additionally, Michigan's economy heavily relies on tariff-free trade with Canada and Mexico, and without the USMCA, Michigan companies could face significant additional taxes.
