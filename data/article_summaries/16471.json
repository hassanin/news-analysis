President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring June 2013 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Pride Month. In the proclamation, Obama acknowledges the progress that has been made in the fight for LGBT equality, such as the affirmation of marriage equality in multiple states and the extension of protections for transgender Americans. The Obama Administration has also implemented various policies to support LGBT rights, including extending hate crimes protections and repealing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." However, Obama acknowledges that there is still work to be done, and he expresses support for further initiatives such as the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and the Respect for Marriage Act. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to eliminate prejudice and celebrate the diversity of the American people.
