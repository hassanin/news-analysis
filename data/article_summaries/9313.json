President Biden signed an executive order aimed at expanding access to affordable, high-quality care and providing support for care workers and family caregivers. The order includes more than 50 directives for government agencies and is the most comprehensive set of executive actions taken by any president to make care more affordable and accessible for families. The order aims to invest in care as an investment in the future of America's families, workforce, and economy. Congressional leaders, family caregivers, people with disabilities, long-term care workers, early educators, veterans, and advocates for older Americans have responded positively to the executive order, praising the focus on making care more affordable and improving job quality for care workers. Organizations such as AARP, SEIU, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and the American Federation of Teachers have also expressed support for the order.
