Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a true public servant and advocate for women's rights, has passed away. She led an inspiring life and paved the way for women in the law. As an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, she championed women's rights and reshaped our nation. She will be remembered as a respected jurist who commanded the respect of her colleagues. The writer, Karen, and I offer our prayers and condolences to her family, friends, and admirers.
