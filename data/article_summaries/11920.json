The White House has announced new initiatives to improve college opportunity for all Americans. The President and First Lady will host a Summit on College Opportunity on December 4, 2014, focusing on building collaborations in communities to encourage college enrollment and improve college completion rates. The Administration has also made progress in building partnerships to support college success, including commitments from community colleges to strengthen college readiness for academically underprepared students. The Department of Education is launching a new Center for the Analysis of Postsecondary Readiness to support college readiness efforts, and Khan Academy is developing technology-based solutions to improve student success in developmental math. The Great Lakes Higher Education Guaranty Corporation is partnering with MDRC, the Ohio Board of Regents, and City University of New York (CUNY) to replicate CUNY's successful Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) in Ohio. The White House is also continuing to make progress on previous commitments to expand access to college, including efforts to improve college advising and support school counselors, boost student achievement in STEM fields, and increase FAFSA completion rates.
