On August 7, 2015, the President signed into law H.R. 1138, the "Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act." This act designates three new wilderness areas in Idaho, totaling about 275,665 acres, as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Additionally, it releases four wilderness study areas for multiple-use activities and allows for several land conveyances in Idaho.
