President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to North Korea will continue beyond June 26, 2019. The notice highlights the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, as well as the destabilizing actions and policies of the North Korean government. The President deems it necessary to continue the national emergency due to the threat it poses to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
