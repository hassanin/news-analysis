The Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, along with the FDA, have taken action to increase the production and availability of infant formula following a recall and shutdown of a major production facility. They have worked with manufacturers to boost production, resulting in more formula being produced in April than before the recall. The FDA has reached an agreement with Abbott, the manufacturer whose product was recalled, allowing them to restart production safely. They have also expedited the process for other manufacturers to sell infant formula in the US. To bridge the gap until increased production is achieved, the importation of baby formula is being considered. President Biden has requested that all necessary measures be taken to import safe infant formula quickly, including utilizing contracted aircraft from the Department of Defense. The aim is to ensure swift access to formula for American families.
