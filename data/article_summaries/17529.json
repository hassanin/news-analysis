President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 1, 2011, as Law Day, U.S.A. This annual observance is dedicated to celebrating the principles of government under law and the protection of freedoms that it provides. This year, the proclamation pays tribute to John Adams, one of America's Founders and the second President of the United States. It highlights Adams' commitment to fairness and the rights of the accused, exemplified by his defense of British soldiers charged with firing into a crowd during the Boston Massacre. The proclamation encourages all Americans to reflect on Adams' example and the importance of the rule of law, ensuring that future generations will uphold these ideals. The proclamation also calls for appropriate ceremonies and activities to acknowledge the significance of the nation's legal and judicial systems and the display of the United States flag in support of this observance.
