The Presidential Task Force on Protecting Native American Children in the Indian Health Service System (Task Force) held its second meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico from May 6 to 8, 2019. During the meeting, the Task Force visited the Navajo Nation Dzilth-Na-O-Dith-Hle Health Center and met with health officials and tribal leaders to discuss concerns about the Indian Health Service (IHS). These concerns included the culture, protocols, and practices of the IHS, its ability to recruit and retain quality healthcare professionals, and employee familiarity with mandatory reporting requirements for child abuse. The Task Force also met with Dzilth-Na-O-Dith-Hle Tribal School officials and Navajo officials to discuss child abuse reporting protocols and the recruitment of Native American doctors and medical professionals. They also met with the United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico and tribal leaders to discuss institutional challenges within the IHS system that impact the safety of Native American children. The Task Force will convene again in Montana in the future. Those who wish to provide information or commentary to Task Force members can contact the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. It is important to note that the Task Force's focus is separate from other investigations into the IHS and will not interfere with ongoing criminal investigations, reviews by the Department of Health and Human Services, or a review conducted by an independent contractor retained by the IHS.
