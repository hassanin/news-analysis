President Joseph R. Biden has issued an executive order to strengthen engagement and collaboration between the United States and the African Diaspora. The order recognizes the African Diaspora as a source of strength and highlights the contributions of African Americans and African immigrants to the United States. The order establishes the President's Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement, consisting of representatives from diverse backgrounds, to advise the President on strengthening connections between the US government and the African Diaspora. The Council will address topics such as advancing equity, supporting the United Nations' Permanent Forum on People of African Descent, strengthening cultural and economic ties, expanding educational exchange programs, and promoting collaboration for the socioeconomic well-being of African Diaspora communities. The Department of State will provide funding and administrative support for the Council, which will meet on a quarterly basis. The order is intended to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to available appropriations.
