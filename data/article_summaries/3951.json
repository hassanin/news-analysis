On March 13, 2023, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States announced an agreement for Australia to acquire a conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability through the AUKUS enhanced security partnership. This plan aims to enhance deterrence and promote stability in the Indo-Pacific region. The future submarine, called SSN-AUKUS, will incorporate the best submarine technology from all three nations and will be built and deployed by Australia and the UK. The phased approach outlined in the agreement ensures the highest standards for nuclear non-proliferation and includes responsible stewardship of nuclear propulsion technology and strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The partnership will also result in benefits to infrastructure and industrial capacity in all three nations. The integration of submarine forces and the sharing of submarine technology will further enhance the capabilities of the AUKUS partners. The plan aims to contribute to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.
