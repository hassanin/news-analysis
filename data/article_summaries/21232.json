The Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, Christina Romer, released a statement on the December employment report. She noted that although there was a decline in payroll employment by 85,000, it was less severe than the job losses in September and October. The trend of moderating job loss continued, with the average monthly job loss decreasing over the past few quarters. Revised data showed a small employment increase of 4,000 in November, the first in 23 months. However, December's job loss was seen as a slight setback compared to November. The construction and wholesale/retail trade industries saw significant declines in employment, but there was growth in temporary help services. The unemployment rate remained at 10.0 percent, which Romer considered unacceptably high and emphasized the need for actions to stimulate private-sector job creation. Romer cautioned that monthly employment and unemployment numbers are volatile and subject to revision, so it's important not to overinterpret any one report. The focus should be on continuing efforts to move in the right direction and replace job losses with substantial job gains.
