On December 19, 2019, the President signed into law the FUTURE Act, also known as H.R. 5363. This act provides permanent funding of $255 million for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other minority-serving institutions (MSIs). It also allows for the disclosure of tax return information to administer Federal student financial aid programs and increases funding for the Federal Pell Grant program.
