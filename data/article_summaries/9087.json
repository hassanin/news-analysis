At the 2023 G7 Summit in Hiroshima, Japan, G7 leaders expressed their commitment to expanding the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), an infrastructure initiative led by President Biden. The goal of PGII is to mobilize billions of dollars in infrastructure financing in low- and middle-income countries, focusing on energy, physical, digital, health, and climate-resilient infrastructure. The leaders, along with officials from various countries and private sector executives, discussed methods to increase infrastructure investment, particularly by leveraging private capital. The United States announced new PGII projects, including the development of economic corridors, clean energy solutions, and digital access in Costa Rica. Notable investments also include the expansion of a container port in Ecuador and investments by private sector stakeholders such as Global Infrastructure Partners and Citi. The aim is to drive quality infrastructure investments in developing countries and support the transition to a globally connected and sustainable economy.
