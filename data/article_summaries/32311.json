A new Department of Labor release shows that 3.2 million individuals filed initial unemployment insurance (UI) claims during the week ending on May 2, bringing the total to 33.5 million UI claims over the past 7 weeks. This represents 20.3 percent of the 165 million employed and self-employed workers reported in February 2020. The upcoming Bureau of Labor Statistics' April Employment Situation report is expected to show a significant rise in unemployment, with estimates suggesting that the U-3 unemployment rate could increase from 4.4 percent to 19.8 percent. However, the U-3 unemployment rate may not be the most informative measure of the labor market's health due to individuals who have lost their jobs but are not actively looking for work. Job losses provide a clearer picture of the economic impact of COVID-19, with the leisure and hospitality industry being hit the hardest, followed by construction, education and health services, and professional and business services. Private-sector firms and academics have attempted to capture labor market data more quickly, with estimates indicating a significant decrease in private sector employment in April. As states begin to reopen their economies, there may be early signs of economic recovery in the May report, but fuller measures of recovery will likely not be seen until the June report.
