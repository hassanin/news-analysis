The Trump Administration has three immigration policy objectives: ensuring safe and lawful admissions, defending the safety and security of the country, and protecting American workers and taxpayers. These objectives include building a southern border wall, closing legal loopholes that enable illegal immigration, enforcing immigration laws, returning visa overstays, and establishing a merit-based immigration system that promotes financial success and protects American workers.
