The article discusses the issue of sanctuary cities, which are jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. These cities reject immigration "detainer" requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which are requests to hold an illegal alien in custody for a short time so that ICE can take custody for removal purposes. The article argues that sanctuary city policies endanger both communities and law enforcement by releasing dangerous criminal aliens into society. It states that these policies prevent federal authorities from locating and arresting such individuals, allowing them to continue to harm communities. Furthermore, when sanctuary city officials refuse to honor ICE detainer requests, they put the public and law enforcement officers at risk. The article also mentions that when officials warn illegal aliens about upcoming immigration enforcement activities, it allows criminals to prepare themselves, putting innocent bystanders and law enforcement at greater risk.
