The White House Council on Women and Girls has released a report titled "Women and Girls of Color: Addressing Challenges and Expanding Opportunity." The report highlights the Administration's efforts to reduce barriers for women and girls of color, such as fighting for an increase in the minimum wage and encouraging women to enter STEM fields. The report acknowledges the progress made by women and girls of color in areas like education and economic security, but also addresses the challenges and disparities that still exist. These challenges include lower performance on standardized tests, higher rates of poverty and lower wages, higher rates of heart disease and domestic violence, and biases that perpetuate oppressive standards. The report emphasizes the need to address the intersection of race and gender when addressing these challenges. The White House Council on Women and Girls is convening a Working Group to focus on issues affecting women and girls of color, including education, economic security, health, criminal and juvenile justice, violence, and research and data collection. Additionally, in January 2015, there will be a convening to increase access to STEM and CTE opportunities for marginalized girls and young women, addressing barriers such as cultural competency and discrimination. The aim is to prepare students for high-demand careers in high-growth industry sectors.
