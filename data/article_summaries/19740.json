The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 was signed into law by President Obama to protect American credit card holders from unfair rate hikes and hidden fees. The legislation bans unfair rate increases, retroactive rate increases, and late fee traps. It also enforces fair interest calculation and requires opt-in for over-limit fees. The act enhances disclosure on fees for gift and stored value cards and restricts subprime fees. Credit card contract terms will be disclosed in plain language and in plain sight to help consumers make informed choices. The act holds credit card issuers accountable and increases penalties for violations. It also includes protections for college students and young adults.
