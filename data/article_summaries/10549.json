In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims September as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. He emphasizes the importance of finding a cure for childhood cancer and offers support to those battling the disease. He highlights the progress made in the fight against pediatric cancer, with a significant increase in the survival rate over the past few decades. The administration is dedicated to funding research and improving treatments for childhood cancer. The Affordable Care Act ensures that insurance companies cannot deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions or set lifetime caps on essential health benefits. Starting in January 2014, insurers will also be prohibited from dropping coverage for patients participating in clinical trials, including those for childhood cancer. The proclamation encourages all Americans to join in the commitment to fight childhood cancer and support young people in their journey towards a cancer-free world.
