President Trump awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor to Staff Sergeant Ronald Shurer, an Army Special Forces medic who now serves in the United States Secret Service. Shurer was recognized for his heroic actions during a mission in Afghanistan in 2008, where he braved enemy fire to treat and stabilize wounded soldiers. Despite being diagnosed with cancer, Shurer continues to inspire others with his courage and strength. The President commended Shurer for his service and presented him with the Medal of Honor.
