The families of the victims of the recent massacres in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, are calling for action to prevent further violence. The author of the article, who is from Delaware, applauds their efforts and announces that Delaware has passed a historic assault weapons ban, limits on high-capacity magazines, and improved background checks. Other gun safety bills are also being considered. The author argues that these measures are supported by the majority of Americans and cites the success of the 1994 ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in reducing mass shootings. The author urges Congress to pass a bipartisan gun safety bill and highlights the need for a national response to the crisis. The author concludes by stating that they have taken more executive action on gun crime than any other President in their first year in office.
