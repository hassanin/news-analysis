The article discusses Executive Order 13540, which establishes an Interagency Task Force on Veterans Small Business Development. The task force aims to coordinate the efforts of federal agencies in improving capital, business development opportunities, and federal contracting goals for small businesses owned and controlled by veterans and service-disabled veterans. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration will serve as the chair of the task force, and other members will be representatives from various departments and agencies. The task force will consult with veterans service and military organizations, coordinate administrative and regulatory activities, develop proposals to improve access to capital and contracting opportunities, and reduce administrative burdens on veterans. The Small Business Administration will provide funding and administrative support for the task force, and annual reports on its performance will be submitted to the President. The order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
