The Supreme Court's ruling in West Virginia vs. EPA is seen as a setback for the country's efforts to combat climate change and keep the air clean. The decision is criticized for favoring special interests over the right to breathe clean air. However, the administration is determined to protect public health and tackle the climate crisis. The legal team and Department of Justice will review the decision and find ways to continue protecting Americans from harmful pollution within the confines of federal law. The Clean Air Act, passed in 1970, has been instrumental in reducing air pollution while the economy grew. The administration plans to use executive authority, including the EPA's upheld powers, to maintain clean air and address the climate crisis. They will also work with states and cities to pass and uphold laws that protect citizens and push for additional Congressional action. The goal is to create a clean energy future, address environmental injustice, create jobs, and lower costs for families. The fight against climate change will continue.
