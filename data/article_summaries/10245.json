In an op-ed on USAToday.com, First Lady Michelle Obama discusses the importance of school counselors in helping students pursue higher education. She shares her own experience growing up on the South Side of Chicago, where college counseling was not readily available. While some high schools provide comprehensive college counseling, many schools lack the resources and support for their counselors to effectively guide students. This lack of guidance can be detrimental to students' futures, as a college education is increasingly necessary for career success. The First Lady highlights the disparities in student-to-counselor ratios and the additional responsibilities that burden counselors in some schools. She emphasizes the need to support and recognize school counselors, and discusses the efforts made by universities, foundations, school districts, and non-profit organizations to improve the situation. The White House has issued a challenge to various entities to step up and support school counselors, resulting in millions of dollars being dedicated to these efforts. The U.S. Department of Education has also provided tools to help counselors assist students with financial aid and college applications. Additionally, the First Lady mentions the National School Counselor of the Year ceremony being held at the White House for the first time. Michelle Obama concludes by emphasizing that every young person should have the opportunity to pursue higher education and fulfill their potential, and she and her husband are committed to supporting school counselors in their mission.
