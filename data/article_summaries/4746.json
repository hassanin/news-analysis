In a press conference, President Biden touted the strong economic recovery of the United States, stating that the country is adding jobs at a record pace. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.6%, and job growth in October exceeded expectations. The President highlighted that his administration has created 5.6 million new jobs in the first nine months, a record for any new President. He also mentioned that unemployment claims have decreased, and weekly pay has gone up, particularly for low-paid workers. President Biden attributed the economic success to the American Rescue Plan, the vaccination program, and the implementation of vaccination requirements, which have led to more vaccinated workers and shoppers. He emphasized the importance of continuing to drive vaccinations up and COVID-19 cases down to ensure a full economic recovery. Additionally, the President discussed the recent recommendations for COVID-19 vaccinations for children aged 5-11 and the introduction of a new pill developed by Pfizer that could treat infected individuals. He urged Congress to pass the bipartisan infrastructure agreement and his Build Back Better plan, stating that they will lower costs for families and create millions of jobs. President Biden called on House members to vote in favor of both bills and emphasized the importance of investing in the hopes and future of the American people.
