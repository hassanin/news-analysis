President Obama has announced the creation of the world's largest marine protected area off the coast of Hawaii. The designation will quadruple the size of the existing marine monument, protecting coral reefs, deep-sea marine habitats, and other important ecological features. The President has protected more public lands and waters than any other President, and this designation is part of his commitment to protect the natural beauty of the United States. The President has also called on Congress to provide funding to fight the Zika virus, but Republicans have blocked this funding. The administration has also been working on closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and there are currently around 61 detainees remaining. The President has faced criticism for his use of executive authority, but he remains committed to using it to accomplish his goals before leaving office.
