President Trump's preliminary trade agreement with Mexico has led to markets reaching record highs and industry groups expressing optimism. The new trade deal, which replaces NAFTA, is seen as a major victory for Trump and is expected to benefit American workers and manufacturers. The agreement focuses primarily on autos, with 85 percent of the car's parts needing to be made in North America to qualify for tariff-free imports. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes reached record highs following the news, and global stocks also climbed as investors hoped the deal would help avert a global trade war. The oil industry also sees the deal as an encouraging sign. The agreement is seen as a positive step forward in renegotiating and modernizing NAFTA, with a focus on addressing worker concerns.
