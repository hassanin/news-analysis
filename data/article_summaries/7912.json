On March 1, 2023, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced that he will be continuing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692 for another year. The original order, issued on March 8, 2015, declared a national emergency in response to the situation in Venezuela, citing concerns over human rights violations, political persecution, press freedoms, violence, corruption, and arbitrary arrests. Since then, the President has issued several additional executive orders addressing the ongoing crisis in Venezuela. Despite these measures, the circumstances outlined in the original order and subsequent orders have not improved, and they continue to pose a significant threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The President's decision to extend the national emergency is in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
