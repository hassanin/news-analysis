The White House has released a fact sheet on enhancing the security of the maritime supply chain. The gift basket, which was discussed at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit, focuses on the maritime smuggling pathway and encourages countries to strengthen their role in preventing nuclear trafficking. The gift basket calls for countries to maintain effective radiation detection systems at their large container seaports and to help other countries develop their own detection capabilities. It also calls for an international workshop by 2016 to share experiences and best practices in detecting and removing nuclear and radiological materials from the global maritime supply chain. The United States has already worked with partner countries to build their capacities to detect and interdict illicit trafficking of dangerous materials, and multiple countries and organizations are working to equip their seaports with radiation detection systems. These systems have been successful in detecting nuclear materials out of regulatory control, highlighting the importance of radiation detection at international checkpoints.
