The article discusses the energy deliverables that were announced at the North American Leaders Summit in 2009. The three main areas of focus were carbon capture and storage (CCS), gas flaring reduction, and energy efficiency. 

Regarding CCS, the three nations committed to producing a North American Carbon Atlas to map carbon emissions and potential storage sites. They also aimed to collaborate on research and development projects related to CCS technologies. This collaboration would help accelerate technology commercialization.

In terms of gas flaring reduction, the United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed to promote best practices to reduce the wasteful flaring of natural gas associated with oil production. They also aimed to cooperate with existing multilateral fora, such as the World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership and the Methane to Markets Partnership.

On energy efficiency, the three countries agreed to continue collaborative efforts to ensure energy efficiency standards are aligned and consistent with national objectives. Officials responsible for developing these standards would continue to meet and consider their respective plans.

Lastly, the article mentions North American clean energy cooperation, specifically in the development of a 21st century smart grid. The aim was to enhance the reliability, efficiency, and security of the electric systems in the three countries by incorporating advanced technologies like microprocessors, communications, and information technologies. The North American Synchrophasor Initiative was also mentioned as a project to create a synchronized data measurement infrastructure for the electric power system.

Overall, the energy deliverables announced at the summit aimed to address climate change, improve energy efficiency, and promote clean energy technologies in North America.
