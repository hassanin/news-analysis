On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the United States Declaration of Independence, proclaiming the colonies as free and independent states. Today, we celebrate our nation's independence and the vision of our Founding Fathers. The commitment to liberty and justice that defined our American spirit from the beginning continues to guide our nation forward. Despite recent challenges, we must ensure that we uphold the ideals of our Declaration of Independence and protect the freedoms that make our country great. The First Lady and President wish every American a happy Fourth of July and join in celebrating our nation.
