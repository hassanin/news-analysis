During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest discussed the upcoming meeting between President Obama and President Putin at the United Nations. Earnest stated that the top item on the agenda for the meeting would be Ukraine, and that the President would reinforce to Putin the importance of Russia keeping their commitments in the Minsk agreements. Earnest also mentioned that the President would encourage Putin to consider contributing to the counter-ISIL effort in Syria. Additionally, Earnest addressed concerns about Russia's increased military involvement in Syria and stated that the President's message to Putin would be similar to the public message, which is that Russia's support for the Assad regime is a losing bet and only deepens the crisis in Syria. Earnest also discussed the possibility of a government shutdown and the President's willingness to sign a short-term continuing resolution (CR) to avoid a shutdown. He emphasized the importance of finding a bipartisan agreement on funding national security and economic priorities. Earnest also addressed the Pope's visit and the impact it may have on diplomatic goals with China. He stated that the White House is not concerned about the Pope's visit overshadowing the visit of President Xi and that the President will discuss common interests and productive talks with China. Earnest also mentioned the refugee crisis and stated that the United States is prepared to accept at least 10,000 refugees in the next fiscal year. Finally, Earnest discussed intelligence assessments and emphasized the importance of accurate and timely intelligence in making effective policy decisions.
