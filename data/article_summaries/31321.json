This article discusses the issue of unaccompanied alien children (UAC) who illegally enter the United States and the limited number of them that are ultimately removed. It states that only about 3.5 percent of unaccompanied minors apprehended at the border are actually removed. Tens of thousands of UAC are released into the interior of the United States each year, including over 107,000 since fiscal year 2016. The article argues that loopholes in immigration laws hinder immigration enforcement efforts, allowing UAC to enter and remain in the country while avoiding removal. These loopholes include a consent decree that limits the detention of UAC to a maximum of 20 days and federal laws that prevent prompt return of UAC to their home countries. As a result, catch and release practices have allowed the majority of UAC to avoid removal and remain in the country. The article calls for closing these loopholes to enable fair and effective immigration enforcement efforts.
