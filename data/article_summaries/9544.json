President Obama has declared a major disaster in the District of Columbia and authorized federal aid to assist in the recovery efforts from a snowstorm that occurred in January 2016. The federal funding will be available to the district and certain nonprofit organizations for emergency protective measures and snow assistance. The funding will also cover hazard mitigation measures. Donald L. Keldsen has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested and deemed necessary based on further damage assessments.
