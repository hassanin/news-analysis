President Biden has proclaimed November 2021 as National Family Caregivers Month in recognition of the important role that family caregivers play in providing essential care and medical assistance to their loved ones. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the sacrifices made by caregivers, who often have to sacrifice jobs and alter careers to fulfill their caregiving duties. The high costs of caregiving and the challenges faced by caregivers are also acknowledged. The American Rescue Plan has provided additional funding for the National Family Caregiver Support Program and Medicaid to strengthen home- and community-based services. The Build Back Better agenda aims to further invest in the caregiving infrastructure and increase pay and benefits for the direct care workforce. The President also emphasizes the need to expand paid family and medical leave nationwide. The RAISE Family Caregiving Advisory Council has delivered a report on how governments and the private sector can better support family caregivers. President Biden, having personal experience with family caregivers, encourages all Americans to honor and thank those who provide care for their family members, friends, and neighbors in need.
