President Donald Trump has responded to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's concerns about security during the State of the Union address. In a letter, Trump states that he had already accepted Pelosi's invitation to address the nation on January 29th, and that the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service have confirmed that there are no security concerns. Trump expresses his intention to honor the invitation and fulfill his constitutional duty to deliver important information to the people and Congress. He concludes by stating that it would be unfortunate if the State of the Union were not delivered on time and on location.
