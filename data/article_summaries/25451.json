President Trump held a meeting in the Cabinet Room to discuss the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, which aims to deliver jobs, investment, and growth to underserved communities in the United States. The Council will coordinate efforts across the federal government to support economically distressed communities, including Opportunity Zones. These zones, designated by governors under the new tax cuts, offer tax incentives for private investment in areas that need it the most. The Council will work to streamline regulations, improve education, promote affordable housing, reduce crime, and expand job opportunities and training. Several Cabinet members spoke during the meeting, highlighting the potential impact of the Opportunity Zones on various sectors, such as education, energy, transportation, and agriculture. President Trump also mentioned the ongoing trade negotiations with China and the possibility of imposing tariffs on Mexican cars if Mexico does not take sufficient action to address immigration issues and drug trafficking.
