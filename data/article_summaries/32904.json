The article discusses two bills that were recently passed by the House of Representatives in the United States. The first bill is called Kate's Law, which increases the penalties for illegal immigrants who repeatedly enter the country illegally. The bill is named after Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had been deported multiple times. The second bill is called the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which restricts grant money to cities that refuse to turn over dangerous criminal aliens to federal authorities. The article argues that these bills are necessary for public safety and national security, as many Americans are victimized by illegal immigrants who have been deported multiple times. The article also mentions two additional provisions in the House bill, Grant's Law and Sarah's Law, which aim to prevent the release of dangerous criminals awaiting removal proceedings. The author calls on the Senate to pass these bills and emphasizes the importance of protecting American lives.
