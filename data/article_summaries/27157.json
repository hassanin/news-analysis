The United States expresses its solidarity with the United Kingdom in the wake of a nerve agent attack on a British citizen and his daughter. The US agrees with the UK's assessment that Russia is responsible for the attack and supports the expulsion of Russian diplomats as a just response. The US sees this action as part of a pattern in which Russia disregards international rules, undermines the sovereignty and security of countries, and tries to undermine Western democratic institutions. The US is collaborating with its allies to prevent similar attacks in the future.
