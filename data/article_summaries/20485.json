President Obama signed the Ultralight Aircraft Smuggling Prevention Act of 2012, which aims to combat illicit drug trafficking on the Northern and Southern Borders of the United States. The President expressed his pride in signing the bill alongside Gabby Giffords, a former Congresswoman who has dedicated her career to the safety of the people of Arizona. The bill passed unanimously, demonstrating the respect Giffords has from her colleagues in Congress from both parties. President Obama praised Giffords' dedication to fairness and her inspiration to many, including himself. He wished her well in her recovery and expressed confidence that this legislation would not be her last act of public service.
