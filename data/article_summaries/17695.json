This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama, declaring the creation of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. The proclamation explains that the area is composed of two units, the Canyons Unit and the Seamounts Unit, which contain unique ecological resources including deep-sea corals, fish, whales, and other marine mammals. The canyons and seamounts are home to a diverse range of species and provide important habitats and feeding grounds. The proclamation also establishes regulations and restrictions on activities within the monument, such as prohibiting oil and gas exploration and commercial fishing, while allowing for research, recreational fishing, and other activities that do not impact the resources. The management of the monument will be shared between the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior, and a joint management plan will be developed. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of preserving the marine environment and acknowledges the need to balance conservation with other uses of the sea.
