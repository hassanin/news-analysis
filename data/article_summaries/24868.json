In this article, President Barack Obama announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia. The declaration was made on October 21, 1995, and the circumstances that led to the declaration have not been resolved. The actions of significant narcotics traffickers in Colombia continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, as well as cause violence, corruption, and harm both domestically and abroad. To combat this, the President has determined that it is necessary to maintain economic pressure on these traffickers by blocking their assets and access to the US market and financial system. The national emergency will continue for another year.
