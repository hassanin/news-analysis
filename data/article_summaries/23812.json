The article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney aboard Air Force One en route to Denver, Colorado. Carney discusses President Obama's meeting with law enforcement officials in Denver and his support for common-sense measures to reduce gun violence. He emphasizes that the legislation the President supports, including closing loopholes in the background check system, is supported by the majority of Americans, including gun owners and members of the NRA. Carney also addresses concerns about the venue for the speech and the perception that these measures are losing steam in Congress. He states that the President is committed to pressing this agenda and believes it is the right thing to do for the safety of children and potential victims of gun violence. Carney also briefly touches on other topics such as the Keystone pipeline, North Korea, and immigration reform.
