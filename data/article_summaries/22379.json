The White House Office of the Press Secretary issued a message to Congress from President Barack Obama regarding an Agreement on Social Security between the United States and the Swiss Confederation. The agreement, signed on December 3, 2012, aims to coordinate social security systems between the two countries, eliminating dual coverage and taxation and protecting benefits for workers with careers in both countries. The agreement updates rules for entitlement to Swiss disability pensions, ensures equality of treatment between U.S. and Swiss nationals, and includes provisions for personal information confidentiality. The agreement replaces previous agreements signed in 1979 and 1988. The Social Security Administration has prepared a report explaining the key points of the agreement, along with a paragraph-by-paragraph explanation of the provisions. The Department of State and the Social Security Administration have recommended the agreement to President Obama.
