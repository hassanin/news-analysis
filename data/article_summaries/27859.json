The US economy experienced a record-breaking growth of 7.4% (33.1% at an annual rate) in the third quarter of 2020, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This growth follows a severe contraction in the second quarter due to the pandemic. The US has now recovered two-thirds of the economic output lost in the first half of the year. The strong recovery is attributed to President Trump's pro-growth policies and the government's support for families and businesses. Consumer spending, particularly in the services sector, played a significant role in the third quarter's GDP growth. The aid provided by the government, totaling $2.7 trillion, helped support Americans' income and contributed to the resurgence in consumer spending. The US economy is expected to continue expanding in the fourth quarter.
