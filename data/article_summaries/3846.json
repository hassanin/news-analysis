President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894 regarding the situation in Syria will continue beyond October 14, 2022. The President cites the actions of the Government of Turkey, including a military offensive into northeast Syria, as undermining the campaign against ISIS, endangering civilians, and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region. The President deems it necessary to continue the national emergency due to the unusual and extraordinary threat it poses to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
