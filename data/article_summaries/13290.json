Dr. Lawrence H. Summers, Director of the National Economic Council and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, has announced his plans to return to Harvard University at the end of the year. Dr. Summers has been the chief White House advisor to the President on economic policy and has helped guide the country through the recession. President Obama expressed his gratitude for Dr. Summers' leadership and counsel, and although he will be missed at the White House, he will continue to seek his advice on an informal basis. Dr. Summers will be returning to Harvard to teach and write about job creation, stable finance, and the integration of developing countries into the global system. He has been instrumental in coordinating economic policy making across the Administration and has been involved in various initiatives such as the Recovery Act, job creation measures, the Financial Stability Program, restructuring the automobile industry, managing international economic relationships, developing the President's health care plan, and participating in international climate negotiations.
