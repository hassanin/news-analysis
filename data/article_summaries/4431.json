The Vice President, Kamala Harris, delivered a speech at the EMILY's List 2023 Annual Gala in Washington, D.C. She began by thanking the leader of EMILY's List, Laphonza Butler, for her tireless effort and leadership. Harris expressed her gratitude to the board of EMILY's List and congratulated Fentrice Driskell, this year's "Rising Star" leader.

Harris shared a saying from her mother, which is to be the first but not the last, and expressed her confidence that EMILY's List will continue to support and empower women in leadership roles. She then praised Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi for her historic leadership, particularly in passing the Affordable Care Act and expanding healthcare coverage for millions of Americans.

The Vice President criticized the attacks on women's reproductive rights, highlighting the restrictive abortion laws that have been proposed and passed in various states. She called out the hypocrisy of those who claim to protect mothers and babies while ignoring the maternal mortality crisis and the lack of access to healthcare for many women, particularly Black, Native, and rural women.

Harris also condemned the broader attacks on democracy and freedom, including efforts to restrict voting rights, ban certain books, and eliminate classes that teach gender equality. She emphasized the importance of organizing and voting in elections to protect these rights, citing recent victories in Kentucky, California, Michigan, Kansas, and New Mexico.

The Vice President urged the audience to stand up for voting rights, LGBTQ+ rights, comprehensive education, reproductive rights, economic support for families, and gun control. She emphasized that their fight is rooted in love for their country and ended her speech by declaring that when they fight, they win.
