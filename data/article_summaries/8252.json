In a recent address from the Roosevelt Room, President Biden delivered a direct message to the American people regarding the Omicron variant of COVID-19. He stated that due to the steps taken, Omicron has not spread as rapidly in the US as it has in Europe. However, he emphasized that the variant is now present and spreading, especially among the unvaccinated. The President warned that the unvaccinated may face a winter of severe illness and death for themselves, their families, and the overwhelmed hospitals. On a positive note, he highlighted that individuals who are vaccinated and have received their booster shots are protected from severe illness and death. The President urged people to get their booster shots, stating that they are free, safe, and convenient. He mentioned that around 60 million people have already received their booster shots. The President emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated to protect the economic recovery, keep schools and businesses open, and enable people to enjoy the upcoming holidays. He encouraged individuals who haven't received their booster shots to do so and urged those who haven't received any shots to get their first dose. President Biden provided statistics on the vaccination progress in the US, with 83 percent of Americans aged 12 and older having received at least one shot and 202 million people being fully vaccinated. He also mentioned that there have been 57 million booster shots administered, with one million being given per day. The President reiterated that Omicron will spread more rapidly in the coming year and emphasized that the only real protection is to get vaccinated. He concluded by urging people to take action now and get vaccinated.
