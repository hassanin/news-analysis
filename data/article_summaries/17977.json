President Obama congratulates the House of Representatives for passing the DREAM Act with a bipartisan vote. He believes that this is the right thing to do for talented young people who want to serve the country through education or military service. He also emphasizes that the DREAM Act would cut the deficit by $2.2 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The President urges the U.S. Senate to also pass the DREAM Act so that he can sign it into law. He sees this vote as an important step in addressing the nation's most pressing problems and correcting flaws in the immigration system. President Obama emphasizes that the DREAM Act is not amnesty, but about accountability and tapping into the talent of young individuals who have already been invested in. He promises to continue working on immigration reform.
