The White House has released a fact sheet outlining President Obama's plan to simplify the tax code and make it fairer for middle class families. The plan includes closing loopholes that benefit the wealthy, raising the top capital gains and dividend rate, and reforming financial sector taxation. The savings from these reforms would be used to pay for investments in education, child care, and retirement savings. The plan also includes a new tax credit for two-earner families, a streamlined child care tax incentive, simplified education tax benefits, and expanded access to retirement savings options.
