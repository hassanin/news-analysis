On December 20, 2017, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency regarding serious human rights abuse and corruption worldwide. This declaration was made in accordance with the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The President took related measures to address the threat posed to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. The President argues that the prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption originating from outside the United States continue to pose an extraordinary threat to the country. As a result, the national emergency declared in December 2017 will be extended beyond December 20, 2018, for another year. This decision is made under section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
