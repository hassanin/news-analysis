The article discusses the historic steps taken by the United States and Canada to protect the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. The majority of Arctic waters and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean have been designated as off-limits to future oil and gas leasing. This decision is based on the scientific assessment that the risks of an oil spill in these regions are significant and the ability to clean up such spills is limited. Additionally, the article mentions that it would take decades to develop the necessary infrastructure for large-scale oil and gas production in the Arctic, and that current oil prices do not support significant production in the region. The focus should now be on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond the oil and gas sector, with investments in infrastructure, collective security, and future industries. The article also provides links to related fact sheets and maps detailing the specific areas protected from oil and gas activity.
