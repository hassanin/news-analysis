The United States and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have reached an agreement regarding the United States-UAE Open Skies agreement. The agreement aims to benefit workers in the American airline industry, such as pilots, flight attendants, and machinists. The understanding acknowledges that government subsidies can undermine fair competition and the UAE has committed to financial transparency and adherence to internationally-recognized standards. The UAE also informed the US that its air carriers have no plans to start new commercial flight routes of concern to US carriers. This agreement mirrors the one made with Qatar earlier this year. The understanding is the result of a White House task force and demonstrates President Trump's commitment to American jobs and companies.
