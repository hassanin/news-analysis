In this letter, President Barack Obama discusses the proposed designations for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has revised the Comprehensive Conservation Plan and completed an environmental impact statement for the refuge. Based on the best available science and public comment, the Service recommends designating 12.28 million acres, including the Coastal Plain, as wilderness. The Service also suggests including four rivers into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The revised plan aims to preserve subsistence uses, protect fish and wildlife populations and habitats, and provide opportunities for recreation and other public uses. The plan also emphasizes monitoring wildlife, habitat, and public use in response to changing conditions, particularly related to climate change. President Obama recommends that Congress pass legislation to protect this area, as it is considered a national treasure and should be preserved for future generations.
