Verizon and AT&T have agreed to delay the deployment of 5G around certain airports in order to ensure the safe coexistence of aviation operations and 5G technology. This agreement aims to avoid disruptions to passenger travel, cargo operations, and the economic recovery while still allowing the majority of wireless tower deployment to proceed as planned. The deal will protect flight safety and bring high-speed internet options to millions of Americans. The government has been working closely with wireless carriers, airlines, and aviation equipment manufacturers to find a permanent solution for the coexistence of 5G and aviation operations.
