President Barack Obama signed a Presidential Memorandum on scientific integrity, aiming to restore scientific integrity in government decision making. The memorandum assigns the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) the responsibility of ensuring the highest level of integrity in the executive branch's involvement with scientific and technological issues. Within 120 days, the Director of OSTP must develop a strategy to ensure that the selection of scientists and technology professionals is based on their knowledge, credentials, and experience. Additionally, agencies must make scientific or technological findings available to the public, use information that has undergone scientific processes such as peer review, and establish rules and procedures to protect the integrity of the scientific process, including whistleblower protection. The goal is to guide public policy decisions with accurate and objective scientific advice and to build trust in the public regarding the transparency and integrity of scientific findings relevant to policy choices.
