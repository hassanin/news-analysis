President Trump is pleased with the Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. Mazars, which stated that Congress must have a valid legislative purpose when using subpoenas for fact-finding and cannot act as a roving investigative body against a co-equal branch of government. Last year, Democrat-run House committees subpoenaed Trump's financial records for partisan advantage, but the Supreme Court saw through their claims and declared that more is needed to establish a valid legislative purpose. The Court also protected Trump's financial records from intrusive subpoenas by a partisan district attorney in Trump v. Vance, stating that further proceedings are required to establish access. Despite any harassment or distractions, President Trump remains committed to fulfilling his promises to the American people.
