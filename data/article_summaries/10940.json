President Obama spoke with Egyptian President Abdelfattah al-Sisi about the U.S.-Egyptian military assistance relationship and regional developments. President Obama informed President al-Sisi that he will lift executive holds on the delivery of F-16 aircraft, Harpoon missiles, and M1A1 tank kits. He also stated that he will continue to request an annual $1.3 billion in military assistance for Egypt. Starting in fiscal year 2018, U.S. security assistance for Egypt will be channeled towards counterterrorism, border security, Sinai security, and maritime security, as well as the sustainment of weapons systems already in Egypt's arsenal. President Obama expressed concerns about Egypt's imprisonment of non-violent activists and mass trials, and encouraged increased respect for freedom of speech and assembly. The two leaders agreed to stay in touch in the future.
