During National Disability Employment Awareness Month, President Biden highlights the contributions of disabled Americans and emphasizes the need for equal opportunity. He acknowledges the historical discrimination faced by disabled individuals and praises the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990. However, he recognizes that there is still progress to be made, as disabled Americans face challenges in employment, promotions, and fair pay. President Biden has taken steps to address these issues, including issuing an Executive Order promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the federal government workforce. The Labor Department is cracking down on discrimination in the private sector and ending the use of sub-minimum wages. Additionally, the administration is expanding access to transit and updating infrastructure to facilitate travel and work for people with disabilities. Amid the pandemic, efforts are being made to assist those with long COVID in understanding their rights and obtaining necessary workplace accommodations. President Biden urges Americans to recognize and embrace the talents and skills of workers with disabilities, promoting equal employment opportunities for all.
