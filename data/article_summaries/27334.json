The article highlights the importance of National Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month in acknowledging the challenges faced by Americans with sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD is an inherited red blood cell disorder that primarily affects those with ancestors from sub-Saharan Africa and certain regions of South and Central America. The prevalence of SCD in the United States is 1 in every 365 African-American births and 1 in every 16,300 Hispanic-American births. Individuals with SCD experience lifelong pain, disabilities, and premature death. The article discusses the financial burden of SCD, with medical expenses for children with SCD averaging between $11,000 and $14,000, and nearly 40 percent of these patients requiring hospital stays. While there have been medical advances in the treatment of SCD, many treatments are only available to a specific subset of patients, and often patients are not identified until irreversible organ damage has occurred. The National Institutes of Health is conducting research to identify children at a higher risk of severe SCD through genetic modifiers. The administration is also exploring new payment models to make treatments more affordable and working with organizations to develop education and training programs for healthcare providers. The article emphasizes the commitment to improving the quality of life for individuals living with SCD.
