The article discusses the importance of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the potential consequences of abolishing the agency. President Donald J. Trump emphasizes that ICE plays a vital role in keeping the country safe by eradicating dangerous criminals.

It would also lead to an increase in the flow of illegal drugs and hinder efforts to prevent terrorism.
