The article states that the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels will continue. The national emergency was declared in 1996 in response to the Cuban government's destruction of two unarmed US civilian aircraft in international airspace. The scope of the emergency was expanded in 2004 to deny support to the Cuban government. The Cuban government has not shown that it will refrain from using excessive force against US vessels or aircraft engaged in memorial activities or peaceful protests near Cuba. Unauthorized entry of US-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is still seen as detrimental to US foreign policy. The continuation of the national emergency and emergency authority is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
