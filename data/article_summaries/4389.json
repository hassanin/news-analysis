On May 16, 2012, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the actions and policies of certain members of the Yemeni government that threatened the peace, security, and stability of Yemen. These actions included obstructing the political process and blocking the implementation of a November 2011 agreement for a peaceful transition of power. The national emergency, declared under Executive Order 13611, was set to expire on May 16, 2023. However, due to the ongoing threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, President Biden has extended the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This extension was announced on May 11, 2023, and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
