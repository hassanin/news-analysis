The President of the United States, Barack Obama, has issued a notice regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This emergency was initially declared in 2006 due to the widespread violence and atrocities in the country that posed a threat to regional stability and the foreign policy of the United States. The President has determined that this situation still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat, and therefore, the national emergency will continue for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
