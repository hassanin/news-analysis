President Barack Obama will be awarding the Medal of Honor to Army First Lieutenant Alonzo H. Cushing for his actions during the Civil War. Cushing will receive the award posthumously for his bravery while serving as commanding officer of Battery A, 4th United States Artillery, during the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Despite being wounded, Cushing continued to operate the only functioning field piece in his battery and directed its fire against the advancing Confederate forces. He was ultimately shot and killed during the assault, but his actions helped repulse the attack. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who display extraordinary bravery or self-sacrifice in the face of great risk.
