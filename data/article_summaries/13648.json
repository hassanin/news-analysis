This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama in October 2010. It outlines the refugee admissions numbers and authorizations for Fiscal Year 2011. The memorandum states that up to 80,000 refugees will be admitted to the United States in FY 2011 based on humanitarian concerns or national interest. The admissions will include those provided with federal refugee resettlement assistance under the Amerasian immigrant admissions program. The memorandum also allocates the admissions numbers among different regions, including Africa, East Asia, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America/Caribbean, Near East/South Asia, and an unallocated reserve. The unallocated refugee numbers can be allocated to regional ceilings as needed. The Secretary of State is authorized to use unallocated admissions in regions where additional admissions are needed, as well as transfer unused admissions from one region to another if there is a greater need. The memorandum also designates certain persons applying for admission to the United States as refugees under the overseas refugee admissions program and specifies that persons in Cuba, the former Soviet Union, Iraq, and under exceptional circumstances, those identified by a US Embassy in any location, may be considered refugees for admission to the United States. The Secretary of State is directed to report this determination to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
