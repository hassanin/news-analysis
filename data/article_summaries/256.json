In a background briefing, senior administration officials discussed the United States' historic vaccine donation that President Biden will announce, as well as a preview of the President's bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and a preview of the G7 Summit and economic deliverables. The US has successfully vaccinated a large percentage of its population and is now focused on helping end the pandemic globally. The President will announce that the US will purchase 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccine and donate them to 100 low-income countries, making it the largest purchase and donation of COVID-19 vaccines by a single country. The doses will be delivered starting in August, with 200 million doses to be delivered this year and the remaining 300 million in the first half of 2022. The US will work with COVAX and other organizations to ensure the doses are distributed and administered effectively. The total cost of the donation is estimated to be $3.5 billion. This announcement is part of the US's commitment to being the "arsenal of vaccines" in the global fight against COVID-19.
