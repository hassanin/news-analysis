This article is a notice from the White House stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. The national emergency was initially declared on March 15, 1995, due to the actions and policies of the Iranian government that posed a threat to the United States' national security, foreign policy, and economy. Since then, several executive orders have been issued to impose sanctions on Iran. However, on July 14, 2015, a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was reached between Iran, the P5+1 countries (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), and the European Union, to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. As a result, nuclear-related sanctions on Iran were lifted. However, non-nuclear related sanctions remain in place. Despite the JCPOA, certain actions and policies of the Iranian government still pose a threat to the United States, leading to the continuation of the national emergency. The renewal of the national emergency is for one year and must be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
