President Obama has launched the "Stand Stronger" Citizenship Awareness Campaign to encourage eligible immigrants to commit to citizenship. There are approximately 13.3 million lawful permanent residents (LPRs) living in the US, and 8.8 million of them are eligible for citizenship. The campaign aims to break down barriers for immigrants and refugees to become citizens and promote the rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of citizenship. The campaign is a project of nonprofit Civic Nation, with assistance from the White House and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It includes partnerships with community organizations, businesses, and local governments to provide assistance and resources to eligible immigrants. Private sector commitments to the campaign include the New Americans Campaign, the National Partnership for New Americans, Cities for Citizenship, and the New American Workforce.
