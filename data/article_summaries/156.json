The Biden-Harris Administration has released plans from over 20 federal agencies outlining steps to make their facilities and operations more resilient to climate change impacts. These plans reflect President Biden's whole-of-government approach to addressing the climate crisis. By integrating climate-readiness across their missions and programs, the agencies aim to strengthen the resilience of federal assets from the accelerating impacts of climate change. The plans were reviewed by the National Climate Task Force, White House Council on Environmental Quality's Federal Chief Sustainability Officer, and the Office of Management and Budget in response to President Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis. The plans address various risks caused by climate change, such as infrastructure damage, program effectiveness, and health risks to federal employees. The agencies will embed adaptation and resilience planning throughout their operations and programs and continually update their plans. The plans also align with President Biden's Build Back Better Agenda and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, which include investments to strengthen the nation's resilience to climate change. The Council on Environmental Quality and the Office of Management and Budget are seeking public input on the agency climate adaptation plans. The plans from the major federal agencies are available for public review.
