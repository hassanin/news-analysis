President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to Ethiopia, which was declared in Executive Order 14046 on September 17, 2021, will continue beyond September 17, 2022. The situation in northern Ethiopia has been marked by activities that threaten the peace, security, and stability of Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa region. These activities include widespread violence, atrocities, serious human rights abuses, ethnic-based violence, gender-based violence, and obstruction of humanitarian operations. President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency in order to address these threats to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
