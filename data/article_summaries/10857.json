It also discusses the progress made in transitioning to a low-carbon economy, including the increase in renewable energy capacity and the reduction in carbon intensity of fossil fuel-fired generation. The report emphasizes the economic benefits of policies implemented during the Obama Administration, such as the national standards for power plants and vehicles, and the extension of tax credits for wind and solar projects. Additionally, the report acknowledges the Administration's efforts in international cooperation to combat climate change, including the signing of the Paris Agreement.
