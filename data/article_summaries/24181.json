The White House has released a report on the impact of middle-class tax cuts on retailers and consumer spending. The report highlights the consequences if Congress fails to extend these tax cuts. It states that if taxes go up on 98 percent of Americans at the end of the year, it will negatively impact businesses and retailers across the nation. The report also emphasizes the importance of renewing middle-class tax cuts to provide certainty for families and businesses during the holiday shopping season. It mentions that if Congress fails to act, middle-class families will see their income taxes go up by $2,200 next year. The President believes in a balanced approach to reduce the deficit, including asking the wealthy to pay a little more. The report concludes by stating that extending tax cuts for the middle class is a priority and there is no reason to delay acting on it. It also highlights the potential decline in consumer spending and GDP growth if middle-class taxes rise.
