This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq will continue for another year. The national emergency was initially declared in 2003 due to the threats posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by obstacles to the reconstruction, peace, security, and development of Iraq. The continuation of the national emergency is necessary because these obstacles still exist. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress. The notice is signed by President Barack Obama.
