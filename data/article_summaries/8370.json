During a teleconference, US officials confirmed that Russian military personnel based in Crimea have been piloting Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to conduct strikes across Ukraine, including in Kyiv. The US believes that Iranian military personnel were on the ground in Crimea to assist Russia in these operations. Russia has received dozens of UAVs from Iran and is expected to continue receiving more in the future. The US plans to expose, deter, and confront Iran's provision of these munitions to Russia and will continue to enforce sanctions on both countries. The US is also exploring new sanctions and working with allies to address Iran's proliferation of weapons to Russia. Additionally, the US is considering providing air defense solutions to Ukraine and is working with allies to provide support. The US is committed to helping Ukraine defend itself and will continue to provide security and financial assistance.
