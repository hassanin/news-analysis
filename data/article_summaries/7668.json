President Biden is traveling to Florida to discuss two contrasting visions for the American people. He will be joined by Democratic officials to highlight how the Inflation Reduction Act is lowering costs for Americans, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug costs for the first time. In contrast, Republican officials, led by Senator Rick Scott, have a different vision that would result in millions of Americans losing healthcare coverage and other protections. The President will emphasize this contrast and reaffirm his commitment to strengthening Medicare and Social Security. The President also provided an update on the federal assistance provided to Florida for hurricane recovery efforts. During the press conference, questions were asked about the President's response to the attack on Speaker Pelosi's husband, as well as his stance on political violence and threats leading up to the midterm elections. The President's spokesperson condemned political violence and expressed the administration's commitment to protecting the right to vote. The spokesperson also addressed questions about the President's remarks on oil and gas companies paying higher taxes and the administration's actions regarding the situation in Haiti. Additionally, the spokesperson mentioned that the President will deliver remarks after the midterm elections, but did not provide details on whether he will take questions.
