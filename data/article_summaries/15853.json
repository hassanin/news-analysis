President Barack Obama issued a memorandum designating officers of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to act as the Director of OPM in the event that both the Director and Deputy Director are unable to perform their duties. The order of succession is as follows: General Counsel, Chief of Staff, Chief Management Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Associate Director of Employee Services, Associate Director of Retirement Services, and Other Associate Directors in the order of their appointment. The memorandum also states that individuals serving in an acting capacity cannot act as Director and that the President has the discretion to depart from this memorandum in designating an acting Director. This memorandum revokes a previous memorandum issued on May 21, 2012. The memorandum does not create any rights or benefits enforceable by any party.
