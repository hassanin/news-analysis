President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum titled "Plan to Defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)" on January 28, 2017. The memorandum states that ISIS is one of the most vicious and aggressive threats from radical Islamic terrorism, and it is attempting to create its own state. The memorandum directs the Administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS. It highlights the violent murders of American citizens by ISIS, as well as the attacks inspired by ISIS in the United States and on American allies. The memorandum emphasizes the need for decisive action to defeat ISIS and outlines the policy coordination and development process for the plan. The plan is expected to include a comprehensive strategy, changes to rules of engagement, public diplomacy and cyber strategies, identification of new coalition partners, mechanisms to cut off ISIS's financial support, and a strategy for funding the plan. The memorandum authorizes and directs the Secretary of Defense to publish it in the Federal Register.
