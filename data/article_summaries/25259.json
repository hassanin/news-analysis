On National HIV Testing Day, the importance of testing and awareness in the fight against HIV and AIDS is emphasized. Currently, there are 1.1 million people living with HIV in America, 15 percent of whom are unaware of their status. Additionally, only 50 percent of young Americans infected with the virus are aware of their condition. Those who are unaware of their HIV status put themselves and others at risk, as they miss out on life-saving treatment and may unknowingly transmit the virus. Routine HIV testing is crucial in interrupting the chain of transmission. Efforts to diagnose and treat more people have resulted in improved health outcomes for those living with HIV. The administration is committed to supporting domestic and global health programs that prioritize testing and treatment for HIV/AIDS.
