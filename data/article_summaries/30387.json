President Donald J. Trump has increased disaster assistance for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in response to Super Typhoon Yutu. The President's order authorizes a 100 percent federal funding share for hazard mitigation measures associated with sections 404 and 406 of the Stafford Act. However, there are two conditions: CNMI must maintain the 2018 International Building Code throughout the disaster, and they must prioritize mitigation projects for critical infrastructure approved by the FEMA Region IX Regional Administrator.
