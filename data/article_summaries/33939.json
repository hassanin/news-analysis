President Donald J. Trump has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands following Super Typhoon Yutu. Previously, federal funding was available at 75 percent of total eligible costs for Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance. Now, under the President's order, federal funds for all categories of assistance are authorized at 90 percent of total eligible costs. Debris removal and emergency protective measures are authorized at 100 percent for 180 days from the start of the incident. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA news desk.
