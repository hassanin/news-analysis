President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Alabama and ordered federal aid to support recovery efforts in areas affected by Hurricane Zeta. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in several counties, including Clarke, Dallas, Marengo, Mobile, Perry, Washington, and Wilcox. Assistance may include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in additional counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are eligible for cost-sharing funding. Allan Jarvis has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will be operational seven days a week until further notice.
