The article discusses the inefficiency and restrictions surrounding infrastructure funding by the Federal Government. It clarifies that the Federal Government funds around 20 percent, not 80 percent, of total infrastructure investment. The level of Federal investment varies by sector, with 28 percent for highways and 4 percent for water infrastructure. Federal funding is often directed by Washington's priorities and comes with many strings attached. Despite State and local governments owning the majority of infrastructure, Federal impediments remain. The President's infrastructure proposal aims to maintain the balance of Federal and non-Federal funding, while stretching each taxpayer dollar and delivering on local needs. It includes an Incentives Program that provides grants to promote new infrastructure investment at the State and local level. The proposal also involves divestiture of Federal assets to keep funding decisions in the hands of State and local entities. Ultimately, the proposal aims to increase investments in repairing and modernizing American infrastructure.
