The White House Council of Economic Advisers released a report called "Missed Opportunities: The Consequences of State Decisions Not to Expand Medicaid." The report discusses the effects of states' decisions regarding Medicaid expansion on access to care, financial security, overall health and well-being of residents, and state economies. The Affordable Care Act provides financial support to states that choose to expand Medicaid eligibility to non-elderly individuals in families with incomes below 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. So far, 26 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, resulting in 5.2 million people gaining Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage. However, 24 states have chosen not to expand Medicaid, leaving millions of their citizens without health insurance coverage. If these states do not change course, it is estimated that 5.7 million people will be deprived of health insurance coverage in 2016. Additionally, these states will miss out on billions of dollars in federal funding that could boost their economies. The report uses evidence from economics and health policy to quantify the consequences of states' decisions, although the actual effects of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act may differ. However, it is clear that the consequences of states' decisions have far-reaching implications for the health and well-being of their citizens, state economies, and the nation as a whole.
