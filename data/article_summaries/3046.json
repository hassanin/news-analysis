The Florida Senate has passed House Bill 5, which would ban access to abortions after 15 weeks. This bill has been described as extreme and a violation of women's right to make decisions about their own bodies. If signed into law, it would block access to reproductive health care, particularly impacting low-income, communities of color, and rural communities. Similar unconstitutional abortion bans and restrictive bills are being considered in other state legislatures. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to protecting access to healthcare and defending a woman's right to make decisions about her body and future.
