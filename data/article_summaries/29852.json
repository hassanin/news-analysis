President Trump announced a new executive order that expands authorities to target individuals, companies, and financial institutions that finance and facilitate trade with North Korea. The order aims to cut off sources of revenue that fund North Korea's weapons development. China has also been instructed by its central bank to immediately stop doing business with North Korea. The order gives the Treasury Department the power to sanction any foreign bank that conducts or facilitates significant transactions tied to trade with North Korea. The President called on responsible nations to enforce and implement UN sanctions and impose their own measures. The ultimate goal is the complete denuclearization of North Korea. President Trump, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and President Moon of South Korea are meeting to discuss further actions in response to the North Korean issue.
