President Obama called President Karzai to discuss preparations for Afghanistan's upcoming elections, peace efforts, and the Bilateral Security Agreement. The President expressed support for a fair and credible election process and assured that the US will support Afghan security forces in securing the elections. The leaders emphasized the importance of independent Afghan electoral bodies in overseeing the transfer of power. President Karzai updated President Obama on peace and reconciliation efforts, with both leaders highlighting the need for regional countries to support a political solution. Regarding the Bilateral Security Agreement, President Obama informed President Karzai that the US is moving forward with contingency planning for an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year, given Karzai's reluctance to sign the agreement. However, if a willing and committed partner is found, a limited post-2014 mission focused on training, advising, and targeting core Al Qaeda could be considered. The US continues to support a sovereign, stable, unified, and democratic Afghanistan and remains committed to its partnership with Afghan security forces.
