President Biden has declared a major disaster in Alaska and authorized federal assistance to support recovery efforts after a severe winter storm and straight-line winds from January 1 to January 4, 2022. Federal funding will be available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding. Thomas J. Dargan has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, with potential additional designations based on further damage assessments.
