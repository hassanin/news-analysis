The article discusses the history of trilateral threat reduction cooperation at the former Semipalatinsk Test Site (STS) in Kazakhstan. From 1949 to 1989, the Soviet Union conducted numerous underground nuclear tests at STS. After Kazakhstan gained independence, it partnered with the US Department of Defense's Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to eliminate the Soviet nuclear test infrastructure and enhance nonproliferation efforts. In 2000, the DoD sealed 181 test tunnels and 13 test shafts at STS. However, evidence of scavenging activity and concerns about nuclear terrorism led to the conclusion that significant amounts of nuclear material were still present. Russia, Kazakhstan, and the United States collaborated to secure the remaining material. Over 40 tunnels were identified as posing a risk and were sealed with special cement, making the nuclear material inaccessible. The US also provided equipment and training to Kazakhstani security forces to deter intruders. In 2009, President Obama announced an international effort to secure all nuclear material, accelerating the STS project, which was completed almost two years ahead of schedule. The project cost an estimated total of $150 million over eight years.
