President Biden will be hosting the United We Stand Summit at the White House on September 15th to address the impact of hate-fueled violence on democracy and public safety. The summit aims to highlight the response of the Biden-Harris Administration and communities nationwide to these dangers, as well as present a shared, bipartisan vision for a more united America. The President decided to run for office after the violence in Charlottesville in 2017 and has since taken steps to counter hate-motivated violence. The summit will bring together leaders from various sectors, including survivors of hate-fueled violence, to discuss countering hate-fueled violence, preventing radicalization, and fostering unity. The event will also be open to communities across the country to watch live and engage in a national conversation about standing together against hate-fueled violence. Additionally, the White House is inviting nominations for extraordinary "Uniters" in communities who work to prevent acts of hate-fueled violence, promote healing, and foster unity.
