The Trump administration has created the first-ever National Workforce Strategy to create jobs for American workers and ensure economic expansion. To respond to the needs of business and workers, the administration formed the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, which is currently working on recommendations to promote various pathways to good careers, increase skills-based hiring, and encourage employer-led training. The Pledge to America's Workers, a core component of the strategy, has already seen success with over 280 companies and organizations pledging nearly 10 million enhanced training and career opportunities for American students and workers over the next five years. The goal is to benefit all Americans through the country's economic success.
