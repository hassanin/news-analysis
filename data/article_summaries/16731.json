The White House has announced two new actions to support working Americans. The Department of Labor is finalizing a rule that will require employees of federal contractors to earn up to seven paid sick days per year. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is also publishing its final collection of summary pay data by gender, race, and ethnicity to improve enforcement of equal pay laws. These actions aim to address the lack of access to paid sick leave and the gender pay gap that still exist in the United States. The article also highlights the progress that has been made in increasing access to paid sick leave and reducing the gender pay gap, but acknowledges that more work needs to be done.
