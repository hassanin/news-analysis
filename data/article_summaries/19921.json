The President highlights the impact of sanctions on Iran's economy and the opening for diplomacy with the election of a new Iranian President. He mentions the personal conversations he had with President Rouhani and the intensive diplomacy with Iran and other countries. The agreement achieved substantial limitations on Iran's nuclear program, halting its progress and preventing it from using certain enrichment methods. The President emphasizes that this agreement creates time and space for further negotiations to address comprehensive concerns about Iran's program. He also mentions that the US and its allies will provide Iran with modest relief from sanctions while continuing to enforce the broader architecture of sanctions.
