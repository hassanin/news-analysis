This article is a notice from the White House announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Cuba. The national emergency was initially declared in 1996 in response to the Cuban government's destruction of two unarmed US-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace. Since then, the national emergency has been expanded to deny monetary and material support to the Cuban government and modified based on disturbances or threatened disturbances of US international relations related to Cuba. The notice states that the Cuban government has not shown a commitment to refraining from excessive force against US vessels or aircraft engaged in memorial activities or peaceful protests north of Cuba. Unauthorized entry of US-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is seen as detrimental to US foreign policy as it could facilitate mass migration from Cuba, which would endanger US national security and disrupt international relations. As a result, the national emergency and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels are being continued. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
