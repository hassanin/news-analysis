This article discusses an executive order signed by President Biden to advance environmental justice in the United States. The order emphasizes the importance of clean air, clean water, safe food, and a healthy environment for all individuals. It calls for the implementation and enforcement of environmental and civil rights laws, pollution prevention, addressing climate change, and cleaning up legacy pollution. The order also highlights the need to invest in sustainable and resilient communities, prioritize equitable access to housing, energy, and transportation, and promote an inclusive and sustainable economy. It acknowledges the disproportionate burdens faced by communities with environmental justice concerns, often due to historical racial discrimination and segregation. The order requires each agency to integrate environmental justice into its mission, identify and address disproportionate impacts, evaluate legal authorities to address environmental justice concerns, and promote meaningful engagement of affected communities. It also establishes an Environmental Justice Subcommittee and a White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council to coordinate efforts and develop strategic plans. The order further emphasizes the importance of research, data collection, and analysis to advance environmental justice, as well as community notification on toxic chemical releases. The White House Office of Environmental Justice is established to lead and coordinate environmental justice initiatives. The order also calls for the issuance of guidance and the submission of reports on the implementation of environmental justice efforts.
