President Obama issued a statement on the 40th anniversary of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), emphasizing the importance of the treaty in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. He highlighted the three pillars of the NPT: disarmament, nonproliferation, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The United States is working with Russia to reduce nuclear arsenals and is reviewing its nuclear posture. They also aim to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and negotiate a treaty to end the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. To prevent proliferation, the US plans to host a Nuclear Security Summit to secure vulnerable nuclear materials. They will also work with allies to strengthen the NPT and enforce rights and responsibilities. Lastly, they seek a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including an international fuel bank and strengthening the International Atomic Energy Agency. The United States reaffirms its commitment to strengthen the nonproliferation regime and work towards a world without nuclear weapons.
