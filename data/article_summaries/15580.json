In this statement from President Obama, he addresses two main topics: the Affordable Care Act and government surveillance programs. 

Regarding the Affordable Care Act, the President explains that if you already have insurance, you don't have to do anything because the law provides new benefits and protections. These include free preventive care, allowing young adults to stay on their parents' plans until age 26, and cost controls that ensure insurance companies spend a certain percentage of premiums on healthcare costs. The President also mentions that in California, insurers are already giving rebates to consumers. He emphasizes that the law is working and encourages people to sign up for quality, affordable care through the online marketplaces that will be available starting October 1st. 

On the topic of government surveillance, the President acknowledges the reports of secret surveillance of phones and the internet and assures Americans that the government is not listening to their phone calls or reading their emails. He explains that the programs are authorized by Congress and overseen by the FISA Court, and that they only collect metadata to identify potential leads in counterterrorism efforts. The President emphasizes the importance of striking a balance between national security and privacy, and welcomes the debate on this issue. He also defends the classification of these programs, as their disclosure could compromise their effectiveness in preventing terrorist acts.
