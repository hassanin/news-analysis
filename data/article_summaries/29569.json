Ireland's Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, is visiting President Donald Trump at the White House to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. This tradition of Irish prime ministers visiting the United States on this holiday started in 1952 when Ireland's ambassador sent President Harry Truman a box of shamrocks. The visit is an opportunity to reflect on the importance of Irish people and their descendants to American history. President Trump has declared March 2018 as Irish-American Heritage Month, recognizing the contributions of Irish immigrants and their descendants to the United States. The visit also aims to promote Ireland and deepen the country's connection to its American ally.
