President Biden has identified bolstering democratic governance as the defining challenge of our time, emphasizing that democracy is crucial for peace, prosperity, and human dignity. To strengthen democratic resilience and respect for human rights globally, the United States plans to invest approximately $9.5 billion from 2022 to 2024. The Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal, launched at the first Summit for Democracy, focuses on five key areas: advancing technology for democracy, supporting free media, fighting corruption, bolstering human rights and democratic reformers, and defending free and fair elections. Additionally, the United States is announcing up to $690 million in new funding for the Presidential Initiative, subject to the availability of appropriations. At home, the Biden-Harris Administration has made significant progress, including job creation, reducing unemployment, lowering prescription drug costs and health insurance premiums, investing in infrastructure, and addressing the climate crisis. They have also prioritized protecting the right to vote and civil rights.
