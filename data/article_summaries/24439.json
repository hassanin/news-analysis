The United States is encouraged by President Yanukovych's decision to pardon former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko and former Environment Minister Heorhiy Filipchuk in Ukraine. This is seen as a positive step towards addressing concerns about democracy and the rule of law in the country. However, more still needs to be done. The US is urging Ukrainian authorities to end all politically motivated prosecutions, implement comprehensive judicial reform, and fully implement recommendations from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) after the 2012 parliamentary elections. The United States strongly supports the Ukrainian people's aspirations for a democratic, prosperous, and European future, which can only be achieved through continued democratic reform and adherence to the rule of law. The US is dedicated to strengthening the bilateral relationship with Ukraine based on shared transatlantic values.
