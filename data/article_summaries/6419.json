Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, Anne Neuberger, met with the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) to discuss cybersecurity challenges, particularly the threat of ransomware. Neuberger emphasized the role of state and local governments in cybersecurity and the importance of attorneys general in legal actions to protect state networks and prosecute cybercrimes. She also outlined the Biden Administration's efforts to modernize cyber defenses, such as the recent executive order on cybersecurity and partnerships with the public and private sectors. Neuberger mentioned the Cybersecurity Industrial Control Systems Initiative and its pilot program to enhance cyber resilience in the electric sector, with plans to expand to other critical sectors. The Biden Administration's ransomware strategy includes disrupting ransomware infrastructure, holding countries accountable for harboring ransom actors, analyzing cryptocurrency transactions, and reviewing ransomware payment policies. Neuberger called for public-private partnership to combat ransomware and urged corporate leaders to implement cybersecurity measures.
