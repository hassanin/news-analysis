The Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment situation report, showing that in September, the US added 661,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 7.9%. Since the start of the pandemic, 52% of job losses have been recovered, with the US gaining over 11.4 million jobs. The recovery has been concentrated in low-earning industries, such as retail trade and leisure and hospitality, which employ a large portion of minorities and those without college degrees. Blue-collar workers in manufacturing and construction have also experienced strong recoveries. Wages for manufacturing production and nonsupervisory employees grew faster during President Trump's expansion period compared to former President Obama's. Unemployment rates have fallen for all minorities and historically disadvantaged Americans. The recovery has been historically unprecedented, with the unemployment rate falling by 6.8 percentage points in the past five months. The current recovery is 41 times faster than the recovery following the global oil crisis in the 1980s and 1990s.
