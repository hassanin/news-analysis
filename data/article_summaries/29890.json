The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its Employment Situation Report for June, showing that nonfarm payroll employment increased by 213,000 jobs, surpassing expectations. This marks the longest streak of positive monthly job numbers in the U.S. economy. Since President Trump took office, the economy has added over 3.2 million jobs. Significant job growth was seen in education and health services, professional and business services, and manufacturing. Goods-producing industries have also fared well, adding 876,000 jobs since the election. The unemployment rate increased due to more people entering the labor force and actively looking for jobs. The unemployment rate for Hispanics reached a new low of 4.6 percent. Labor force participation for prime-age workers increased, indicating a strong job market. The high number of labor force reentrants and job leavers suggests a healthy economy where people are gaining confidence in finding better job opportunities.
