President Obama commends Congress for passing tax credits to incentivize businesses to hire veterans. He emphasizes that no veteran should have to struggle to find employment after serving their country. The President had proposed these tax credits in August and is eager to sign them into law. However, he also emphasizes that this is just the beginning and urges Congress to pass the rest of his American Jobs Act to create more jobs and improve the financial situation of the middle class.
