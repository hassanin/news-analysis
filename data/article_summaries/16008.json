In this memorandum, President Barack Obama certifies the continuation of U.S. drug interdiction assistance to the government of Colombia. He states that the interdiction of aircraft involved in illicit drug trafficking in Colombia's airspace is necessary due to the significant threat it poses to the country's national security. The memorandum also highlights the importance of Colombia having appropriate procedures in place to minimize innocent loss of life during interdiction, including effective means to identify and warn aircraft before the use of force is employed. The Secretary of State is tasked with publishing this determination in the Federal Register and notifying Congress.
