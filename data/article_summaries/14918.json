President Obama met with President Santos of Colombia to discuss various bilateral, regional, and global issues. Obama congratulated Santos on his recent election and praised his domestic reform efforts and regional diplomatic outreach. The two presidents discussed security challenges in Colombia, with Obama reaffirming the United States' commitment to helping address these challenges and achieve a just and durable peace. Obama also commended Colombia's efforts against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), including a recent successful operation against FARC's military leader. The presidents also discussed deepening economic ties between the two countries for the benefit of workers and consumers. They directed their teams to launch the US-Colombia High-Level Partnership Dialogue, which will enhance cooperation in areas such as social and economic opportunities, democracy, human rights, climate change, energy, and culture and education. The initial round of this dialogue will take place when Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg visits Colombia later in the Fall and will involve representatives from both governments.
