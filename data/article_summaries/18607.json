The White House announced that Judge Justice Garland will be meeting with several senators next week as part of the process for his Supreme Court nomination. They also announced that President Obama will convene his National Security Council at the CIA Headquarters to review efforts to combat ISIL and promote peace in Syria. The President also urged Democrats to get out and vote and support Democratic candidates. The White House did not comment on specific names mentioned in the Panama Papers, but confirmed that they are working to ensure the safe release of U.S. citizens missing or taken hostage in Syria. United Health Care's decision to pull out of Obamacare in two states was noted, but the White House emphasized that coverage is still in demand and the decision of one issuer does not reflect the marketplace as a whole. The White House did not comment on Senator Sanders' visit to the Vatican or Malia Obama's activities on the trip. The administration expressed confidence in the legal standing of the inversions rule and emphasized the importance of closing tax loopholes. The week ahead includes the President attending meetings at the White House, hosting the White House Science Fair, convening the National Security Council at the CIA Headquarters, welcoming the Wounded Warrior Ride to the White House, and attending more meetings.
