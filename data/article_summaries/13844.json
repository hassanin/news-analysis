This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Sudan. The national emergency was initially declared in 1997 due to the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan, and was expanded in 2006 to address the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region. The notice states that the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan still pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and therefore, the national emergency must continue beyond November 3, 2016. The notice concludes by stating that the continuation of the national emergency will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
