President Biden has announced his intention to nominate Jerome Powell for a second term as Chair of the Federal Reserve and Dr. Lael Brainard as Vice Chair. The President praised Powell's leadership during challenging times, including the pandemic and attacks on the Fed's independence. Brainard, a leading macroeconomist, has played a key role in the Fed's efforts to support economic recovery. Both Powell and Brainard share the administration's focus on ensuring that economic growth benefits all workers and have prioritized addressing financial risks from climate change.
