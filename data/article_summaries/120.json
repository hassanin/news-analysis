In this article, President Joe Biden transmits an alternative plan for pay adjustments for civilian Federal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay systems in January 2022. He cites Title 5, United States Code, which authorizes him to implement alternative plans for pay adjustments under certain circumstances. President Biden has determined that for 2022, the across-the-board base pay increase will be 2.2 percent and locality pay increases will average 0.5 percent, resulting in an overall average increase of 2.7 percent for civilian Federal employees. He assures that this decision will not significantly impact the government's ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce. The pay adjustment will take effect on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2022. The letter is signed by Joseph R. Biden Jr.
