The United States stands in solidarity with the LGBT community and supports the principle that LGBT rights are human rights. The recent comments by Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, along with reports of torture, disappearances, and arbitrary detention in The Gambia, are deeply concerning. The United States took action in 2014 by ending trade preferences with The Gambia due to its crackdown on the LGBT community and human rights violations. The United States is reviewing additional actions to respond to the worsening situation and calls on the Gambian government and all governments to promote inclusivity, reject intolerance, and respect the universal rights and freedoms of all people.
