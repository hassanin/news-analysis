The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a report on the job and economic impact of the Recovery Act. The report finds that the Recovery Act has already created about 3 million jobs and has raised the level of GDP by 2.7 to 3.2 percent. It also states that for every government dollar invested in Recovery Act programs, private companies and others are co-investing with nearly three times as much outside investment. The report highlights the benefits of these co-investments, including jump-starting private investment, aligning economic incentives, and increasing overall support. Clean energy is one area that is generating a lot of outside investment leverage, with a federal contribution of $46 billion partnering with $107 billion to support over $150 billion in total investments in energy efficiency, renewable generation, research, and other areas. The report also mentions the impact of Recovery Act Build America Bonds, which have generated significant outside investment while saving state and local governments billions of dollars. The bonds have allowed municipalities to originate loans with 35 percent of the interest paid by the Federal government, attracting a variety of investors. The report provides examples of how Recovery Act funds have benefited different sectors, such as environmental cleanup and preservation, building construction, and clean energy projects. It also includes a case study on the Section 1603 Energy Cash Assistance Program, showing that wind capacity additions in 2009 would have been significantly lower without the Recovery Act and other incentives.
