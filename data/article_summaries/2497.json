On July 22, 2021, the President signed into law H.R. 1652, also known as the "VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act of 2021." This law mandates that funds collected from deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements must be deposited into the Crime Victims Fund. It also increases the crime victim compensation formula grant, ensuring eligible programs receive 75 percent of the amounts awarded in the previous year. Furthermore, the law permits states to waive the requirement for programs to promote victim cooperation with law enforcement, and it allows or requires states to waive matching requirements for grant funds under certain circumstances.
