The United States welcomes the recent ratifications of the 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM/A), which will bring this treaty into force once countries deposit their instrument of ratification with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This treaty strengthens the existing international legal framework for nuclear security by imposing requirements for the physical protection of nuclear material for peaceful purposes. It aims to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction or sabotaging nuclear facilities. The amendment will enter into force once two-thirds of the 153 states party to the CPPNM deposit their instruments of ratification with the IAEA. As of April 1, 2016, 102 states have deposited their instrument of ratification, and two additional states are required for the amendment to enter into force. The United States has emphasized the importance of ratification and is offering assistance to achieve universalization of the Amended Convention.
