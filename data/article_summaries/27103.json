President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited the Vatican and met with Pope Francis and Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin. They discussed working together to combat terrorism and how religious communities can help in crisis regions like Syria, Libya, and ISIS-controlled territory. The President also announced over $300 million in anti-famine spending focused on Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, and Nigeria. As a gift, President Trump presented a first-edition set of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s writings to the Pope. The President and First Lady also toured the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Basilica. Italy was the third stop on President Trump's international trip, with the next stops being Brussels, Belgium for the NATO Summit and Taormina, Italy for the G7 Summit.
