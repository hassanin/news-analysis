President Trump recently hosted the second "Made in America" product showcase at the White House. The event aimed to celebrate American workers and invited companies from all 50 states to participate. To be considered "Made in USA," a product must be "all or virtually all" made in the United States, meaning that all significant parts and processing must originate from the country. President Trump emphasized the importance of American-made products and expressed his desire to bring back the era when everything had a "Made in America" label. The showcase featured various products from different states, highlighting the diversity and quality of American-made goods.
