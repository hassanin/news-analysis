Russia is resorting to horrific attacks on the Ukrainian people, damaging energy grid infrastructure as winter approaches. These strikes are not aimed at military targets but instead aim to increase the suffering and death of Ukrainian civilians. This also poses a risk of a nuclear safety incident that could affect the entire region. In response, the United States and its allies are providing Ukraine with support, including $400 million in security assistance and $1.5 billion in humanitarian aid. Russia underestimates the strength and resolve of the Ukrainian people, and its attempts to demoralize them will fail.
