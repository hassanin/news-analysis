The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet outlining the second phase of the 'Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership' (IMCP). The IMCP is an initiative led by the White House and the U.S. Department of Commerce that aims to encourage American communities to become globally competitive manufacturing hubs. In the first phase, 44 communities were awarded $7 million to support the creation of economic development strategies. The second phase will allow up to 12 communities to compete for a special designation as a "Manufacturing Community" and have elevated consideration for $1.3 billion in federal dollars and assistance from 10 cabinet departments/agencies. These communities will need to present strategies that identify future competitive technologies or industries and make investments in workforce and training, advanced research, infrastructure and site development, supply chain support, export promotion, and capital access. The IMCP is part of the Department of Commerce's "Open for Business Agenda" and aims to prioritize trade and investment. The application process for Phase 2 is now open, with a deadline of March 14, 2014.
