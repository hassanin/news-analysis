President Obama has signed an Executive Order acknowledging Liberia's progress since the end of its civil war in 2003, particularly in terms of democracy and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions. The United States congratulates Liberia for its determination and commitment to peace and democracy. Consequently, the President has terminated the national emergency declared in relation to Liberia and lifted the economic sanctions imposed on the country. Liberia has faced challenges such as recovering from the scars of war and dealing with the Ebola outbreak while working towards consolidating democracy, improving the economy, investing in infrastructure, and strengthening security services. There is still much work to be done, including the transfer of security responsibility to the U.N. Mission in Liberia in July 2016 and presidential elections in 2017. The United States and international partners will continue to support Liberia as it faces these challenges and fulfills its potential. This announcement is just one of many steps towards Liberia's future progress.
