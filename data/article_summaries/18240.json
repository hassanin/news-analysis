The United States and Indonesia are collaborating on various maritime initiatives to advance their shared maritime security interests, protect oceans, and promote sustainable development in the marine sector. The initiatives include:

1. Protecting Coastal Communities and Fisheries: The United States will provide substantial assistance to support the conservation of marine biodiversity, sustainable fisheries management, and improved governance of marine resources in Indonesia.

2. Combatting Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing: The United States and Indonesia are working together to combat and deter illegal fishing in Indonesian waters and the broader ASEAN region. This includes providing assistance in terms of technology, capacity building, and training related to fisheries enforcement and intelligence analysis.

3. Expanding Marine Science & Technology Collaboration: The United States and Indonesia are collaborating on joint observation and research on marine ecosystems, including oceanographic and climate variability research. This collaboration aims to improve understanding of ocean-atmosphere interactions, climate change, and ecosystem responses.

4. Improving Security at Sea and Ports: The United States is providing training courses to the Indonesian Coast Guard and conducting capacity building for compliance with international port security standards. The goal is to detect and deter security threats in the maritime transport sector.

5. Promoting Environmentally-Sustainable Economic Growth: The United States and Indonesia are exploring trade and investment activities in the maritime sector and supporting the sustainable development of Indonesia's fisheries and ports. This includes promoting the use of sustainable catch methods by seafood businesses operating in Indonesia.

6. Assisting Victims of Forced Labor within the Seafood Industry: The United States contributes emergency victim assistance funds to support efforts by Indonesia and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to rescue victims of forced labor in the fishing industry. The United States also encourages the Indonesian government to develop procedures to identify and care for victims, as well as prosecute those involved in their exploitation.

7. Assisting and Protecting Irregular Migrant Movements: In response to the maritime migrant crisis in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea in 2015, the United States provided emergency funds to support vulnerable migrants in Indonesia and other countries in the region. This support includes temporary shelter, health and nutrition support, and addressing root causes of irregular migration.

Overall, the U.S.-Indonesia maritime cooperation aims to address various challenges such as illegal fishing, climate change, and forced labor while promoting sustainable development and security in the maritime sector.
