In this article, President Donald Trump discusses the actions his administration has taken to address the opioid crisis in the United States. Since taking office, they have declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency and secured $6 billion in funding to combat it. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided additional emergency grant funding to healthcare providers treating individuals with substance use disorders. The administration has also eased regulatory burdens to ensure greater access to addiction support services through telehealth options. The Safer Prescribing Plan was launched to reduce overprescribing of opioids, which has resulted in a 31 percent decrease in opioid prescriptions since Trump took office. Efforts have been made to educate young adults about the dangers of misusing opioids, and law enforcement is working to prevent the illegal importation and distribution of opioids. The administration has championed evidence-based treatments and provided recovery support resources. They have also awarded planning grants to increase the capacity of Medicaid providers to deliver substance use disorder treatment. Overall, Trump emphasizes the importance of raising awareness, supporting those struggling with addiction, and working towards a healthier and safer society.
