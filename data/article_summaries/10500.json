The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) became law twenty years ago, providing protection for workers who needed time off to care for themselves or their family members. Before the FMLA, taking time off for caregiving could have resulted in job loss or career setbacks, particularly for women who faced discrimination in the workplace. The law aimed to level the playing field by extending protections to both women and men. Over the years, the FMLA has been expanded to include protections for military families and airline workers. However, not all employees are covered by the law, and many workers cannot afford to take unpaid leave. As the FMLA marks its twentieth anniversary, there is still work to be done in creating fairer workplaces and supporting healthier, more secure families.
