The article is a memorandum by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2023. The memorandum identifies Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries. The inclusion of a country on the list is based on geographic, commercial, and economic factors that contribute to drug transit or production, regardless of the government's counterdrug efforts or cooperation with the United States. Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela are specifically designated as having failed to make substantial efforts to adhere to international counternarcotics agreements and take the required measures. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of addressing the drug addiction and overdose epidemic in the United States and outlines the Administration's National Drug Control Strategy and budget request for Fiscal Year 2023. It also highlights the commitment to working with neighboring countries and partners to tackle drug production, trafficking, and narcotics-related corruption, particularly in relation to synthetic drugs. The memorandum concludes by authorizing the submission of the designation and justifications to Congress and the publication of the determination in the Federal Register.
