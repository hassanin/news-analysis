On November 14, 1994, President Trump declared a national emergency regarding the threat of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and their means of delivery. This declaration was further amended on July 28, 1998, and June 28, 2005, to better combat the worldwide proliferation of such weapons. The President states that the threat of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States' national security, foreign policy, and economy. Therefore, he is extending the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938 for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and sent to Congress.
