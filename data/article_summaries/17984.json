President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13159 regarding the risk of nuclear proliferation from Russian highly enriched uranium will continue beyond June 21, 2010. The United States aims to ensure that fissile material from Russian nuclear weapons is used for peaceful purposes and protected from diversion to activities of proliferation concern. The accumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in Russia poses an ongoing threat to national security and foreign policy. Therefore, the President has determined it is necessary to maintain the national emergency and emergency authorities to address this threat.
