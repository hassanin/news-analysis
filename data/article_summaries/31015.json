The United States is aiming to regain its leadership in space exploration, according to Vice President Mike Pence. He has revived the National Space Council, which will hold its first meeting in 25 years, to develop and implement long-term strategic goals for the country's space policy. Pence outlined three main objectives for the council: refocusing the space program on human exploration and discovery, establishing a renewed American presence on the Moon, and eventually sending humans to Mars; renewing the commitment to space technology for national security purposes; and promoting regulatory, technological, and educational reforms to expand economic opportunities in outer space. To achieve these goals, the council will seek input from leaders in the commercial-space industry.
