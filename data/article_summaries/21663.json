The Department of Agriculture and the Department of Justice have reached a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the Keepseagle class action lawsuit. This lawsuit was filed in 1999 by Native American farmers who claimed discrimination in accessing and participating in USDA's farm loan programs. The settlement is seen as an important step in addressing USDA's history of civil rights issues. President Obama commended Secretary Vilsack and Attorney General Holder for their efforts in reaching this agreement, emphasizing the government's commitment to treating all citizens fairly. The President also called on Congress to implement settlements in other discrimination cases, such as the Pigford II lawsuit filed by African American farmers and the Cobell lawsuit filed by Native Americans over the management of Indian trust accounts and resources. The administration is also working towards resolving claims made by women and Hispanic farmers against the USDA.
