On July 12, 2013, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 1151, which concerns Taiwan's participation in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The United States fully supports Taiwan's membership in international organizations that do not require statehood for participation and encourages their meaningful involvement. The Obama Administration has publicly supported Taiwan's participation in the ICAO and will continue to do so. However, the Act contains sections that direct the Secretary of State to undertake certain diplomatic initiatives and report to Congress, which the President believes interferes with his constitutional authority. Therefore, the Administration will interpret and implement these sections in a manner that does not interfere with the President's authority to conduct diplomacy and protect the confidentiality of diplomatic communications. The President also notes that his Administration will construe the Act to be consistent with the "one China" policy of the United States.
