This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama regarding the boundary enlargement of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument. The monument was originally established by President Bill Clinton in 2000 to protect the ecological wonders and biological diversity of the Cascade, Klamath, and Siskiyou ecoregions. The expansion of the monument includes areas such as Horseshoe Ranch, the Jenny Creek watershed, the Grizzly Peak area, Lost Lake, the Rogue Valley foothills, the Southern Cascades area, and the area surrounding Surveyor Mountain. The purpose of the expansion is to create vital habitat connectivity, watershed protection, and landscape-scale resilience for the area's natural resources. The proclamation highlights the diverse plant and animal species found in the area, as well as the historic and cultural significance of the landscape. The expansion area will be managed by the Bureau of Land Management as part of the National Landscape Conservation System.
