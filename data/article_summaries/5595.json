Twelve years ago, President Obama and the author were working on economic legislation, including the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which aimed to give women a fair chance in the workplace. However, the author acknowledges that there is still a long way to go in achieving full fair pay, especially for women of color. The pandemic has further widened income and wealth gaps for women, with many dropping out of the labor force due to increased domestic responsibilities. The author, along with Vice President Harris, plans to lead an economic recovery that addresses these issues and breaks down barriers for women. They support the Paycheck Fairness Act, which aims to end pay discrimination and increase transparency. Additional steps such as paid family and medical leave, affordable childcare, and training pipelines into high-paying jobs are also needed. The author urges employers to take immediate action to change discriminatory pay practices. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that women are valued and given the fair opportunities they deserve.
