President Biden's Investing in America agenda aims to lower energy costs, improve housing quality, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions for hard-working families in the United States. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is taking new actions to incorporate climate risk and mitigation into federally-supported housing. These actions will help families save money on energy costs and maintain comfortable living conditions, especially in the face of extreme temperatures and volatile weather caused by climate change. They will also contribute to the fight against the climate crisis by reducing pollution from buildings.

The steps being taken will provide additional support for low- and moderate-income families and align with the Inflation Reduction Act, which offers tax credits for the installation of energy-saving equipment and building upgrades. These initiatives are part of President Biden's broader goal to retrofit four million buildings and two million homes during his first term.

The actions announced today are in line with President Biden's commitment to environmental justice for all, as stated in his Executive Order on Revitalizing Our Nation's Commitment to Environmental Justice. They aim to reduce energy burden, lower emissions, and enhance climate resilience, particularly for communities facing disproportionate climate risks such as flooding, fires, and extreme temperatures. It is worth noting that the energy burden for low-income households is on average three times higher than that of non-low-income households.

These announcements follow a recent gathering at the White House where 24 states showcased their efforts in commercial and residential building decarbonization policies and programs. These initiatives aim to lower utility bills, enhance climate resilience, and decrease emissions.
