President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring the week of August 7-13, 2011, as National Health Center Week. The proclamation highlights the importance of community health centers in providing medical checkups, education, advice, and critical services to over 19 million Americans. These centers play a critical role in the healthcare system by providing high-quality services at an affordable cost and improving the quality of life for their patients. The proclamation also acknowledges the positive impact of community health centers on reducing unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits. The Obama administration has been committed to supporting these centers through funding for technology and infrastructure updates, as well as the construction of new centers. The Affordable Care Act has also introduced initiatives to benefit all Americans, including the Health Centers Advanced Primary Care Practice demonstration project. The proclamation encourages Americans to celebrate National Health Center Week by visiting their local community health centers and exploring the programs they offer.
