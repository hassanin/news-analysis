The Biden-Harris Administration met with suppliers to discuss the manufacturing, distribution, and accessibility of RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) immunizations through the private market. They emphasized the need for manufacturers like Sanofi and AstraZeneca to work urgently to meet demand as winter approaches. The meeting also involved planning for next year's projected demand for immunizations. In previous meetings, manufacturers committed to producing additional RSV immunizations for infants, and all the additional doses have been released. The administration is focused on ensuring access to safe and effective vaccines, including RSV, flu, and COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for vulnerable communities like infants. The CDC's Vaccines for Children program plays a significant role in providing vaccines to half of America's children.
