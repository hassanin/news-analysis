President Barack Obama has proclaimed March 17 to March 23, 2013, as National Poison Prevention Week in the United States. The proclamation highlights the importance of taking steps to protect ourselves and our loved ones from accidental poisoning. While childhood death rates from accidental poisoning have decreased, there is still work to be done. Parents and caregivers are encouraged to store medicine and hazardous products out of children's reach and remove unused or expired medications from their homes. The National Poison Help Line is available for anyone who believes a child or loved one has been poisoned. The proclamation also emphasizes the dangers of prescription drug overdoses and encourages correct usage, storage, and disposal of medications. Americans are urged to learn more about the dangers of accidental poisonings and to take preventative measures.
