President Obama spoke with Australian Prime Minister Abbott to discuss Malaysia Airlines flight 17. They both expressed the need for a prompt, full, unimpeded, and transparent international investigation. Australia has shown leadership by sending investigators to the crash site and offering federal police assistance if needed. The two leaders are determined to ensure full, immediate, and secure access for international investigators to the site. The US will continue to support and coordinate closely with Australia on this issue, including at the United Nations Security Council.
