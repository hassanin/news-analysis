President Donald J. Trump has praised the House for passing the STOP School Violence Act of 2018 (H.R. 4909), which aims to enhance the safety of American students. The legislation authorizes State-based grants to support violence prevention programs that are backed by evidence. The President believes that it is crucial to strengthen laws to assist law enforcement, address the needs of individuals with serious mental illness, and implement proactive strategies to identify and prevent violence in schools. The Administration is satisfied with the progress made in securing schools recently and is eager to collaborate with the Senate to protect students in America.
