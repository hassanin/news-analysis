President Biden has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Yemen, which was declared in Executive Order 13611 in 2012, will continue beyond May 16, 2023. This decision is based on the ongoing threat posed by certain former members of the Yemeni government and others to Yemen's peace, security, and stability, which also affects the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
