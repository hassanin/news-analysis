In a call between President Obama and Chancellor Merkel of Germany, they discussed the situation in Ukraine, the P5+1 talks with Iran, and U.S.-German bilateral relations. They both agreed that Russia needs to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation in eastern Ukraine, including supporting a ceasefire, talks under the OSCE-mediated contact group, and establishing an OSCE border monitoring mechanism. They also called on Russia to release hostages and stop the flow of weapons and fighters to separatists. The leaders acknowledged that Russia has not fulfilled these actions so far. They reaffirmed their commitment to work with allies to impose costs on Russia and support Ukraine's stability and prosperity. On the P5+1 talks with Iran, they discussed the progress made but noted that important gaps still remain. They agreed that Iran needs to assure the international community that its nuclear program is peaceful. They also talked about U.S.-German intelligence cooperation and the need to improve it.
