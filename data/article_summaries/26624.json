First Lady Melania Trump has donated the couture gown she wore to the 2017 inaugural balls to the First Ladies Collection at the National Museum of American History. The dress, designed by Herve Pierre in collaboration with Mrs. Trump, is a vanilla silk crepe off-the-shoulder gown with a slit skirt and claret ribbon around the waist. Mrs. Trump stated that it was an honor to dedicate the dress to the exhibit and to memorialize the special evening and new chapter in her family's life. The fashion designer, Herve Pierre, expressed his gratitude for the collaboration and the opportunity to have the dress preserved in such an iconic exhibit. The First Ladies exhibition at the museum aims to highlight the changing role of the First Lady and American women over the past 200 years.
