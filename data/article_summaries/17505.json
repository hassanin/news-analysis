Vice President Biden met with first responders to thank them and discuss the new nationwide public safety broadband network. He also announced the release of a report from the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) on the economic benefits of increasing spectrum for wireless broadband. The report highlights the need for additional spectrum to accommodate the growing demand for wireless data traffic and the potential for wireless broadband to transform public safety and stimulate innovation in the economy. The report also addresses key issues related to spectrum policy, including the use of voluntary incentive auctions, the value of unlicensed spectrum, and the importance of federal funding for research and development in wireless technologies.
