President Obama released a statement on the passing of Minnie Minoso, referring to him as "Mr. White Sox." Minoso, the first black Major Leaguer in Chicago, came to the United States from Cuba and played in the Negro Leagues before integrating baseball in the 1950s. Despite facing racial slurs and discrimination, he became a dominant player, earning multiple All-Star appearances and Gold Gloves. Although Minoso was not inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame during his lifetime, his story is seen as an embodiment of the American spirit for many black and Latino young people. President Obama expressed his condolences to Minoso's family and fans in Chicago, Cleveland, and around the world.
