The article discusses the need to update the current immigration system in the United States. The authors argue that the current laws are outdated and do not meet the needs of the economy. They propose the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy Act, which would create a skills-based points system similar to those used in Canada and Australia. This system would attract highly skilled immigrants and limit the number of low-skilled workers. The authors believe that this would encourage employers to hire, train, and pay more to American workers. The legislation would also prioritize immediate family unification and eliminate the diversity visa lottery. The authors argue that these changes would be pro-worker, pro-growth, and proven to work. They claim that these changes have widespread public support and would ultimately reduce annual immigration levels by half after ten years. The authors believe that updating the immigration laws is necessary to raise wages, create jobs, give immigrants opportunities for upward mobility, and make America more competitive in the 21st century.
