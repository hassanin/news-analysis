The President signed into law the "Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act" on December 23, 2021. This law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish grant programs, a public-private partnership, and an action plan to study amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases, including investigational drugs. Representatives Quigley and Fortenberry, as well as Senators Coons and Murkowski, were recognized for their leadership in this effort.
