The White House has announced an effort to advance offshore wind energy development in California, aiming to create thousands of good-paying, union jobs and deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The Department of the Interior, in coordination with the Department of Defense, has identified the Morro Bay 399 Area and the Humboldt Call Area as potential sites for offshore wind projects. These areas could bring up to 4.6 gigawatts of clean energy to the grid, enough to power 1.6 million homes. The Defense Department played a critical role in identifying these areas, considering the importance of military testing and operations off the coast of California. Floating offshore wind technology will be deployed due to the deeper waters in the Pacific. The Department of Energy has also invested over $100 million in researching floating offshore wind technology. This announcement follows the Biden Administration's commitment to offshore wind energy and the approval of the Vineyard Wind project in Massachusetts.
