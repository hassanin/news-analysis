President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Indiana due to severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes that occurred from March 31 to April 1, 2023. This declaration allows federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in twelve counties. Assistance may include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Brian F. Schiller of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are still ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website, by calling FEMA, or by using the FEMA App. For more information, the FEMA News Desk can be contacted.
