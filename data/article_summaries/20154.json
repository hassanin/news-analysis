This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on June 5, 2009, regarding the suspension of limitations under the Jerusalem Embassy Act. The Act, passed in 1995, aimed to move the United States embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, President Obama determined that it was necessary to suspend the limitations set forth in sections 3(b) and 7(b) of the Act for a period of 6 months in order to protect the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary of State was directed to transmit this determination to Congress, accompanied by a report, and to publish the determination in the Federal Register.
