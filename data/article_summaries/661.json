President Joe Biden has issued a new Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2021. The determination states that there is an unforeseen emergency refugee situation due to political violence, repression, atrocities, and humanitarian crises in various countries, as well as changing conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The allocation of admissions among refugees of humanitarian concern set forth in a previous determination (PD 2021-02) is deemed insufficient to address this emergency situation. Therefore, the President has revised the allocations for FY 2021, with specific numbers allocated to different regions. The Secretary of State is authorized to use the unallocated reserve and transfer unused allocations as needed. The determination also specifies certain categories of persons who may be considered refugees for admission to the United States. The admission of up to 15,000 refugees is justified by humanitarian concerns and may be increased if necessary. The determination emphasizes that refugee resettlement should be consistent with the requirements of Executive Order 14013 on resettling refugees and planning for the impact of climate change on migration. Assistance to persons applying for admission to the U.S. as part of the overseas refugee admissions program is determined to be in the foreign policy interests of the United States. This determination supersedes a previous determination (PD 2021-02) issued on October 27, 2020.
