The President of the United States has declared that the national emergency with respect to Lebanon, which was declared in Executive Order 13441 on August 1, 2007, will continue beyond August 1, 2017. This decision is based on ongoing activities, such as the transfer of arms to Hizballah, which undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to instability in the region, and pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, it has been determined that the national emergency must continue.
