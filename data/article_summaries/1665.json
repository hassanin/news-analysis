The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment has dropped below 300,000 for the first time since the pandemic began. This is a decrease of over 60% since the current president took office, and it is the lowest weekly figure since March 14, 2020. The four-week average of unemployment claims has also declined, indicating progress. Additionally, wages are rising, and the unemployment rate is back below 5%, showing that the economy is returning to normal despite the challenges posed by the Delta variant. Vaccination requirements have led to more Americans getting vaccinated, with the number of eligible unvaccinated Americans decreasing from nearly 100 million in July to 66 million. This progress against the Delta variant, along with declining COVID-19 cases, demonstrates that America is experiencing a historic economic recovery. The first half of the year saw the fastest economic growth in four decades, and there has been a significant decrease in long-term unemployment. Job growth has also surpassed previous records under a new president, with an average of 600,000 new jobs created each month. To sustain this momentum, it is crucial to invest in the nation and its people by passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Build Back Better Act. These measures aim to strengthen the economy's foundations, revitalize the middle class, and ensure America's competitiveness in the long term.
