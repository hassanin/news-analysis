In this article, President Trump discusses the possibility of implementing a total quarantine for New York City in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He mentions that states without a high number of infections have asked him to consider it. The quarantine would be for a short period of time and would include parts of Connecticut and New Jersey as well. However, he states that he does not plan to close down the subway, bridges, or tunnels. President Trump also mentions that the money allocated for relief efforts will be overseen by a committee and defends the unanimous vote in support of the relief package, questioning why Democrats would criticize him after voting for it.
