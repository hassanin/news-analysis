On June 23, 2010, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13545, which amended Executive Order 13265 from 2002 to establish the "President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition." The purpose of this council is to develop and coordinate a national program to enhance physical activity, fitness, sports participation, and good nutrition. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Education, is responsible for implementing this program. The council, composed of up to 25 members appointed by the President, advises the President and the Secretary on progress made and recommends actions to accelerate progress. It also functions as a liaison to relevant state, local, and private entities to improve physical activity, fitness, sports, and nutrition programs and services. The executive order provides administrative details, such as compensation, staff, and subcommittees, and states that the council will terminate after two years unless extended by the President.
