The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) released a report assessing the Obama Administration's preparations for the expected resurgence of the H1N1 flu in the fall of 2009. The report praised the Federal Government's well-organized and scientifically grounded preparations, but also highlighted areas that could be improved or accelerated. The report recommended accelerating the preparation of flu vaccines, clarifying guidelines for the use of antiviral medicines, upgrading the system for tracking the pandemic's progress, developing communication strategies to broadcast public health messages, and identifying a White House point person to coordinate key decisions. The report also emphasized the importance of individual behavior in mitigating the severity of the flu season, such as frequent hand-washing and staying home when sick. The Administration officials leading the flu response efforts welcomed the report and its recommendations.
