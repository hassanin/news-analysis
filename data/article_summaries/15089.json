President Obama has asked Congress to consider providing approximately $1.9 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations to respond to the Zika virus. The funding would be used to prevent the spread of the virus, support research for vaccines and therapies, provide assistance to affected states and territories, and help affected countries combat mosquitoes and support affected populations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 50 laboratory-confirmed cases of the Zika virus among U.S. travelers, and the World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The President's priority is to protect the health and safety of Americans, and he urges Congress to act quickly on this request.
