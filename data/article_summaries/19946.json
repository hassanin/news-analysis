On March 20, 2015, President Obama will host the second annual White House Student Film Festival. The festival is an opportunity for K-12 students to produce short films on the theme of service and helping your community. This year's event will showcase 15 students' visions on the theme "The Impact of Giving Back." The festival aims to highlight the promise of mentorship in the arts and calls for the entertainment industry to build upon their mentoring programs. The President will discuss the progress of his My Brother's Keeper initiative, which aims to close opportunity gaps faced by young people, particularly boys and young men of color. The selected student videos will be screened at the White House and the filmmakers will attend a reception in their honor. Additionally, there will be a second day of programming at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., where the student filmmakers will participate in educational workshops. The event will be open press and streamed live on obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/live. Media registration is required to cover the event.
