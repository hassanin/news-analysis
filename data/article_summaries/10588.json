In this article, President Barack Obama discusses the discovery of unethical research conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948. The research involved intentionally infecting vulnerable populations with sexually transmitted diseases. In response to this revelation, Obama requests a thorough review of human subjects protection to ensure that current regulations adequately protect participants in scientific studies supported by the Federal Government. He asks Dr. Amy Gutmann, Chair of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, to convene a panel to conduct this review and also investigate the specifics of the U.S. Public Health Service study. The Commission is expected to seek the insights of international experts, consult with counterparts in the global community, and complete its work within 9 months. Obama emphasizes the importance of using the Commission's expertise in science, policy, ethics, and religious values to carry out this mission, as it is necessary to prevent future abuses and protect the well-being of research participants.
