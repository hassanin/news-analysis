In this op-ed, First Lady Michelle Obama discusses the importance of education for girls around the world. She shares her personal connection to the issue, emphasizing how education empowered her and opened doors for her. She also mentions her encounter with Malala Yousafzai, who was shot for wanting to go to school, which further motivated her to work on global girls' education. Despite not having her own budget or authority to pass laws, Obama highlights the progress made through partnerships with companies and organizations, as well as collaborations with countries and investments in Let Girls Learn programs. She mentions the CNN film "We Will Rise," which tells the stories of girls in Liberia and Morocco who face barriers to education. These girls come from impoverished families and deal with challenges like dangerous commutes and cultural pressures. However, they remain determined to fulfill their dreams and work hard to get an education. Obama urges readers to visit LetGirlsLearn.Gov to learn how they can take action to support girls' education worldwide.
