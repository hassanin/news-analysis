The White House has announced that it is taking steps to normalize relations with Cuba and bring consistency to its immigration policy. As part of these changes, the Department of Homeland Security is ending the "wet-foot/dry foot" policy, which allowed Cuban nationals who reached US soil to stay and become eligible for residency after one year. Cuban nationals who attempt to enter the US illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief will now be subject to removal, in line with US law and enforcement priorities. The Cuban government has agreed to accept the return of Cuban nationals who have been ordered removed. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security is ending the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, which provided preferential treatment to Cuban medical personnel. Cuban medical personnel will now be eligible to apply for asylum at US embassies and consulates around the world, following the procedures for all foreign nationals. The US will continue to welcome Cubans as it does immigrants from other nations, in accordance with its laws. The Obama administration has worked to improve the lives of the Cuban people by providing them with greater access to resources, information, and connectivity to the wider world, and believes that sustaining this approach is the best way to ensure that Cubans can enjoy prosperity, pursue reforms, and determine their own destiny.
