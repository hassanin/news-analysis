The article is about American Heart Month, which aims to raise awareness about heart disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in America, claiming more lives than all forms of cancer combined. Certain risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, and diabetes, contribute to heart disease. The article emphasizes the importance of adopting healthy habits, including eating a heart-healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding tobacco. Only 3% of U.S. adults practice all of these habits, so there is a need to increase awareness and encourage more people to adopt them. The article also highlights the higher risk of heart disease in women and the need for them to take heart health seriously. The Heart Truth campaign, which promotes heart disease awareness among women, organizes National Wear Red Day on the first Friday of February. Everyone is encouraged to wear red or the Red Dress Pin to show support for heart disease awareness. The article concludes by honoring health professionals, researchers, and other heart health ambassadors for their efforts in promoting heart health. The President has proclaimed February as American Heart Month and invites all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day.
