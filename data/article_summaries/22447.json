President Obama is commending the National Endowment for Democracy's 2009 Democracy Award recipients, including Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia, Librado Linares, Ivan Hernandez Carrillo, and Iris Tamara Perez Aguilera. He also acknowledges the bravery of all those who are fighting for the Cuban people's right to determine their country's future. Four of the recipients have been unjustly jailed for defending basic freedoms, and President Obama hopes that all political prisoners, including three of the award recipients, will be released and allowed to participate in a democratic future in Cuba.
