President Biden is visiting Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he will highlight how his economic policies are driving a boom in Black-owned small businesses. Black business ownership is growing at its fastest pace in 30 years. The President will announce new investments in Milwaukee and across the country as part of his Investing in America agenda. These investments will fund infrastructure projects, improve roads and bridges, provide clean water, and create good-paying jobs. Before his remarks, President Biden will make a brief stop at Hero Plumbing, a Black-owned small business that is removing lead pipes in Milwaukee. This effort aligns with the President's commitment to remove all lead service lines in the nation by the end of the decade. The funding for this goal comes from the President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which many Republicans, including Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, voted against. The administration will continue to make historic investments to support small businesses, including Black-owned businesses, in Wisconsin and beyond.
