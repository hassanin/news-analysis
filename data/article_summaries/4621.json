Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 60 days ago, the Biden-Harris Administration has been actively working to implement the largest long-term investment in America's infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. The law aims to rebuild roads and bridges, replace lead pipes, provide high-speed internet to all American families, and create jobs. The Administration is committed to ensuring that these investments promote equity and racial justice, reach all communities across the country, and strengthen resilience to climate change.

To achieve these goals, President Biden appointed Mitch Landrieu as Senior Adviser and Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator and established an Infrastructure Implementation Task Force through an Executive Order. The Administration launched Build.gov as a resource hub for implementation and embarked on a nationwide tour to highlight the benefits of the law.

During the tour, President Biden surveyed a bridge in need of repairs in New Hampshire, toured an electric vehicle plant in Michigan, and visited a public transit authority in Missouri. Vice President Harris joined Transportation Secretary Buttigieg in North Carolina to tour an electric bus facility, while other members of the Administration, such as the EPA Administrator and Interior Secretary, traveled across the country to discuss resilience projects and clean energy initiatives.

The Administration's focus is on delivering results to the American people while promoting racial equity, combating climate change, and creating job opportunities for American workers. The key areas of focus include roads, bridges, and transportation infrastructure; water infrastructure; high-speed internet; and clean energy and environmental remediation.
