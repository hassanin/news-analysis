President Biden and King Charles III of the United Kingdom met with philanthropists and financiers at Windsor Castle to discuss financing for emerging markets and developing countries in addressing the climate crisis. The meeting followed the Climate Finance Mobilization Forum, which aimed to mobilize private investment for clean and renewable energy, emissions reduction, forest restoration, and climate resilience. The gathering emphasized the importance of partnership among governments, philanthropies, and investors, as the scale of the transition requires trillions in private investment. Various financial institutions and philanthropists announced new investment platforms and initiatives to support climate efforts in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The United Arab Emirates, as the COP28 President Designate, will host a High-Level Business & Philanthropy Delivery Forum during the World Leaders Climate Action Summit to further collaboration and progress.
