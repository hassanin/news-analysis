The memorandum is a directive from President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to extend and expand eligibility for Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for certain residents of Hong Kong who are currently in the United States. This decision is based on the United States' support for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, which have been eroded by the actions of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The PRC imposed the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (NSL) in June 2020, undermining the rights and freedoms protected under the Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The PRC has also limited academic freedom, cracked down on freedom of the press, and detained opposition politicians, activists, and protesters. The extension and expansion of DED is seen as a way to offer a safe haven for Hong Kong residents who have been deprived of their freedoms and to further United States interests in the region. The memorandum provides specific criteria for eligibility and excludes individuals who have returned to Hong Kong, those who have not continuously resided in the United States, and those who are inadmissible or deportable under immigration laws, among others. The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to authorize employment for noncitizens whose removal has been deferred and to consider suspending regulatory requirements for F-1 nonimmigrant students from Hong Kong.
