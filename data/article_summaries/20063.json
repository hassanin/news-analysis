The White House has announced an FY2017 Department of Defense funding request of $3.4 billion for the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI). This represents a significant increase from last year's funding level and aims to ensure peace and security in Europe. The United States has been increasing military activities in Eastern and Central Europe over the past two years to reassure allies and partners of its commitment to their security. The ERI funding provides for a persistent rotational presence of U.S. air, land, and sea forces in the region. The request for 2016 of nearly $800 million was fully supported by Congress and focused on assurance activities and building the resilience and capability of allies and partners. The FY2017 ERI request aims to expand and deepen activities in five areas: increasing presence, conducting more exercises and training, enhancing prepositioning of equipment, improving infrastructure, and building the capacity of allies and partners. The funding will also enable a quicker and more robust response in support of NATO's common defense.
