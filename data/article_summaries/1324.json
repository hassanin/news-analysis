The United States and Mexico are celebrating 200 years of bilateral relations and the first anniversary of the U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities. The framework aims to address shared security challenges such as human trafficking, violence, illicit firearms, substance use disorder, and illicit drugs. Both countries are committed to upholding the rule of law, protecting human rights, and fighting corruption. They have set ambitious goals and developed action plans to achieve them. In the first year of the framework, efforts were made to reduce substance use disorder and its associated harm, with the United States investing billions in drug treatment and interdiction. Education campaigns were launched on the dangers of drugs, and Mexico's National Strategy to Prevent Addictions reached millions of people. Forensic capacity was improved to identify victims of forced disappearance, and law enforcement and justice services for gender-based violence victims were strengthened. Both countries worked together to prevent transnational criminal organizations from harming their countries, implementing mirrored patrols along the shared border and disrupting narcotics and firearms trafficking, as well as human smuggling. Law enforcement cooperation and information sharing supported drug interdiction activities, with significant seizures of fentanyl in both countries. Efforts were made to curb firearms trafficking, resulting in more criminal referrals and seizures of firearms. Criminal networks were pursued through crackdowns on money laundering networks and extraditions. Both countries aim to protect their people, prevent transborder crime, and pursue criminal networks in the coming year.
