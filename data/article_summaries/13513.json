President Obama has declared a major disaster in the U.S. Virgin Islands and ordered federal aid to supplement the territory's efforts in the aftermath of severe storms, flooding, mudslides, and landslides caused by Tropical Storm Otto. The declaration allows federal funding for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures on the islands of St. Croix, St. John, St. Thomas, and Water Island. Philip E. Parr has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, and additional designations may be made based on further damage assessments.
