According to the article, the economy under President Biden has added over 200,000 jobs last month, totaling 13.2 million jobs since he took office. This is more jobs added in two and a half years than any president has created in a four-year term. The unemployment rate has remained below 4 percent for 17 consecutive months, the longest stretch since the 1960s. The percentage of working-age Americans with jobs is at its highest level in over 20 years. Inflation has decreased by more than half, and there is stable and steady economic growth. This is seen as a result of Bidenomics, which focuses on creating jobs, lowering costs for families, and making smart investments in America.
