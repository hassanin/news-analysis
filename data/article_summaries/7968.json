The United States, along with its allies and partners, is imposing sanctions on additional Russian elites and their family members who continue to support President Putin despite the invasion of Ukraine. These individuals have benefited at the expense of the Russian people and have played a role in supporting Putin's actions. The sanctions will include cutting off access to the U.S. financial system, freezing assets in the United States, and blocking the use of their property. The Department of Treasury will provide financial intelligence and evidence to the Department of Justice for potential criminal prosecutions and seizure of assets. Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, one of Russia's wealthiest individuals and a close ally of Putin, will have his property blocked, including his superyacht and private jet. Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, will also be sanctioned. Visa restrictions will be imposed on 19 oligarchs, 47 family members, and close associates. The United States and other governments will work to identify and freeze assets held by Russian elites in their respective jurisdictions. The article also mentions full blocking sanctions on disinformation targets, including Russian entities and individuals involved in spreading false narratives to advance Russian strategic objectives.
