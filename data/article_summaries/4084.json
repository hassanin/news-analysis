President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Florida due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from April 12 to April 14, 2023. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas, specifically Broward County. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to support individuals and business owners in recovering from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Brett H. Howard has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance online, by phone, or through the FEMA App. For more information, media should contact the FEMA News Desk.
