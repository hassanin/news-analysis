President Joseph R. Biden has proclaimed May 2021 as National Building Safety Month to recognize the importance of strengthening buildings and infrastructure for the safety and needs of Americans. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the significance of homes as spaces for education, work, childcare, and entertainment. President Biden acknowledges the need to repair and modernize buildings and infrastructure, particularly in the face of climate change. Vulnerable communities, especially low-income communities and people of color, are disproportionately affected by natural hazards caused by climate change. Investing in infrastructure and implementing modern building codes are effective measures to mitigate these hazards. The Biden administration has issued Executive Orders and established offices to prioritize climate change and resiliency. The American Jobs Plan aims to rebuild infrastructure, create jobs, and promote access to opportunity. Collaboration between government, non-profit organizations, and the private sector is crucial to ensuring safe and resilient communities. The Global Resiliency Dialogue and other initiatives work towards incorporating building and climate-based science into solutions. President Biden calls on citizens, organizations, and businesses to raise awareness and contribute to building safety at home and in their communities.
