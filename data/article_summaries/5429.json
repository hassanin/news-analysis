The Biden-Harris Administration is celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) by announcing new measures to support women's economic security. The FMLA allows Americans to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave from work for serious illness, caring for a new child, or a sick family member without the risk of losing their jobs. President Biden is encouraging heads of Federal agencies to provide access to leave for Federal employees, even during their first year of service. This is aimed at addressing the challenges faced by millions of workers, especially women, who often have to choose between their paycheck and caring for their families. The administration is also committed to advocating for national paid family and medical leave, affordable child care, and home and community-based care. President Biden is issuing a Presidential Memorandum to support Federal employees' access to leave when they need to care for themselves or loved ones. The memorandum also calls for recommendations on "safe leave" to support employees affected by domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. These actions build on the administration's efforts to improve access to and awareness of family and medical leave. The administration has also taken steps to support economic security for women and families.
