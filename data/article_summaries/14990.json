President Obama has signed an Executive Order and announced new initiatives to increase travel and tourism in the United States. The travel and tourism industry is a significant part of the US economy, contributing to GDP and employment. The President aims to create more American jobs by promoting the US as a tourism destination and improving visa processing. The Department of Commerce estimates that increasing international travel to the US could create over 1 million jobs in the next decade. The President's announcement includes measures to develop a national travel and tourism strategy, increase visa processing capacity in China and Brazil, expand the Visa Waiver Program, and make the Global Entry program permanent. The President has also appointed new members to the US Travel and Tourism Advisory Board and nominated Taiwan for the Visa Waiver Program.
