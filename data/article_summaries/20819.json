President Obama conducted a town hall meeting in Grand Junction, Colorado on health insurance reform. He discussed how under health insurance reform, insurance companies will have yearly caps on how much they can charge for out-of-pocket expenses to eliminate unlimited costs such as co-pays and deductibles. The President took questions from the audience for one hour. The majority of tickets were general admission and were randomly distributed to people who signed up online. Other tickets were given to elected officials and community leaders. Various officials were expected to attend, including Secretary Ken Salazar, U.S. Senators Mark Udall and Michael Bennet, U.S. Representative John Salazar, Governor Bill Ritter, and Mayor Bruce Hill. Stage participants included individuals delivering the Invocation, leading the Pledge of Allegiance, and singing the National Anthem. Nathan Wilkes, who faced challenges with his son's health insurance, introduced President Obama. The article also provided statistics on Colorado's unemployment rate and the impact of the Recovery Act in the state.
