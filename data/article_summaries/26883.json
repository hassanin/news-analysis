President Donald J. Trump has made a commitment to eliminate outdated, unnecessary, and harmful regulations that hinder job growth and are not in the national interest. He has inherited a bloated regulatory regime from the previous administration and is taking steps to cut red tape across the government. President Trump has signed legislation and executive orders to fulfill his promise of reducing needless regulation and getting government out of the way of American citizens.
