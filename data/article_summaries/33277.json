First Lady Melania Trump visited the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center to learn about the opioid epidemic in Ohio and spend time with young patients. She was briefed on the negative effects of opioids on newborns, particularly neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Mrs. Trump also visited an activity room and played with the children, bringing valentines and coloring books for each of them. She also met with a child who had overcome a serious illness and is now part of the hospital's champion family group. Mrs. Trump expressed gratitude for the hospital's research on combating opioid abuse and emphasized that children are her top priority.
