President Obama will be visiting TPI Composites, a wind manufacturer in Newton, Iowa, where he will urge Congress to take action on the "To Do List." This includes passing legislation to extend the Production Tax Credit (PTC) to support American jobs and manufacturing in the wind industry. He will also advocate for an expansion of the 48C Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit, which supports American-made clean energy manufacturing.
