President Biden has announced an extension of the pause on federal student loan repayments for an additional 90 days, through May 1, 2022. This is in response to the ongoing pandemic and the need to support student loan borrowers who are still facing challenges as a result. The Department of Education will continue to work with borrowers to ensure a smooth transition back into repayment. President Biden is also urging borrowers to take advantage of the Department's resources, explore options to lower payments, consider public service loan forgiveness, and ensure they are vaccinated.
