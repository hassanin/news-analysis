The White House has released a memorandum outlining the United States' support for United Nations (UN) peace operations. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of addressing state fragility and armed conflict to mitigate threats such as violent extremism, transnational terrorism, refugee flows, and humanitarian emergencies. The United States aims to strengthen international response mechanisms and promote burden-sharing globally. UN peace operations play a crucial role in conflict prevention, peacemaking, and peacebuilding, with activities ranging from mediation to the protection of civilians and human rights monitoring. The memorandum acknowledges the increasing complexity and demand for UN peace operations and highlights the need for systemic reform. The United States is committed to building partner capacity, providing diplomatic support and enabling capabilities, and leading efforts for reform at the UN. The memorandum also emphasizes the importance of accountability, gender diversity, and ending sexual exploitation and abuse within peace operations. The Departments of State and Defense will work together to implement the guidance outlined in the memorandum.
