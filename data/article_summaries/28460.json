On March 1, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order prescribing amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States. The order states that Part II, Part III, and Part IV of the Manual for Courts-Martial will be amended as described in Annex 1. The amendments will take effect on the date of the order, but will not make punishable any act done or omitted prior to that date. The order also clarifies that the amendments will not invalidate any nonjudicial punishment proceeding or other action begun prior to the date of the order. The order also addresses the Military Justice Act of 2016 (MJA), stating that it will take effect on January 1, 2019, with similar provisions regarding punishment, prosecution, and nonjudicial punishment proceedings. The order further amends the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, as described in Annex 2, with these amendments taking effect on January 1, 2019. The order also provides details on the application of certain articles and sections of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and the MJA, specifying their effective dates and applicability to cases and offenses committed before and after those dates. Finally, the order notes that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, will issue nonbinding guidance regarding the disposition of charges and specifications in the interest of justice and discipline.
