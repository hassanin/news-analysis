In Presidential Determination No. 2022-17, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declares that ensuring a robust and sustainable domestic industrial base for clean energy is crucial for national security and the preservation of critical infrastructure. He determines that electrolyzers, fuel cells, and platinum group metals are essential resources for the national defense. Without Presidential action, the United States industry would not be able to meet the demand for these resources in a timely manner. Therefore, the President authorizes purchases and other actions under the Defense Production Act to address this need. He also waives certain requirements of the Act to expand domestic production capabilities for electrolyzers, fuel cells, and platinum group metals. The determination is directed to be published in the Federal Register.
