The White House hosted the Quad Investor Network (QUIN) for its first Quad Investment and Technology Dialogue. The event aimed to discuss strategies for increasing private capital for cross-border investment between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. Over 40 business executives from Quad countries attended the event, along with senior representatives from the Embassies of Australia, India, and Japan. The discussion focused on investment opportunities in critical resources and emerging technologies to promote prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific Region. QUIN was launched in May at the Quad Leaders' Summit and serves as a network of investors and executives across Quad countries to encourage co-investment in critical and emerging technologies.
