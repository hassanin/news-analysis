The Biden Administration has announced that it will facilitate the air shipment of approximately 4.6 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Bubs Australia infant formula. Two flights, organized by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), will transport the formula from Melbourne, Australia to Pennsylvania and California on June 9 and June 11. This delivery will include 380,000 pounds of Bubs Australia infant formula. Additional deliveries of Bubs Australia infant formula will be announced soon.

Last week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that Bubs Australia can export infant formula, and the agency will exercise enforcement discretion. Bubs Australia plans to export enough powdered formula to produce 27.5 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of various varieties of its infant formulas to the United States.

President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure it reaches stores quickly. Under this operation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) can use Department of Defense (DOD)-contracted commercial aircraft to transport overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards.

Additionally, the Biden Administration has invoked the Defense Production Act and reached a consent agreement with the FDA to reopen Abbott Nutrition's Sturgis facility. They have also issued FDA guidance to enable major formula manufacturers to safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the U.S. market.
