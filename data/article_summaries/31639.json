On November 1, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding immigration and refugee admissions for Fiscal Year 2020. The memorandum states that up to 18,000 refugees will be admitted to the United States during this period for humanitarian concerns or national interest. The refugees will be allocated based on specific categories:

1. Refugees who have been persecuted or fear persecution based on religion or fall under specific categories established by the Lautenberg and Specter Amendments - 5,000 refugees.
2. Refugees who fall under the category listed in the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007 - 4,000 refugees.
3. Refugees who are nationals or habitual residents of El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras - 1,500 refugees.
4. Other refugees, including those referred by a US Embassy, those who gain access through family reunification or specific processes, and those currently in Australia, Nauru, or Papua New Guinea - 7,500 refugees.

The total refugee admissions ceiling for Fiscal Year 2020 is set at 18,000. The memorandum also authorizes the transfer of unused admissions from one allocation to another, based on national interest and the need for greater admissions in specific allocations.

Additionally, the memorandum designates assistance to persons applying for admission to the US as part of the overseas refugee admissions program as contributing to the foreign policy interests of the United States. It also specifies that certain individuals in Cuba, Eurasia and the Baltics, Iraq, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and individuals identified by US Embassies in exceptional circumstances may be considered refugees for admission to the United States within their countries of nationality or habitual residence.

The memorandum directs the publication of this determination in the Federal Register.
