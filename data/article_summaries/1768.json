In a ceremony at the White House, President Biden awarded the Medal of Honor to four soldiers who served during the Vietnam conflict. The recipients were Staff Sergeant Edward N. Kaneshiro, Specialist Five Dwight W. Birdwell, Specialist Five Dennis M. Fujii, and Major John J. Duffy. The President recognized their acts of gallantry and intrepidity, and their selflessness in putting the lives of others ahead of their own. Each soldier's heroic actions were described in detail during the ceremony. President Biden also expressed gratitude to the families of the recipients and acknowledged the sacrifices they made. He emphasized the importance of properly recognizing and honoring the contributions of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders who have served in the military. The President also acknowledged the presence of other Medal of Honor recipients in attendance and paid tribute to Hershel Woody Williams, the last Medal of Honor recipient of World War II, who recently passed away. The ceremony concluded with a prayer.
