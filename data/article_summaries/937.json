Today, senior White House officials, including Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Ambassador Susan Rice, and Lael Brainard, gathered state legislative leaders to discuss efforts to address "junk fees" that burden consumers. President Biden has previously expressed his commitment to combating these unfair and hidden fees, and he called on Congress to pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act. Federal agencies have already taken steps to crack down on deceptive fees, and the private sector has followed suit. The White House has released a guide to help states crack down on junk fees, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development has encouraged housing providers and local governments to adopt policies promoting fairness and transparency for renters. State legislators from New York, Vermont, and California shared the steps they are taking to combat junk fees, including requiring ticket retailers to display all-inclusive prices and prohibiting undisclosed resort fees. The White House commended the state leaders for their work in protecting American families from these fees.
