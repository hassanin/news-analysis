In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims July 17 to July 23, 2011, as Captive Nations Week. He acknowledges the brave actions of ordinary people yearning for freedom and emphasizes the commitment of the United States to advancing freedom's cause. The proclamation originated from President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959, during the Cold War, to show support for individual liberties under Communist oppression. The article highlights the transformation of the world since then, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union leading to the emergence of new democracies and the expansion of human rights. The United States stands firmly behind those seeking to exercise their basic human rights and opposes violence and repression. The proclamation also calls for the promotion of democratic values, economic development, and respect for human dignity.
