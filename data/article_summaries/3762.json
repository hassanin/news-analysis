President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has terminated the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13712, which was issued in November 2015 regarding the situation in Burundi. The declaration was made due to various issues, including violence against civilians, unrest, incitement of imminent violence, and political repression. The President has determined that the situation has significantly improved over the past year, with decreased violence and President Ndayishimiye's pursuit of reforms. As a result, the suspension of entry for individuals meeting the criteria set forth in Executive Order 13712 will no longer be in effect. The termination of the national emergency will not affect any ongoing actions, proceedings, or rights that were already established prior to this order. The order does not impact the authority of executive departments or agencies, nor does it create any new rights or benefits enforceable against the United States or its entities.
