In this article, President Barack Obama declares January 2014 as National Stalking Awareness Month in the United States. The article highlights the prevalence of stalking and its impact on victims, emphasizing that anyone can be a victim regardless of age, sex, background, or gender identity. Stalkers intimidate their victims through repeated unwanted contact, including harassment via phone calls, text messages, or emails. Cyberstalking is also mentioned as a growing issue. Stalking often goes unreported but tends to escalate over time, putting victims at risk of sexual assault, physical abuse, or even homicide. The Obama administration is committed to pursuing justice for stalking victims and ensuring they receive support. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act was signed into law in March, expanding protections for Native American and LGBTQ+ victims. The act also required colleges to report crime statistics on stalking and strengthened support and training programs for law enforcement. The article acknowledges the tireless work of advocates who provide essential services to victims and calls for individuals to recognize the signs of stalking, acknowledge it as a serious crime, and support victims and survivors.
