Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at Howard University about the importance of supporting small businesses, particularly those owned by marginalized communities. She highlighted the challenges faced by entrepreneurs in accessing capital and financial services, and the disparities faced by Black, Latino, rural, and immigrant business owners. Harris praised community lenders, such as Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), for their role in supporting underserved communities. She shared the story of a small business owner who was initially rejected by a traditional bank but received a loan from a community lender, which helped her build a successful catering business. Harris announced the extension and expansion of the Small Business Administration's Community Advantage program, which partially guarantees loans made by community lenders. She also mentioned other improvements to the program, such as simplifying requirements and allowing borrowers to restructure debt. Harris emphasized that supporting small businesses leads to job creation, innovation, and economic growth. She called for continued efforts to address the inequities faced by marginalized communities and encouraged the replication of the model demonstrated by the Greater Washington Partnership's $4.7 billion investment, a portion of which will go to community lenders.
