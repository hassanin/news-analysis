President Obama has announced an additional $300 million in humanitarian assistance to help those affected by the ongoing conflict in Syria. This brings the total U.S. humanitarian assistance for the Syria crisis to nearly $815 million. The aid will be used to provide food, medical care, clean water, and shelter to families suffering in Syria and neighboring countries. The United States is now providing aid to 3.2 million people in Syria across all 14 governorates. The increased funding will also support Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, and Egypt, providing them with shelter, education, healthcare, and food assistance.
