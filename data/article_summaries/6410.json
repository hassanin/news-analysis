In Executive Order 14013, President Biden directed actions to rebuild and improve the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Due to an unforeseen emergency refugee situation, the Department of State proposed to increase the FY 2021 refugee admissions from 15,000 to 62,500. In Presidential Determination 2021-05, the allocation of admissions was changed based on the emergency situation. Although the number of admissions remained at 15,000, President Biden stated that he would consider raising the ceiling if necessary. After further consideration and consultation with Congress, President Biden has now determined that raising the number of admissions to 62,500 is justified due to humanitarian concerns and in the national interest. This determination sets a goal for USRAP and its partners to resettle refugees. The allocations for different regions are adjusted accordingly. The intention is to send a message that the United States is a safe harbor for vulnerable individuals and to challenge the government and its partners to build capacity to serve more refugees.
