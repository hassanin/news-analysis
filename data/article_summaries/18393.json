The proclamation emphasized the founding principles of the nation, including the protection of rights and the pursuit of happiness for all citizens. It highlighted the loyalty and patriotism of Americans throughout history, from the early settlers to recent immigrants. The proclamation also recognized the sacrifices made by members of the United States Armed Forces and those who fought for civil rights. Loyalty Day is a national observance to honor the nation and its legacy of freedom and equal opportunity. The proclamation called upon all Americans to support this observance and display the flag of the United States on Loyalty Day.
