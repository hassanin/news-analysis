This article discusses the VA Vet Centers and the progress made by the administration in improving mental health services for veterans, servicemembers, and their families. Vet Centers are community-based counseling centers that provide a range of social and psychological services, including readjustment counseling. They have non-traditional hours and prioritize access to care. There are 300 Vet Centers across the country, and there are also 80 Mobile Vet Centers that provide services to rural communities. Vet Center services are available to veterans and servicemembers regardless of their enrollment status with the Department of Veteran Affairs, disability rating, or discharge character. The article also mentions recent steps taken by the VA and DoD to improve mental health care, such as automatically enrolling servicemembers in the inTransition program and allowing them to maintain access to mental health medication during their transition to the VA. The 2016 Budget provides over $7 billion for mental health services for veterans, including treatment for PTSD and Military Sexual Trauma. The administration has also increased mental health staffing, enhanced the Veterans Crisis Line, and developed a National Research Action Plan on military and veteran's mental health. The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for America Veterans (SAV) Act was signed in February 2015 to further address veterans' mental health and suicide prevention.
