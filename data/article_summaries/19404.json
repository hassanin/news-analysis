In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims December 15, 2011, as Bill of Rights Day. He highlights the importance of the Bill of Rights in protecting the fundamental freedoms of American citizens, such as freedom of speech and religion, and ensuring equal justice under the law. The Bill of Rights was introduced in 1789 and was born out of compromise, allowing for the ratification of the Constitution without fear of a more centralized government encroaching on individual liberties. Obama emphasizes that the rights and liberties enjoyed today are a result of the sacrifices made by previous generations, including service members and civil rights activists. He calls upon the American people to celebrate this proud legacy and work towards creating an America that upholds the vision of the Founding Fathers.
