Christina Romer, President of the Council of Economic Advisers, released a statement on the labor situation in July. Private sector employment increased by 71,000, marking the seventh consecutive month of growth. However, the growth rate was not enough to reduce the unemployment rate, which remained at 9.5%. There were significant variations in job growth across sectors, with increases in industrial production and education and health services, but decreases in financial services, construction, and state and local governments. Payroll employment overall decreased by 131,000, largely due to the conclusion of temporary Census jobs. Despite these fluctuations, private sector employment has increased by 630,000 since December 2009. The average weekly hours in the private sector also increased slightly. Manufacturing jobs increased by 36,000, continuing a seven-month upward trend. However, jobs in financial services and construction decreased, and the number of temporary jobs decreased for the first time since November 2009. The unemployment rate remained stable at 9.5%, with a decrease among workers with only a high school education. Romer emphasized the importance of additional labor measures, such as fiscal aid to states and legislation supporting small businesses and clean energy investments, in order to continue improving the labor market. She also cautioned against placing too much importance on any one monthly report, as employment and unemployment figures are volatile and subject to revision. The focus should be on sustained improvements in job creation.
