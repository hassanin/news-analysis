On April 19, 2016, President Barack Obama issued an executive order titled "Blocking Property and Suspending Entry into the United States of Persons Contributing to the Situation in Libya." The order expands the scope of a national emergency declared in 2011, finding that the ongoing violence in Libya threatens the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, democratic transition, and territorial integrity of the country, which poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The order blocks the property and interests in property of persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to be responsible for or complicit in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Libya, obstruct the adoption of a Government of National Accord, misappropriate state assets, or threaten Libyan state financial institutions or the Libyan National Oil Company. The order also suspends the entry into the United States of such persons. The order prohibits transactions that evade or violate its prohibitions, as well as any conspiracy to violate its prohibitions. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to carry out the purposes of the order, and all agencies of the United States Government are directed to take appropriate measures to implement it.
