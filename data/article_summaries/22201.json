President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Vermont, authorizing federal aid to support recovery efforts from a severe storm and flooding that occurred on June 9, 2015. The federal funding will be available for emergency work, as well as the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in the counties of Addison and Chittenden. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
