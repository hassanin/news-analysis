The President will host the next White House Tribal Nations Summit on November 30 and December 1 at the Department of the Interior in Washington, D.C. The President has made strengthening Nation-to-Nation relationships, honoring trust and treaty obligations with federally-recognized Tribes, and advancing Tribal sovereignty and self-determination a priority since taking office. The Administration has also made historic investments in Tribal communities through the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act. This year's Summit will provide an opportunity for Tribal leaders to discuss the implementation of these priorities, new policies, and other important issues facing Tribal communities with senior administration officials.
