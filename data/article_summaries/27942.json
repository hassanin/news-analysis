In a press briefing, President Trump discussed the progress being made on developing a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. He stated that three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials and emphasized that safety is a priority. The administration is manufacturing vaccines in advance and plans to deliver them to the American people within 24 hours of approval. The goal is to have at least 100 million vaccine doses manufactured by the end of the year, with enough vaccines for every American by April. The President also announced a $13 billion emergency relief award to rebuild Puerto Rico's electrical grid and educational system. He expressed his commitment to bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to Puerto Rico and criticized Joe Biden for past decisions that negatively impacted the island. Additionally, President Trump discussed the situation in the Middle East, the TikTok deal, and concerns about mail-in voting.
