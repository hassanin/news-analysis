In this article, President Obama discusses the importance of health insurance reform in rebuilding and strengthening the economy. He emphasizes that reform is not only about the 47 million uninsured Americans, but also about those who fear losing coverage due to illness, job loss, or changing jobs. The skyrocketing cost of Medicare and Medicaid is identified as a major driver of the federal deficit, and controlling these costs is crucial. If health care is not reformed, premiums and out-of-pocket costs will continue to rise, and thousands of Americans will lose their health insurance daily. The President addresses the concerns of Americans by explaining the benefits of the proposed reform, such as increased security and stability for those with existing insurance, prevention of coverage denial due to pre-existing conditions, and the ability to choose quality, affordable health plans through a marketplace. He also assures that health insurance reform will not add to the deficit. The President acknowledges the political game surrounding the debate but emphasizes that this issue is about the everyday Americans who need affordable and accessible health care. He states that they cannot wait any longer for reform and that leadership is needed to pass reform that lowers costs, promotes choice, and provides coverage for all Americans.
