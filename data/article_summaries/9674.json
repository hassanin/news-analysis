On March 21, 2010, the White House Office of the Press Secretary released a statement from Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer regarding the President's announcement of issuing an executive order after the passage of the health insurance reform law. The executive order is intended to reaffirm the law's consistency with longstanding restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion. The order aims to provide additional safeguards to ensure that the law's restrictions against public funding of abortions cannot be circumvented. The President believes that this health insurance reform should not disrupt longstanding precedent, and the legislation and executive order are consistent with this principle. The President acknowledges the efforts of leaders from both sides of the abortion issue in crafting a consensus approach for the bill to move forward. The statement also includes the text of the pending executive order, which establishes policies and procedures to enforce and implement abortion restrictions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The order maintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions on abortion policy and extends them to the newly-created health insurance exchanges. It also emphasizes the importance of strict compliance with prohibitions on abortion funding in the exchanges and provides guidelines for state health insurance commissioners to ensure compliance. The order addresses the Community Health Center Program and directs the Secretary of HHS to ensure that program administrators and recipients of federal funds are aware of and comply with existing limitations on abortion services. The statement concludes with general provisions regarding the implementation of the executive order.
