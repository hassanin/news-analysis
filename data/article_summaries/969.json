The President of the United States has extended the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13224 in response to the threat of terrorism. The national emergency was initially declared on September 23, 2001, following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The President signed Executive Order 13886 on September 9, 2019, to strengthen and consolidate sanctions against international terrorism. The extension of the national emergency is necessary due to the ongoing threat posed by individuals who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism. This extension will remain in effect beyond September 23, 2023, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice of the extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
