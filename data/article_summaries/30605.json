On September 26, 2019, the President signed into law H.R. 1200, known as the "Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2019." This law ensures that beneficiaries of veterans' disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) equal to the Social Security COLA.
