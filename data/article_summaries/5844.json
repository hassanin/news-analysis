On February 17, 2023, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared the continuation of a national emergency with respect to Cuba. This emergency was initially declared on March 1, 1996, in response to the destruction of two unarmed, United States-registered civilian aircraft by the Cuban government. Over the years, the national emergency has been expanded and modified to address disturbances or threatened disturbances of international relations caused by the Cuban government. The Cuban government has not demonstrated a commitment to refraining from using excessive force against US vessels or aircraft engaged in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. Additionally, unauthorized entry of US-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is seen as detrimental to US foreign policy as it could facilitate mass migration from Cuba, which poses a threat to US national security and international relations. The national emergency grants emergency authority to regulate the anchorage and movement of vessels. This declaration will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
