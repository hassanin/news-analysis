The White House released a fact sheet on the United Nations Security Council Summit on Nuclear Nonproliferation and Nuclear Disarmament, which took place on September 24, 2009. The meeting, chaired by President Barack Obama, resulted in the unanimous adoption of UNSC Resolution 1887, which commits to work towards a world without nuclear weapons and outlines a framework for reducing global nuclear dangers. The resolution supports a revitalized commitment to nuclear arms reduction, a strengthened Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), better security for nuclear weapons materials, the Security Council's authority in addressing the threat of nuclear weapons, addressing challenges to the nonproliferation regime, encouraging peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and efforts to prevent access to the international financial system by proliferating states and non-state actors. The resolution also includes provisions to deter withdrawal from the NPT and ensure the responsible use of nuclear energy. The meeting was attended by several world leaders and representatives from international organizations.
