President Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which aims to make higher education more affordable and help more Americans earn a college degree. The legislation strengthens the Pell Grant program, invests in community colleges, extends support for Historically Black Colleges and other Minority Serving Institutions, and helps student borrowers manage their loan debt. This will be achieved by ending government subsidies to banks and other financial institutions that make guaranteed federal student loans, freeing up nearly $68 billion for college affordability and deficit reduction over the next 11 years. The law also includes provisions to ensure that all eligible students receive Pell Grants and that loan repayments are capped at 10% of discretionary income, with loan forgiveness after 20 years. Additionally, $2 billion will be allocated to community colleges for education and career training programs. Starting July 1, all new federal student loans will be delivered and collected by private companies under performance-based contracts with the Department of Education.
