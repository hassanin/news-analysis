President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Oklahoma and has authorized federal aid to assist in recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between June 13-15, 2010. The federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also be eligible for federal funding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Gregory W. Eaton as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Further damage assessments may lead to additional designations and assistance.
