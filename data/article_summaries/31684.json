In a press conference at Joint Base Andrews, President Trump discussed his upcoming visits to Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri, expressing optimism about the packed crowds and the energy surrounding his campaign. He also mentioned the possibility of a meeting with Russian President Putin at the G20 Summit, but clarified that it may not take place in Paris. When asked about networks declining to run his immigration ad, Trump said he was unaware of the situation but claimed that his ads are effective. He dismissed questions about the offensive nature of the ad and about the midterm election being a referendum on his presidency. Trump expressed confidence in doing well in the Senate and House races, attributing it to the party in power historically not performing well during midterms. He also addressed the issue of funding for the border wall, stating that he will see what happens after the election and suggesting that others may want to get things done. Trump claimed that there is proof of people intending to illegally vote in the midterms and stated that there will be prosecutions at the highest level. On the topic of Iran sanctions, he explained that while the sanctions are tough, he wants to go slower with oil sanctions to avoid driving up oil prices worldwide. Trump mentioned the possibility of making changes in his administration after the midterms but did not provide a specific timeline. He also stated that he will announce the new U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations before the end of the week. Trump denied rumors of changing the Secretary of Defense and expressed that he believes Secretary Zinke has done a good job, but would look into any reports of wrongdoing.
