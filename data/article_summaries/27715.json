On National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation honoring the more than 500,000 American warriors who have been captured while defending the country. These prisoners of war (POWs) have endured unimaginable torture and suffering, yet they persevered for the sake of their fellow POWs, comrades, families, and country. The proclamation also highlights the upcoming 75th anniversary of the conclusion of World War II, during which nearly 94,000 American troops in Europe and 27,000 in the Pacific were captured and subjected to inhumane conditions. The proclamation calls upon Americans to observe this day by honoring the service and sacrifice of all former POWs and expressing gratitude for their sacrifice. It also encourages government officials and organizations to hold appropriate ceremonies and activities to commemorate the day.
