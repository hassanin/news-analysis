The President has directed the establishment of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC), a national intelligence center focused on analyzing and connecting malicious foreign cyber threats and cyber incidents affecting U.S. national interests. The CTIIC will provide all-source intelligence analysis, support cybersecurity efforts, and help counter foreign cyber threats. It will not collect intelligence or replace existing departments, agencies, or government cyber centers, but will support and provide intelligence to these entities. The CTIIC's specific location is yet to be determined, but it is expected to be located in the Washington, DC metro area. The organizational structure will consist of approximately 50 government personnel. Privacy and civil liberties will be protected in accordance with applicable policy and legal frameworks.
