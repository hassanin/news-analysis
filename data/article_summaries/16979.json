This article announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism. The national emergency was declared in 2001 in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11th. The actions of these individuals continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency will remain in effect for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
