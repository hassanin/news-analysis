The Afghan Parliament has approved the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) and the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). These agreements allow for continued cooperation between Afghanistan and the United States in non-combat missions, such as targeting al-Qaida remnants and training Afghan National Security Forces. The NATO SOFA provides legal protections for forces from Allied and partner countries involved in the NATO Resolute Support mission. The approval of these agreements is seen as a positive step towards strengthening the relationship between Afghanistan and the United States. It is also a result of the newly formed government of national unity and the historic Afghan election that brought about the first peaceful democratic transfer of power in the country. The BSA fully implements the Strategic Partnership Agreement signed by the two governments in 2012 and contributes to the security and stability of Afghanistan, as well as the United States and its coalition partners.
