This article is about a series of executive orders issued by President Donald J. Trump regarding foreign policy, specifically targeting Iran. The President declares that it is the policy of the United States to counter Iran's malign influence in the Middle East, including the transfer of conventional weapons and acquisition of arms by Iran. The President orders the blocking of property and interests in property of individuals or entities engaged in activities that contribute to the supply, sale, or transfer of arms to or from Iran, as well as those providing technical training, financial resources, or services related to arms. The prohibitions also apply to those engaged in activities that contribute to the proliferation of arms or provide support to individuals or entities whose property is blocked. The entry into the United States of aliens meeting the criteria of the order is suspended, except when it is determined to be in the interests of the United States. The order also prohibits transactions that evade or avoid the prohibitions, and the making of donations to blocked individuals or entities. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to carry out the order. The order does not apply to transactions involving the provision of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical devices to Iran, or to transactions related to the official business of the United States Government or the United Nations. The measures taken are in response to actions of the Government of Iran occurring after the 1981 Algiers Accords. The order does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
