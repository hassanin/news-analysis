On the anniversary of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the United States reaffirms its ban on torture and opposition to inhumane treatment. The use of torture goes against the nation's principles, and the U.S. must never resort to its use again. Torture is known to be an ineffective method for gathering reliable intelligence, it is universally prohibited and violates U.S. and international law, it fuels terrorism and extremism, and it compromises the country's moral standing. On the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, the U.S. recognizes those who have endured the pain of torture, and pledges efforts to eradicate torture in all forms. The U.S. has nominated a legal expert to sit on the Committee Against Torture, requested the largest ever budget for the U.S. Survivors of Torture Program, and remains the largest contributor to the UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. The U.S. urges other governments to support this critical aid for torture survivors. The article concludes by stating that torture, wherever it occurs, is a stain on our moral conscience, and everyone must intensify efforts to end this inhumane practice.
