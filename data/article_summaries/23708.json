In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims May 2010 as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. He acknowledges the contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to the nation and highlights their common struggles in overcoming discrimination. The article also mentions the 100th anniversary of the Angel Island Immigration Station, which served as a point of entry for immigrants from across the Pacific but subjected them to harsh conditions and interrogations. Despite these challenges, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have succeeded in various fields and have played significant roles in the civil rights movement, the Armed Forces, business, academia, and public service. However, the article also recognizes the challenges that these communities still face, such as unemployment, poverty, education and health disparities, and increased diagnoses of diseases like diabetes, hepatitis, and HIV/AIDS. To address these concerns, the Obama Administration has reestablished the White House Initiative and the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing these critical issues to ensure that all Americans can achieve their full potential.
