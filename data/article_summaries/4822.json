President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke with President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi of Egypt to express his gratitude for Egypt's efforts in securing the release of hostages held by Hamas and establishing a humanitarian pause in Gaza. They also discussed plans to provide additional humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza. President Biden emphasized that the United States will not allow the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, the besiegement of Gaza, or any changes to Gaza's borders. He also stressed that Gaza cannot serve as a safe haven for Hamas to threaten both Israel and Palestinians, and endanger the prospects of a lasting peace. President Biden affirmed his commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state and recognized Egypt's crucial role in achieving that goal. The two leaders agreed to maintain close communication as the hostage release deal is fully implemented in the coming days.
