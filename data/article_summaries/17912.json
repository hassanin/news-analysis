The White House has released a notice stating President Obama's intention to enter into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement. The agreement aims to create export opportunities for various sectors in the United States, such as manufacturing, services, agriculture, and businesses. The agreement also aims to generate job growth and provide American consumers with more choices while saving them money. The TPP Agreement is being negotiated with countries including Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam, as long as they meet certain market-access goals and agree to high-standard obligations. The notice will be published in the Federal Register, as required by law.
