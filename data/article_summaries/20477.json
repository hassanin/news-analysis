President Obama is set to meet with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos to discuss various issues related to their bilateral partnership. They are expected to approve an Action Plan on Labor Rights and discuss the next steps for the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. The two leaders will also review their cooperation on security, economic, and social matters. This will be their second meeting, with their first one taking place in September 2010 during the UN General Assembly in New York City.
