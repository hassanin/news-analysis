The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the United States is addressing the issue of high prescription drug prices. The HHS is focused on four major problems in drug markets: the rapid increase in drug prices by manufacturers, the lack of tools for government programs and private payers to negotiate lower prices, high out-of-pocket costs for Americans, and the pressure from foreign countries with government-run healthcare systems that drive down drug prices. The HHS has already taken action, such as the FDA's Drug Competition Action Plan to encourage lower prices through competition and CMS's policy changes to save seniors money on out-of-pocket drug spending. President Trump's 2019 budget also proposes a plan to modernize Medicare Part D and lower costs for seniors. The HHS is formulating a blueprint for reform, which will focus on increasing competition, giving Medicare Part D plans better tools to negotiate discounts, incentivizing drug manufacturers to lower list prices, and developing options to lower patients' out-of-pocket spending. The goal is to ensure that Americans can access and afford the innovative medicines and treatments of the 21st century.
