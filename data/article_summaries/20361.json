Vice President Biden released a statement expressing his sadness at the passing of Professor Wangari Maathai, who he met in Nairobi over a year ago. He recognized her as the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and acknowledged her contributions to Africa and humanity. He highlighted her founding of the Green Belt Movement, which planted 40 million trees and advocated for conservation, democracy, and women's rights. He praised her for identifying connections between environmental degradation and poverty, which influenced policymakers and activists. Despite facing imprisonment and financial hardships, Maathai remained determined and "unbowed." The Vice President ended by sharing Maathai's words of continuing restlessness and perseverance for those who will carry on her work.
