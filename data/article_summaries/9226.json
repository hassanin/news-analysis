President Biden has requested the Acting Secretary of Education to extend the pause on federal student loan payments and collections, while keeping the interest rate at 0%. The aim is to alleviate the financial burden on Americans who are facing difficulty in meeting basic needs and supporting their families. The extension will prevent individuals from having to choose between paying their student loans and providing for themselves and their families.
