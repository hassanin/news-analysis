President Biden has signed an Executive Order to expand the tools available to hold the Nicaraguan Ortega-Murillo regime accountable for human rights violations, attacks on civil society, and increasing security cooperation with Russia. The regime has arbitrarily detained political opponents and activists, closed non-governmental organizations, and subjected political prisoners to harsh conditions. The regime has also increased its cooperation with Russia, even voting against a UN resolution condemning Russia's illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine. These actions build on previous efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to support the Nicaraguan people and hold the regime accountable.
