Vice President Kamala Harris had a virtual meeting with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to discuss ways to deepen cooperation between the United States and Mexico in addressing the root causes of migration from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. They emphasized the importance of the partnership between the two countries and the need to work together on recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, building climate resilience, and expanding economic opportunity and security cooperation. The leaders agreed to establish a strategic partnership to address the challenges causing migration from the Northern Triangle region, including lack of employment, limited market access, deforestation, and regional instability due to climate change. Vice President Harris expressed the U.S. commitment to working with Mexico on economic development in the Northern Triangle and southern Mexico, protecting workers' rights, and expanding opportunities for U.S. business collaboration. The United States has developed a package of measures that include trade and business development missions, investments, and collaboration with Mexico. The governments also discussed their desire to combat migrant smuggling and human trafficking by bringing together law enforcement from both nations to dismantle criminal networks. They will share information and expertise to secure their borders and protect human rights. Vice President Harris is set to visit Mexico on June 8.
