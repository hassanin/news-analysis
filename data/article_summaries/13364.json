The White House released a report on the Administration's all-of-the-above energy strategy, highlighting the transformation in the domestic energy sector since the President took office. The strategy aims to support economic growth, enhance energy security, and lay the foundation for a low-carbon energy future. The report states that natural gas consumption has increased by 18% since 2005, and wind, solar, and geothermal energy have more than doubled since 2009. The energy sector has contributed to GDP growth and job creation, with the oil and natural gas sector alone contributing to real GDP growth and employment. The United States has reduced its total carbon pollution since 2005 more than any other nation, but more work needs to be done in addressing this issue. The strategy includes support for natural gas as a transition fuel, as well as renewables, nuclear, and other zero-carbon energy sources through research and development.
