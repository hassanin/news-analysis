President Obama has declared a major disaster in Texas due to severe winter storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between December 26, 2015 and January 21, 2016. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be used for emergency work, repairing or replacing damaged facilities, and implementing hazard mitigation measures. The declaration currently covers 26 counties, but additional assistance may be designated as damage assessments are completed. Kevin L. Hannes has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
