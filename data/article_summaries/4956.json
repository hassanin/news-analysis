The United States has announced sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. Germany, a leader in the effort to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, has halted certification of the project. The US and Germany have been closely coordinating their efforts to address the situation, and these sanctions are part of the initial response. President Biden has made it clear that further steps will be taken if Russia continues to escalate. The actions of President Putin have incentivized the world to move away from Russian gas and towards other forms of energy. The US appreciates Germany's partnership and dedication to holding Russia accountable.
