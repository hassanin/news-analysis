The article discusses the release of the first-ever presidential directive on additional national security factors for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to consider when evaluating transactions. The directive recognizes the risks posed by certain foreign investments, particularly those from competitor or adversarial nations, and aims to ensure that CFIUS remains effective in addressing these threats. The directive emphasizes the importance of preserving U.S. technological leadership, protecting sensitive data, and enhancing supply chain resilience. It provides direction to CFIUS by elaborating on existing statutory factors and adds several new national security factors for consideration. The directive also highlights the need for continuous improvements in the foreign investment review process to adapt to evolving national security threats. It is part of the broader strategy of the Biden-Harris Administration to maintain U.S. economic and technological leadership while protecting national security.
