During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz discussed President Obama's upcoming visit to the University of Chicago Law School. The President will participate in a discussion on the Supreme Court and the integrity of the judicial system. Schultz mentioned that the President is looking forward to visiting the institution where he taught constitutional law and will discuss how he fulfilled his constitutional responsibility by nominating Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court. Schultz also addressed questions about the President's support for draft legislation that would require technology companies to help law enforcement crack encrypted data. He stated that the White House supports strong encryption but wants to ensure that terrorists do not have a safe haven in cyberspace. Additionally, Schultz mentioned that Senator Dick Durbin, Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Representative Mike Quigley are accompanying the President on the trip, and that Senator Mark Kirk was invited but did not attend. He also discussed the President's endorsement of Tammy Duckworth for Senate and commented on the President's view of Hillary Clinton's qualifications to be President. Schultz also touched on the recent Treasury Department ruling on inversions, the situation in Puerto Rico, and the President's response to the release of the Panama Papers.
