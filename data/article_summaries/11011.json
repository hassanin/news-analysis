During President Barack Obama's state visit to Laos, the United States and Laos officially inaugurated the Comprehensive Partnership between the two countries. The partnership is based on mutual respect, common interests, and a shared desire to build a foundation for the future. The Comprehensive Partnership includes cooperation in areas such as political and diplomatic relations, trade and economic ties, science and technology, education and training, environment and health, humanitarian cooperation, war legacy issues, security, protection and promotion of human rights, and people-to-people ties. Both leaders also committed to enhancing cooperation at regional and international fora, such as ASEAN, to support peace, stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region. They also discussed addressing war legacy issues, including unexploded ordnance (UXO) in Laos, and announced the United States' intention to contribute $90 million over three years for a national UXO survey and clearance. Other areas of cooperation include humanitarian assistance, trade and economic ties, education, health and nutrition, and environmental issues. The leaders also affirmed their commitment to defense and security cooperation, as well as the promotion and protection of human rights. They highlighted the importance of people-to-people ties and encouraged more exchanges focusing on solving shared global challenges, particularly with a focus on youth leadership and entrepreneurship.
