U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra has authorized the first two Defense Production Act (DPA) authorizations for infant formula. This means that two infant formula manufacturers can now give priority to their orders with suppliers over other customers. Last week, the President invoked the DPA to ensure that manufacturers have the necessary ingredients to produce safe and healthy infant formula in the country. Additionally, the President announced that a flight called Operation Fly Formula will transport 114 pallets of Gerber Good Start Extensive HA infant formula later this week. This is part of a shipment that includes three different hypoallergenic formulas for children with cow's milk protein allergy. These formulas have been prioritized due to their critical medical purpose and the shortage caused by the closure of the Abbott Sturgis plant. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to use the Defense Production Act to increase infant formula production and address the shortage caused by the Abbott Nutrition voluntary recall.
