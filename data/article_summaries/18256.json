President Barack Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum titled "Enhanced Collection of Relevant Data and Statistics Relating to Women." The memorandum highlights the release of the report "Women in America," which provides information on the status of American women in various areas such as families and income, health, employment, education, and violence and crime. The report aims to serve as a resource for government officials, academics, non-profit organizations, journalists, and researchers. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of data collection and requests executive departments and agencies to identify and fill gaps in statistics and improve survey methodology related to women. Examples of specific efforts include improving the collection of maternal mortality data and gathering information on women's leadership in corporate America and public service. The memorandum clarifies that it should be carried out within legal limits and budget constraints and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized to publish the memorandum.
