During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer discussed two executive orders that President Trump will be signing on trade. The first order directs the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to examine trade abuse and non-reciprocal practices that contribute to the large and persistent trade deficit of the United States. The second order addresses the lack of enforcement of countervailing duties, which are used to combat unfair trade practices. Spicer also mentioned the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the election, stating that the President wants former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to testify and be open and transparent. Additionally, Spicer addressed concerns about classified information leaks and the issue of sanctuary cities. He stated that the President believes cities that refuse to share immigration status information should not receive federal funding. Spicer also discussed the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, stating that the President wants to address national security issues and trade concerns.
