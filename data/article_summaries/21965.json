The White House has announced that the Peace Corps will open a program in Burma to support the country's democratic transition and economic development. The first Peace Corps volunteers will arrive in late 2015 and undergo comprehensive training before moving to their volunteer sites for two years. They will work with local communities to strengthen capacity, facilitate cultural exchanges, and build lasting friendships. The Peace Corps was established in 1961 as a symbol of peace and friendship between the United States and other nations, and has since sent volunteers to 140 countries worldwide. This new program will make Burma the 141st country with a Peace Corps program.
