President Obama has sent a letter to Congress requesting emergency appropriations for Fiscal Year 2015 to address the Ebola outbreak. The request includes $6.18 billion to implement a comprehensive strategy to contain and end the outbreak in Africa, enhance domestic preparedness, speed up vaccine and therapeutic development, and improve global capability to prevent future infectious diseases. The funding structure used is similar to the one used in 2009 for the H1N1 pandemic influenza. The President's priority is to protect the health and safety of Americans, and the request supports measures to fortify the domestic health system and prevent outbreaks at home. The request includes resources for hospital and state and local preparedness, training, protective equipment acquisition, treatment units, infection control, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, disease surveillance, education and outreach, and testing and development of new vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. It also includes resources to enhance global health security by helping vulnerable countries prevent and respond to disease outbreaks. The President urges Congress to act quickly on this request.
