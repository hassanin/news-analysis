President Obama has proclaimed October 18-24, 2015, as National Forest Products Week to recognize the importance of forests in America. Forests provide renewable energy, wildlife habitat, soil health, local foods, and water, while also purifying the air we breathe. They also support an industry that employs over one million Americans. However, forests are at risk due to wildfires, droughts, insects and disease outbreaks, and climate change. The Obama Administration is committed to sustaining the health and resiliency of forests through collaboration with various partners. Forests are also crucial in addressing climate change and protecting biodiversity, water resources, and livelihoods. The proclamation calls for the preservation and management of forests for the benefit of the American people.
