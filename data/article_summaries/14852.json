President Obama announced that the Department of Energy will grant nearly $2 billion in conditional grants to two solar energy companies, Abengoa Solar and Abound Solar Manufacturing. Abengoa Solar will build one of the world's largest solar power plants in Arizona, creating 1,600 construction jobs and providing clean energy for 70,000 homes. Abound Solar Manufacturing will construct two new plants in Colorado and Indiana, creating over 2,000 construction jobs and 1,500 permanent jobs. These investments are part of the administration's efforts to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create new industries and jobs.
