In his remarks at the United Nations Security Council, Vice President Mike Pence called on the international community to stand up for democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela. He highlighted the suffering of the Venezuelan people under the Maduro regime's socialist policies, including economic collapse, widespread poverty, malnutrition, and lack of basic medical care. Pence emphasized that the crisis in Venezuela is not just a threat to the Venezuelan people but also to regional peace and security, as it has led to a mass exodus of millions of Venezuelans and has allowed criminal gangs and terrorist groups like Hezbollah to gain a foothold in the region. Pence urged the United Nations to recognize Interim President Juan Guaid√≥ as the legitimate leader of Venezuela and to take action to restore democracy in the country. He also announced additional U.S. sanctions on Cuba and Iran for their support of the Maduro regime and pledged continued U.S. support for the Venezuelan people and their efforts to restore freedom and democracy.
