This article discusses Executive Order 13547, which was issued by President Barack Obama on July 19, 2010. The purpose of this executive order is to address the importance of the ocean, coasts, and Great Lakes in providing various resources and services to the nation. It acknowledges the vulnerability of marine environments, particularly in light of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and emphasizes the need for stewardship and protection of these ecosystems. The executive order adopts the recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force and establishes a National Ocean Council to guide the implementation of these recommendations. The policy aims to ensure the protection, restoration, and sustainability of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems and resources, as well as support sustainable uses and access. It also highlights the importance of international law, national security, and public understanding in achieving these goals. The executive order establishes the structure and functions of the National Ocean Council, as well as the responsibilities of executive departments, agencies, and offices in implementing the policy. It also establishes a Governance Coordinating Committee and allows for the establishment of regional advisory committees to promote collaboration and diversity of views in the development of regional coastal and marine spatial plans. The executive order revokes a previous executive order issued in 2004.
