In celebration of National Ocean Month, President Joe Biden emphasizes the importance of the ocean in our lives and the need to protect and conserve marine environments for a sustainable future. He acknowledges the laws enacted 50 years ago, such as the Clean Water Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, that have helped protect coastlines, marine wildlife, and water quality. However, there is still more work to be done. The administration released a report on sea level rise caused by climate change and emphasizes the need for collaboration and commitment to address this issue. The United States Ocean-Climate Action Plan will be developed in partnership with various stakeholders to mitigate and adapt to the effects of the climate crisis. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Natural Capital Accounts and National Nature Assessment will provide resources and enhance observation, mapping, and forecasting to improve coastal infrastructure resilience. The administration is also developing a National Ocean Plan to promote the ocean economy, create jobs, and protect marine ecosystems. Efforts are being made to restore coastal habitats and ecosystems using nature-based solutions. The administration aims to deliver climate justice, expand access to ocean opportunities, and diversify ocean workforces, recognizing that access to the ocean's benefits has not always been equally distributed. The proclamation calls upon Americans to take action to protect, conserve, and restore the ocean and coasts.
