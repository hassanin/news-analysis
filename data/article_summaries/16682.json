The Obama Administration is taking new actions to increase access to off-grid clean energy and the deployment of innovative technologies globally. This includes launching the next round of the Global Lighting and Energy Access Partnership (Global LEAP) Awards competition to identify and promote super-efficient off-grid fans and televisions. Other actions include providing loans and funding for solar energy projects in Kenya and Nigeria, and providing funding to support off-grid electrification in Benin. In addition, 19 companies and organizations are making commitments to provide access to off-grid clean energy products and services to over 500 million people by 2020, and to prevent the equivalent of over 350 million metric tons of CO2 emissions by 2020. These actions demonstrate the commitment to reducing carbon pollution and increasing access to clean energy globally.
