President Donald Trump has signed an Executive Order to establish the National Council for the American Worker, which will develop a national strategy for training and retraining workers in high-demand industries. The council will work with companies and trade groups to create new opportunities for American students and workers, including through apprenticeships, work-based learning, and reskilling. Over 20 companies and associations have already signed a Pledge to America's Workers, committing to training American workers for American jobs. The council will also focus on increasing access to job data to help students and workers make informed decisions about their education and career paths.
