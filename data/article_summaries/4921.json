The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit took place in Washington DC from December 13-15, 2022. President Biden reaffirmed the United States' commitment to strengthen partnerships with African countries to address shared challenges and opportunities. The summit focused on various areas such as strengthening people-to-people ties, enhancing global institutions, promoting a sustainable global economy, fostering technology and innovation, improving health systems, preparing for future pandemics, addressing food security and climate change, supporting democracy and human rights, and advancing peace and security. To ensure the implementation of these commitments, the Biden administration is establishing a new Special Presidential Representative for U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit Implementation, with Ambassador Johnnie Carson being appointed to this role. Ambassador Carson, who has dedicated his career to African diplomacy, will work with various stakeholders to translate the discussions from the summit into concrete actions and explore mechanisms for future high-level engagement.
