First Lady Michelle Obama has launched Let's Move! Child Care, an initiative aimed at promoting healthy habits in young children. The program provides a checklist for child care providers and parents to encourage healthy eating, physical activity, and limited screen time. The Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and Bright Horizons have committed to these practices, impacting approximately 280,000 children in 1,600 child care centers nationwide. The First Lady emphasized the importance of early intervention in combating childhood obesity, as rates among preschoolers have doubled in the past four decades. Child care centers and informal care present an opportunity to prevent obesity, as 60% of children under 5 spend an average of 29 hours per week in child care. The Let's Move! Child Care Check List includes guidelines for physical activity, screen time, food, beverages, and infant feeding. Nemours and the National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies are providing resources and technical assistance to support providers.
