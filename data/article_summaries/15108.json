The White House is preparing for the visit of Prime Minister Noda of Japan. The visit will include bilateral meetings with President Obama, a working lunch, and a gala dinner hosted by Secretary Clinton. The goal of the visit is to set out a common vision for the U.S.-Japan partnership and alliance in the 21st century. The two leaders will discuss a range of issues including political and security cooperation, regional issues such as North Korea and Burma, international cooperation on Afghanistan and Iran, and bilateral trade and economic issues. The recent joint statement on realignment force posture between the U.S. and Japan strengthens the security alliance between the two countries. There is also the possibility of discussions on Japan's interest in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), but no breakthrough announcement is expected during this visit. The visit will also touch on issues of maritime security and the peaceful resolution of disputes in the Asia Pacific region. There is no discussion of revisiting Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, which prohibits the country from having a standing army.
