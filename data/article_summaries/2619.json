The Supreme Court's recent ruling in Texas has been described as an unprecedented attack on a woman's constitutional rights under Roe v. Wade. The law in question allows private citizens to sue healthcare providers, family members, or even friends who support a woman's right to choose after six weeks of pregnancy. This gives complete strangers the power to interfere in personal and private health decisions. The law is so extreme that it does not even make exceptions in cases of rape or incest. Additionally, it incentivizes individuals to take legal action by offering a $10,000 reward if they win their case. The Supreme Court's decision was made without a hearing or due consideration of the issues, which is seen as an insult to the rule of law and the rights of all Americans. Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan all dissented, highlighting the error of the Court's action. While the ruling is not a final decision on the future of Roe v. Wade, its immediate impact necessitates an immediate response. President Biden has directed the Gender Policy Council and the Office of the White House Counsel to launch a whole-of-government effort to address this decision. They will examine what steps the Federal Government can take, particularly through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice, to ensure that women in Texas have access to safe and legal abortions as protected by Roe v. Wade. They will also explore legal tools to protect women and providers from the impact of Texas' unique enforcement mechanism that outsources enforcement to private parties.
