Second Lady Karen Pence visited George Washington University to speak with students in the Art Therapy Graduate Program. She was greeted by the program director, dean, and provost and then toured the art therapy space, offering remarks to students and professors. She also met with current students to hear their stories and aspirations in the field of art therapy. Second Lady Pence's initiative is focused on promoting art therapy as a means of healing. George Washington University's Art Therapy Program is one of the first of its kind in the country and offers various degree options.
