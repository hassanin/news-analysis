The White House held a press briefing on February 18, 2009, with Treasury Secretary Geithner, HUD Secretary Donovan, and FDIC Chairman Bair. They discussed a comprehensive plan to help make housing more affordable and address the housing crisis. The plan had three parts: a program to allow Americans to refinance if they couldn't take advantage of lower interest rates, a $75 billion program to improve affordability of mortgage payments for those at risk of foreclosure, and additional financial support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The goal of the plan was to stimulate the economy, reduce the risk of further decline in housing prices, and provide relief to responsible homeowners affected by the crisis. The plan aimed to help 7 to 9 million homeowners and reduce the overall number of foreclosures. The officials also addressed concerns about the eligibility and verification process for the program, as well as the incentives for lenders to participate.
