The White House is hosting the 7th Annual Tribal Nations Conference, where tribal leaders from federally recognized tribes will meet with the President and Cabinet members to discuss issues important to tribal communities. The conference builds on the President's recent visits to Alaska and the Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma, where he addressed climate change, internet access, and other issues affecting Native American communities. The Administration is committed to improving coordination across the federal government to promote better outcomes for Indian Country, and has made efforts to prioritize Native youth through initiatives like Generation Indigenous (Gen-I). The President announced measures to promote Gen-I, as well as advances and commitments in support of tribal nations. These include a central website for government resources, efforts to reduce systemic homelessness, collaboration to protect sacred sites, and improving coordination and resources for education, job opportunities, and health and safety in Indian Country. The Administration is also focused on strengthening tribal consultation and sovereignty, and preserving Native American languages and heritage.
