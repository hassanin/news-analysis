President Biden held a press conference in the Roosevelt Room to announce that the United States will be sending 31 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, along with the necessary parts and equipment for maintenance and sustainment. The tanks will enhance Ukraine's capacity to defend its territory and achieve its strategic objectives. The President emphasized the unity and support of the United States and its allies in standing with Ukraine against Russian aggression. He also highlighted the contributions of other countries, such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and others, who are donating tanks, armored vehicles, air defense systems, and other equipment to Ukraine. President Biden reiterated that the support to Ukraine is not an offensive threat to Russia but is aimed at helping Ukraine defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. He emphasized the commitment of the United States and its allies to continue supporting Ukraine and called for an end to the war in just and lasting terms. The President dismissed the notion that Germany forced the United States to change its decision on sending tanks and reiterated that the decision was made in coordination with allies.
