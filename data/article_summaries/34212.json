Melania and Donald Trump send their best wishes to those celebrating Juneteenth, a day that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. On June 19, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce the end of the Civil War and issue an order freeing the remaining slaves in Texas. Despite President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation two years earlier, the freedom of most slaves relied on the Union Army's advancement and enforcement of the Proclamation. General Granger's order in Texas was a significant step towards abolishing slavery in the nation. This achievement would not have been possible without the bravery and sacrifice of the nearly 200,000 former enslaved and free African Americans who fought for liberty alongside over 2 million Union servicemen. Together, as a nation, we honor and remember the millions of African Americans who suffered under slavery and recognize their enduring contributions to American greatness. The article concludes with a commitment to upholding the principle that all people are created equal, as declared by the Founding Fathers.
