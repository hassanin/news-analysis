In an effort to combat the climate crisis, President Biden and G7 leaders have agreed on concrete actions to accelerate the global transition away from coal generation. They recognize that unabated coal power generation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. The G7 leaders have committed to ending new direct government support for unabated international thermal coal power generation by the end of this year. Additionally, Canada, Germany, the UK, and the United States will collectively provide up to $2 billion to support developing countries in transitioning away from coal. The G7 Industrial Decarbonization Agenda has also been launched to accelerate innovation, deploy decarbonization technology, and harmonize standards in hard-to-abate heavy industrial sectors. The leaders will align their long-term and short-term climate goals to keep the global warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach. They will also focus on strengthening adaptation and resilience, halting biodiversity loss, mobilizing finance, and leveraging innovation. The United States supports the G7 goal of conserving or protecting at least 30 percent of global land and marine areas by 2030. Domestically, President Biden aims to achieve carbon-pollution free energy in electricity generation by 2035, with policies supporting the scale-up of carbon capture technology and protecting overburdened communities from pollution.
