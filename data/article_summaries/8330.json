During a press briefing, NSC Coordinator for Strategic Communications, John Kirby, provided updates on various topics. He discussed the successful departure of a ship from the port of Odessa in Ukraine under a recent deal between the United Nations, Turkey, Ukraine, and Russia to ease the blockade on Ukrainian ports. Kirby also mentioned a phone call between National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, and their Ukrainian counterparts, where they discussed the enduring U.S. support for Ukraine and a new $550 million security assistance package authorized by the Biden administration. He highlighted that this is the 17th time the administration has authorized such a package since President Biden took office, bringing the total to over $8 billion in material and security assistance for Ukraine since the invasion began in late February. Kirby also addressed the issue of a potential visit by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, emphasizing that there is no change in the U.S.'s One China policy and that Congress is an independent branch of government. He urged China not to turn the visit into a crisis or use it as a pretext for aggressive military activity. Kirby also expressed concern about China's recent live-fire exercise and potential further steps that could escalate tensions. Finally, Kirby provided an update on the President's COVID-19 case, stating that he is feeling fine and experiencing no recurring symptoms, but there may be some lingering symptoms.
