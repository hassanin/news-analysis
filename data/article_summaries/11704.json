In this presidential memorandum, President Barack Obama approves the provision of aviation insurance coverage for commercial air carrier service in domestic and international operations. He determines that the continuation of U.S. air transportation is necessary for air commerce, national security, and foreign policy interests. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to provide insurance or reinsurance to U.S.-certificated air carriers if such coverage cannot be obtained on reasonable terms from any company authorized to conduct an insurance business in the United States. This approval is valid until September 30, 2013, and the Secretary of Transportation is delegated the authority to extend it until December 31, 2013, if necessary. The determination is to be immediately brought to the attention of all air carriers and published in the Federal Register.
