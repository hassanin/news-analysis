The article discusses the recent decision by the government of El Salvador to end its diplomatic relations with Taiwan and establish diplomatic relations with China instead. The decision was made by the leaders of El Salvador's governing party in a non-transparent manner, which has raised concerns about China's interference in the domestic politics of a Western Hemisphere country. The United States is particularly concerned about this decision and will reevaluate its relationship with El Salvador as a result. The article also highlights the potential long-term consequences of countries seeking economic ties with China, as it can lead to economic dependency and domination rather than true partnership. The United States will continue to oppose China's destabilization of the cross-Strait relationship and political interference in the Western Hemisphere.
