President Joe Biden has proclaimed October 2022 as National Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. In his proclamation, he acknowledges the progress made in addressing domestic violence but emphasizes that it remains a common issue in America. President Biden highlights the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) as a significant step in bringing cases of abuse to light and providing support and services for survivors. He also mentions the recent signing of the VAWA Reauthorization Act, which extends grant programs and enhances services for survivors. President Biden acknowledges that more work needs to be done, as millions of women and men are impacted by intimate partner abuse each year, and historically underserved populations face higher rates of domestic and sexual violence. He discusses his administration's efforts to address domestic violence during the pandemic, including increased funding for shelters and supportive service providers. President Biden also mentions the creation of the White House Gender Policy Council and the development of a National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence. He highlights reforms in the military code and measures to prevent abusers from owning guns. President Biden concludes by calling on all Americans to speak out against domestic violence, support victims and survivors, and work towards ending domestic violence.
