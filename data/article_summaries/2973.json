The United States strongly condemns Russia's recent missile attacks on Ukraine, specifically targeting residential buildings in Kyiv and other locations across the country. These attacks have occurred while world leaders are gathering at the G-20 summit in Bali to discuss important global issues. This shows that Russia is once again endangering lives and damaging Ukraine's critical infrastructure. The G-20 is increasingly concerned about the destabilizing impact of Putin's war. The United States expresses solidarity with the brave Ukrainian people, who continue to defend their sovereignty and democracy with resilience and courage. The US, along with its allies and partners, will continue to provide Ukraine with necessary support, including air defense systems, and will stand with Ukraine for as long as needed.
