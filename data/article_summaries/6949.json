In a speech delivered in the State Dining Room, President Biden discussed the importance of competition in his economic plan, known as Bidenomics. He emphasized that his administration has focused on getting Americans into the workforce by fixing supply chains and lowering costs, which has contributed to a decline in inflation. The President rejected the notion that reducing employment and wages is the only way to control inflation. He believes that promoting competition leads to lower prices, fairer wages, and more innovation. President Biden highlighted some actions his administration has taken, such as making hearing aids and insulin more affordable, cracking down on non-compete clauses, and addressing hidden fees in rental housing. He also announced that the Department of Agriculture and bipartisan attorneys general in 31 states are ramping up enforcement of antitrust and consumer protection laws in the food and agriculture industry. The President further mentioned that the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have released new Merger Guidelines to prevent anti-competitive mergers that drive up costs for consumers. President Biden concluded his speech by stating that capitalism without competition is exploitation and expressed gratitude for the Competition Council's efforts in reducing costs and delivering results for the American people.
