The Department of Justice has released findings on the unconstitutional practices of the Minneapolis Police Department, highlighting the need for Congress to pass reforms that promote public trust, combat racial discrimination, and enhance public safety. The Department of Justice has been taking action to hold police departments accountable for misconduct since President Biden took office. Public trust is crucial for maintaining public safety, and it is important to provide law enforcement with the necessary resources, funding, training, and personnel for effective and accountable community policing. A year ago, President Biden signed an Executive Order aimed at advancing accountable policing and criminal justice practices, limiting racial profiling, and strengthening public trust. However, there is still work to be done, particularly in communities of color where trust is strained. President Biden urges Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, and he is committed to fighting for police accountability and working with both Republicans and Democrats to find solutions.
