President Obama will celebrate the implementation of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, which provides comprehensive educational benefits to service members. The bill, introduced by Senator Jim Webb and enacted into law, allows eligible veterans, service members, Reservists, and National Guard members to receive an in-state, undergraduate education at a public institution at no cost. Additionally, the Yellow Ribbon Program allows eligible veterans to attend private universities and colleges at potentially no cost. The Department of Veterans Affairs will begin distributing tuition payments to participating schools on August 1. The celebration event will take place on August 3 at George Mason University and will be attended by President Obama, VA Secretary Shinseki, Senator Webb, and other administration officials.
