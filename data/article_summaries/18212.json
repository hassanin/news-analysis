The article discusses an executive order signed by President Barack Obama regarding charitable fundraising. The order aims to provide for a more comprehensive workplace giving program. It amends Executive Order 12353 by revising certain sections and terms. The order allows voluntary health and welfare organizations to solicit contributions from federal employees and members of the uniformed services at their places of employment or duty. It also permits annuitants to make contributions to the Combined Federal Campaign through allotments or assignments of amounts from their federal annuities. The order outlines rules and regulations for soliciting contributions and informs annuitants of their ability to contribute in this manner. It also includes provisions for local voluntary health and welfare organizations to participate in the Combined Federal Campaign. The order authorizes outreach coordinators and central campaign administrators to promote and manage the campaign, subject to the direction and control of the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. The methods for soliciting funds must clearly specify eligible organizations and provide a means to designate funds. The order does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. All existing rules, regulations, and directives under Executive Order 12353 continue to be in effect.
