President Donald J. Trump has signed the Taxpayer First Act into law. The Act requires the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to appoint individuals to positions responsible for significant functions of the IRS. However, the President believes that these appointments should be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, as the Commissioner does not have the constitutional authority to appoint such officers. Therefore, he directs the Secretary of the Treasury to approve any appointments made under the Act.
