Vice President Kamala Harris spoke via teleconference about the importance of access to capital for entrepreneurs and the disparities that exist in this area. She emphasized that not everyone in the nation has equal access to essential financial support, citing examples such as Black entrepreneurs being three times more likely to fear being turned away by banks when applying for loans. Latino and Black homeowners also face higher rejection rates for home loans, even with similar credit profiles. Additionally, language barriers limit the ability of many Asian American business owners to access capital, while people in rural communities, including Native Americans, often lack access to traditional financial services. Harris highlighted the efforts she and others have made to address these disparities, including the distribution of almost $9 billion to 162 community banks through the Emergency Capital Investment Program. She shared examples of how these funds have been used to support various projects and businesses, emphasizing the goal of creating opportunity and prosperity for all. Harris expressed her commitment to expanding these investments and building a nation where everyone has an opportunity to succeed.
