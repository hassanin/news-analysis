On January 23, 2018, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson participated in the launch of the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons in Paris, France. The United States strongly supports this French-led initiative, which aims to hold accountable those responsible for using chemical weapons anywhere in the world. The goal is to prevent further erosion of the universal norm against the use of chemical weapons. This partnership is especially important in light of Russia's repeated veto of the United Nations-Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Joint Investigative Mechanism, which is the only independent and impartial tool available to identify the parties responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria. The United States calls on all responsible nations to condemn the use of chemical weapons and to hold both the perpetrators and those who sponsor and support them accountable.
