The President's Commission on White House Fellows has announced the appointment of the 2020-2021 class of White House Fellows. The White House Fellowship program, created in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, provides professionals from diverse backgrounds with the opportunity to engage in public service for one year by serving in various roles in the federal government. The program aims to give fellows first-hand experience with the workings of the government and increase their sense of participation in national affairs. Fellows participate in an education program that expands their knowledge of leadership, policy-making, and contemporary issues, and they also engage in community service projects throughout the year. The selection process for becoming a White House Fellow is highly competitive and is based on a record of professional accomplishment, leadership skills, potential for further growth, and a commitment to service. The 2020-2021 class includes individuals from various backgrounds and fields such as the military, education, cybersecurity, emergency medicine, law enforcement, and more.
