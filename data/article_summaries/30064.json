The Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., asserts that the United States can no longer afford to be ignorant or naive in the global marketplace. He states that the US is the least protectionist country in the world but has the largest trade deficit, while other countries are highly protectionist and have huge trade surpluses. To address this issue, the Department of Commerce has been moving rapidly to institute President Trump's vision and policies. They are working to vigorously protect the interests of the United States and restore the primacy of American workers and businesses. The administration is taking action against countries that mock US trade laws and is enforcing fair trade practices. They have opened investigations into dumping or unfair subsidization of imports and have imposed duties on imports of steel and other products. The President has issued executive orders to review the nation's trade deficit and to ensure fair treatment of American workers and businesses. The Department of Commerce is also tasked with protecting national security and has recently imposed a record-breaking fine against a Chinese telecommunications manufacturer for exporting sensitive products to Iran and North Korea. The Secretary of Commerce emphasizes that the games are over and improper treatment of the United States will no longer be tolerated. He believes that under President Trump's leadership, they will be successful in rebalancing American trade in favor of American workers and businesses.
