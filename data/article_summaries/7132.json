The article discusses a proclamation issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to suspend and restrict the entry of noncitizens into the United States who have been physically present in certain African countries during the 14-day period before their entry. This action is in response to the emergence of a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus called B.1.1.529 (Omicron) in South Africa. The variant is of concern due to multiple mutations and preliminary evidence suggesting an increased risk of reinfection. The travel restrictions apply to the Republic of Botswana, the Kingdom of Eswatini, the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Malawi, the Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Namibia, the Republic of South Africa, and the Republic of Zimbabwe. Exceptions are made for certain categories of individuals, such as U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and individuals traveling for important U.S. law enforcement objectives or in the national interest. The proclamation will remain in effect until terminated by the President.
