The United States welcomes the United Nations General Assembly's resolution condemning the assassination plot against the Saudi Ambassador to the United States. The resolution was co-sponsored by UN members from all regions, showing widespread support and sending a strong message to Iran that targeting diplomats will not be tolerated. The US will continue to work with allies and partners to ensure that Iran understands that such acts only isolate them further.
