President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of South Carolina due to a severe winter storm that occurred from February 10-14, 2014. This declaration orders federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The federal funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Aiken, Allendale, Bamberg, Barnwell, Berkeley, Calhoun, Chesterfield, Clarendon, Colleton, Dillon, Dorchester, Edgefield, Florence, Georgetown, Hampton, Horry, Marion, Orangeburg, Saluda, Sumter, and Williamsburg. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Joe M. Girot has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
