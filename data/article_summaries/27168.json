This article discusses Executive Orders on immigration issued by President Donald Trump on October 24, 2017. The orders aim to protect the United States from terrorist attacks and public-safety threats. They focus on screening and vetting procedures for foreign nationals entering the country, including through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). The orders call for a review and strengthening of the vetting process for the USRAP and the implementation of additional procedures to ensure the security and welfare of the United States. The article states that improvements have been made to the refugee screening and vetting process, and therefore, the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program can resume. However, certain categories of refugees that pose potential threats to the security and welfare of the United States will be subject to special measures. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security will continue to assess and address any risks presented by particular refugees. The article also mentions that within 180 days of the order, the Attorney General will provide a report on the effect of refugee resettlement on national security, public safety, and general welfare. The order emphasizes that it does not create any right or benefit enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities.
