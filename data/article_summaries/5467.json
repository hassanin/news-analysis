On June 23, 2021, the President signed two laws. The first law, H.J.Res. 27, appoints Barbara M. Barrett as a citizen regent of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution. The second law, H.R.711, known as the "West Los Angeles VA Campus Improvement Act of 2021," allows the West Los Angeles Veterans' Affairs Campus to use proceeds from property leasing to support the construction, maintenance, and services for additional housing for homeless or at-risk veterans. Representative Ted Lieu and Senators Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla were acknowledged for their efforts in addressing this issue.
