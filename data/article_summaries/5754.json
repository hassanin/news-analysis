President Biden's top priority is to lower costs for the American people. He signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, which allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug costs for the first time. This law also caps seniors' drug costs at the pharmacy and the cost of insulin, and lowers health insurance premiums for those who get coverage through the Affordable Care Act. However, Congressional Republicans have a different vision. They want to strip Medicare of the right to negotiate drug prices and remove the cap on out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses. They have also pledged to hold the American economy hostage by refusing to raise the debt limit unless they can cut Social Security and Medicare benefits. This would put the benefits of all Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security beneficiaries at risk. Congressional Republicans have supported Medicare and Social Security cuts in the past. Additionally, if Congressional Republicans repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, drug companies will be able to continue raising prices without paying a rebate. This would result in higher costs for Medicare beneficiaries. The Inflation Reduction Act also caps the out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries with certain conditions, saving them thousands of dollars per year. Repealing the law would mean higher costs for these beneficiaries. The Act also saves 13 million Americans an average of $800 per year on their health care premiums. Congressional Republicans would repeal this assistance, driving premiums higher and jeopardizing the progress made in lowering the uninsured rate.
