President Trump held a signing ceremony in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, where he signed four bills under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The first bill, House Joint Resolution 37, rolls back the "blacklisting rule" which manufacturers claimed was a threat to American business and hiring. The next three bills, House Joint Resolutions 44, 57, and 58, cancel federal power grabs that took decision-making away from states and local governments. House Joint Resolution 44 removes a Bureau of Land Management rule, while House Joint Resolutions 57 and 58 eliminate burdensome taxes on school systems. The President emphasized his commitment to eliminating unnecessary regulations and working with Congress and the American people to achieve this goal.
