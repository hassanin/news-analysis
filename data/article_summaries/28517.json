Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price gathered conservative leaders at the White House to discuss the efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. They emphasized the work being done through legislative and regulatory measures to end the government's control of healthcare and implement market-based reforms that would lower costs and provide more choices for Americans. The leaders were invited to continue offering their ideas for improving healthcare in the country, and the communication channels will remain open as the President and Congress work towards fulfilling their promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare.
