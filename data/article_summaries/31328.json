America Recycles Day is an annual event that highlights the importance of recycling for the economy and the environment. The United States produces around 263 million tons of municipal solid waste each year, but efforts to enhance environmental stewardship have led to an increase in recycling. Approximately 68 million tons of municipal solid waste are recycled annually, and in 2018, the Federal Government diverted over 50% of its waste from landfills to recycling and recovery. The United States is a global leader in reducing waste and aims to continue promoting recycling activities that support economic growth and environmental protection.
