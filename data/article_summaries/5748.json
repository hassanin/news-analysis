President Biden looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Mustafa Kadhimi of Iraq on Monday. This visit is part of a week-long series of events with the government of Iraq, demonstrating the commitment to the strategic partnership between the two countries. Some of the initiatives that have been announced or will be announced include delivering 500,000 Pfizer vaccines to Iraq through COVAX, providing $155 million in humanitarian assistance to support over 1 million internally displaced persons, and contributing $5.2 million for the UN's electoral monitoring mission for Iraq's upcoming election in October. Other initiatives involve technical electoral assistance, restoring Iraqi universities, facilitating high-consequence pathogen track-and-trace methodology, supporting renewable energy and climate adaptation, improving public health capacity, and investing in Iraq's private sector. The visit will also address the evolution of the US mission in Iraq, transitioning from a combat role to an advisory and training mission by the end of the year. The specifics of troop numbers and capabilities are not discussed. The visit is seen as an important opportunity to discuss and further strengthen the partnership between the US and Iraq.
