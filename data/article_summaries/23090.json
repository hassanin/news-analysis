On June 16, 2009, President Obama signed a disaster declaration for the State of Arkansas due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred starting on April 27, 2009. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, as well as the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in various counties across Arkansas. Hazard mitigation measures will also be eligible for federal funding. Gerard M. Stolar was named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-4600.
