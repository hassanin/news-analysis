The White House has released a fact sheet highlighting the progress made in opening up government data over the past eight years. Since 2009, the Obama Administration has made significant strides in making data sets publicly available, enabling citizens to access information on a range of topics. Some key accomplishments include the launch of the Police Data Initiative, which aims to increase transparency and accountability in law enforcement, and the creation of the College Scorecard, which allows students to compare the cost and outcomes of different colleges. The fact sheet also highlights initiatives in healthcare, scientific research, and the energy sector, among others. The Obama Administration has recognized the value of open data in strengthening democracy, promoting government efficiencies, and improving citizens' quality of life.
