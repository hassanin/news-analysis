This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama in September 2015, delegates authority to the Secretary of State regarding the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008. The memorandum grants the Secretary of State the power to waive the application of the prohibition in section 404(a) of the Act to Yemen and make the necessary determinations for such a waiver. The Secretary of State is also given the authority to notify the appropriate congressional committees of the waiver and provide justification for granting it. The memorandum concludes by directing the Secretary of State to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
