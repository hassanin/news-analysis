Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and expressed the United States' support for Montenegro's membership in NATO. The US is willing to extend a membership invitation to Montenegro at the December meeting of NATO foreign ministers, contingent upon Montenegro's continued reforms and increased popular support for NATO accession. The Vice President and Prime Minister agreed that Montenegro's membership in NATO would strengthen Euro-Atlantic institutions, promote regional stability in the Balkans, and demonstrate the credibility of NATO's Open Door policy. The Vice President also commended Montenegro's defense, intelligence, and rule of law reforms and encouraged the Prime Minister to continue efforts to combat corruption and organized crime.
