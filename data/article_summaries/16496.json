President Obama spoke by phone with the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) Commissioned Corps who are staffing the Monrovia Medical Unit (MMU), a 25-bed hospital constructed by the U.S. Military. The MMU will open its doors later this week and its mission is to treat national and international healthcare workers who contract Ebola. The President emphasized the importance of their mission and expressed gratitude to the members of the Corps and their families for accepting the assignment. He commended Rear Admiral Scott Giberson, who is leading the team, for his leadership. The President believes that through their service, they will bring the epidemic under control at its source, preventing additional cases of Ebola domestically.
