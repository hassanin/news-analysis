Members of Congress from both parties, as well as various state officials, cabinet members, and policy and advocacy organizations, have expressed support for the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is intended to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). They commend the Trump administration for reaching a trilateral agreement that they believe will benefit American workers, farmers, and businesses. The USMCA is seen as a step towards modernizing trade relationships and promoting economic growth in North America.
