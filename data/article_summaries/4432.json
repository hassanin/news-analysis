The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Biden, aims to build an economy that benefits working families and Latino communities. The act focuses on lowering prescription drug costs, healthcare costs, and energy costs. It also aims to address the climate crisis and reduce the deficit by asking the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. The act ensures that individuals making under $400,000 per year will not have to pay more in taxes. It is seen as a historic legislation that supports communities of color, including Latinos, by lowering costs, promoting environmental justice, and boosting the economy. The act specifically targets healthcare costs by improving prescription drug coverage and reducing drug prices in Medicare. It also aims to expand health insurance coverage for Latino families. Additionally, the act takes aggressive action on climate change and clean energy, aiming to bring down energy costs for families and create jobs while reducing climate pollution. It promotes home efficiency upgrades, economic opportunities, and job creation. The act recognizes the disproportionate impact of climate change on low-income communities and communities of color and works to strengthen resilience to climate change. It also includes provisions to lower costs for small businesses. The act aims to make the tax code fairer by raising revenue and ensuring that the rich and powerful do not benefit from a separate set of rules. It also invests in the Internal Revenue Service to provide better access to tax benefits for working families. Overall, the act focuses on lowering costs, combatting climate change, and creating a fairer tax system.
