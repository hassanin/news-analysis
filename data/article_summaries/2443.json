The Biden-Harris Administration is establishing a government-wide focus on uplifting the rights of women and girls in the United States and around the world. They believe that the full participation of women and girls in society is essential for economic well-being, health, and security. This initiative is based on principles of human rights, justice, fairness, reducing poverty, promoting economic growth, increasing access to education, improving health outcomes, advancing political stability, and fostering democracy.

President Biden will sign two Executive Orders to advance these goals. The first order establishes the White House Gender Policy Council, which will ensure gender equity and equal rights and opportunities for women and girls. The council will work in coordination with existing policy councils to advance gender equality in both domestic and foreign policy development. It will focus on protecting the rights and unique needs of individuals who experience multiple forms of discrimination.

The second order directs the Department of Education to review all its existing regulations, orders, guidance, and policies to guarantee education free from sexual violence. It specifically calls for an evaluation of the Title IX regulation issued under the previous administration to ensure consistency with the policies of the Biden-Harris Administration.

These actions are particularly important in light of the challenges faced by women during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the economic crisis, caregiving responsibilities, and barriers holding back women, especially women of color. The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes the need for a government-wide focus on uplifting the rights of women and girls to restore America as a champion for gender equity and equality. The Gender Policy Council will play a crucial role in developing strategies and measuring progress in addressing gender in policies, programs, and budgets.
