President Biden commemorated World AIDS Day by renewing the U.S. government's commitment to ending the HIV epidemic. The administration is focused on achieving equitable access to prevention, care, and treatment for all communities, particularly communities of color, adolescent girls and young women, and the LGBTQI+ community. The President released a new National HIV/AIDS Strategy that will guide the administration's efforts through 2025 and aim to end the epidemic in the United States by 2030. The administration also announced the United States hosting the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Replenishment Conference in 2022 to accelerate progress in ending the epidemic. Since taking office, the administration has reinstated the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, allocated significant funding for HIV care and support, and requested unprecedented investments to end the epidemic domestically. The administration has also diversified the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, invested American Rescue Plan funds to support PEPFAR, and committed to releasing a new five-year strategy for PEPFAR in 2022. Additionally, President Biden nominated Dr. John N. Nkengasong as Ambassador-at-Large and Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally at the Department of State.
