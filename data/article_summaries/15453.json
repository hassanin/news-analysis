This article is a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, dated July 16, 2009. The letter discusses the appropriation of funds to address the 2009-H1N1 influenza outbreak. The Congress had appropriated $7.65 billion to the Department of Health and Human Services, including a $5.8 billion contingent appropriation for an influenza pandemic. The President designates $1.825 billion of the contingent appropriation as emergency funds to address critical needs related to emerging influenza viruses, specifically the 2009-H1N1 virus. These funds will support the procurement of adjuvant for dose-sparing of vaccine antigen, immunization campaign planning, regulatory activities for H1N1 at the Food and Drug Administration, and funding for the administration of an injury compensation program. The letter acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak and the need for continued planning and preparation for a national response if necessary.
