In this statement, the President announces the end of the Section 215 bulk telephony metadata program and the establishment of a new approach to address the capabilities and gaps that the program was designed for. The government will no longer collect or hold this data in bulk; instead, it will remain with the telephone companies. The government will obtain the data through individual orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court if a judge agrees based on national security concerns. Legislation will be needed to permit the government to obtain this information in a timely manner. The President believes that this approach will meet intelligence needs while enhancing public confidence in the collection and storage of information. The Department of Justice has been directed to seek a 90-day reauthorization of the existing program, including the modifications made in January, until the new approach can be implemented. The President is committed to working with Congress to pass the necessary legislation.
