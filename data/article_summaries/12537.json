In this press briefing, Press Secretary Jay Carney made several announcements. First, President Obama will be traveling to the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina for an event on the economy. Second, the President will be hosting an event to name the first five Promise Zones that the administration is partnering with to invest in and rebuild. These Promise Zones are located in San Antonio, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Southeastern Kentucky, and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. The President first announced the Promise Zone initiative during last year's State of the Union address. The briefing also touched on other topics such as the NSA review, the Chris Christie bridge scandal, and unemployment benefits.
