President Zelenskyy has been informed by the US Administration that they are authorizing an additional $800 million in weapons, ammunition, and security assistance to Ukraine. This assistance is intended to help Ukraine defend itself as Russia prepares to intensify its attack in the Donbas region. The package includes highly effective weapons systems, artillery, armored personnel carriers, and additional helicopters. The United States is also facilitating the transfer of capabilities from its Allies and partners around the world. The supply of weapons from the US and its Allies has been crucial in sustaining Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion and preventing Putin from achieving his war aims. The American people will continue to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom.
