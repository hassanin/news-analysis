President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Arkansas and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding on April 27, 2014. This declaration makes federal funding available to individuals in Faulkner County, which can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency work, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Timothy J. Scranton has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are ongoing in other areas, and more counties and assistance may be designated once assessments are complete. Residents and business owners can apply for assistance online or by phone.
