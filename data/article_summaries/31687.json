The article discusses an executive order issued by former President Donald Trump that addresses the use of United States Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products by foreign malicious cyber actors. The order aims to protect the United States economy and national security by deterring foreign actors from using IaaS products to carry out malicious cyber-enabled activities. The order requires United States IaaS providers to verify the identity of foreign persons obtaining an IaaS account and maintain records of those transactions. It also allows for the imposition of special measures on certain foreign jurisdictions or persons involved in malicious cyber-enabled activities. Additionally, the order encourages information sharing and collaboration among IaaS providers and between providers and government agencies. The Secretary of Commerce is tasked with proposing regulations and the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security are responsible for developing recommendations for cooperative efforts. The order also includes definitions and provisions for implementation.
