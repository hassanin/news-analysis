Governor Andrew Cuomo and the state of New York have implemented a paid family leave program and raised the minimum wage, which President Obama commends. This move will allow parents to care for their children without having to choose between their job and their family. Additionally, it will help workers earn a higher wage to support themselves. The President calls on Congress to follow suit by increasing the federal minimum wage and providing paid leave for all Americans.
