Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has announced the funding of 126 new broadband infrastructure projects in rural communities across 38 states and Native American tribal areas. These projects, funded by the Recovery Act, aim to create jobs and provide improved broadband access for rural residents. The total investment for these projects is $1.2 billion, with an additional $117 million in private investment. The projects will allow rural Americans to attract new businesses, jobs, healthcare, and educational opportunities. The funding will be used to construct 231 broadband projects in total, with a remaining $1 billion in loans and grants to be distributed by September 30, 2010. The goal is to expand broadband access to rural America and create economic growth and job opportunities in these underserved communities. The projects will also help bring down the cost of private investment, attract internet service providers to new areas, improve digital literacy, and create new opportunities in employment, education, and entrepreneurship. The article highlights two specific projects: Montana Opticom, which will receive a $32 million loan and grant to build a fiber-to-the-premises network in rural communities in Gallatin County, Montana, and Crystal Automation Services, which has been selected to receive a $7.9 million loan and grant to deploy a hybrid fixed wireless, fiber optic network in central Michigan. These projects are expected to create jobs and provide high-speed broadband access to local businesses, healthcare facilities, schools, and community institutions. The Recovery Act aims to jumpstart the economy, create or save jobs, address long-neglected challenges, and modernize the nation's infrastructure.
