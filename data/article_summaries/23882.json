The White House Office of the Vice President issued a statement in March 2012, welcoming the passage of legislation that clarified the Department of Commerce's ability to apply countervailing duties (CVDs) on subsidized imports from non-market economies, specifically China. Vice President Biden, along with U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary John Bryson, expressed their satisfaction with this development. They believe that the legislation will protect American businesses and workers from unfair trade practices and subsidies, ensuring fair competition. The passage of this legislation is seen as a significant win for American businesses and workers, preventing harm to over 80 companies across 38 states and tens of thousands of manufacturing workers. The legislation overturns a previous court decision that prohibited the Department of Commerce from applying CVDs to non-market economies.
