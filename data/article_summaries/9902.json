The President has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, stating that the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism will continue beyond September 23, 2015. The President cites the ongoing crisis of terrorism and threats of terrorism by foreign terrorists, including the September 11, 2001 attacks, as well as the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States, as reasons for the continuation of the national emergency. The President believes that these actions pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
