This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama in September 2016, establishes a framework for federal departments and agencies to consider the impacts of climate change on national security. It recognizes that climate change poses a significant threat to both domestic and international national security, affecting economic prosperity, public health and safety, and international stability. The memorandum directs the creation of a working group to coordinate the development of a strategic approach to identify and assess climate-related impacts on national security, as well as to inform the development of national security doctrine, policies, and plans. The working group is tasked with identifying and sharing climate science data and intelligence analyses, establishing guidance for information-sharing, and enhancing understanding of the links between climate change and national security. The memorandum also requires federal agencies to develop implementation plans to address climate change-related risks and impacts on national security. Overall, the memorandum emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to address climate change and ensure that it is fully considered in national security planning.
