The United States and Canada are unveiling a new initiative called the U.S.-Canada Partnership Roadmap. This roadmap is a blueprint for their whole-of-government relationship, focusing on areas of mutual concern such as COVID-19 recovery, global health security, climate change, and defense and security. The priorities outlined in the roadmap include combating COVID-19 by supporting multilateral institutions like the World Health Organization, building back better by promoting a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery, accelerating climate ambitions by aligning policies and goals to tackle the climate crisis, advancing diversity and inclusion by addressing systemic racism and discrimination, bolstering security and defense through investments in modern and capable forces, and building global alliances through multilateral institutions. The leaders also aim to revive the North American Leaders' Summit as a symbol of solidarity among the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
