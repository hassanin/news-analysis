The passing of Archbishop Chrysostomos II, leader of Cyprus' Greek Orthodox Christian Church, is deeply saddening. He was a man of conviction and courage, who led with grace during a crucial period. Archbishop Chrysostomos II was known for advocating for vulnerable communities and was committed to peacefully resolving the conflict in Cyprus. He was dedicated to interfaith dialogue and unity among religious communities. Jill and I extend our condolences to the Greek Orthodox Christian Church, the Republic of Cyprus, and all those who were influenced by the Archbishop's guidance.
