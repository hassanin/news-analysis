The White House has implemented the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program to provide financial relief for employers so that retirees can have access to quality and affordable health insurance. The program offers $5 billion in financial assistance to employers to help maintain coverage for early retirees aged 55 and older who are not yet eligible for Medicare. Employers can use the savings to reduce their own healthcare costs, provide premium relief to workers and their families, or a combination of both. The program reimburses employers for medical claims for retirees and their spouses, surviving spouses, and dependents. The reimbursement amount can be up to 80% of claims costs for health benefits between $15,000 and $90,000. Claims incurred before June 1, 2010, are credited toward the $15,000 threshold for reimbursement, but only expenses incurred after June 1, 2010, are eligible for reimbursement. The program applies to both self-funded and insured plans sponsored by various entities. The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program will bridge the gap until 2014 when early retirees will have additional coverage options available in health insurance exchanges.
