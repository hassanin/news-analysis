The Vice President's purpose in visiting Poland and Lithuania was to reassure allies of the United States' commitment to Article 5 and to consult on the situation in Ukraine. The discussions focused on diversifying energy sources and supplies, including potential reverse flow of gas supplies from Poland and Hungary into Ukraine. There was also discussion on the issue of shale gas in Poland and the long-term proposition of U.S. LNG supplies. The Vice President mentioned the possibility of rotating troops into the Baltic region for training exercises to enhance capabilities and interoperability with Baltic nations. The level of gratitude expressed by Polish and Estonian leaders for U.S. support in security cooperation was commensurate with the investment made by the United States. The Vice President heard from allies that they will advocate for increasing costs on Russia for its violations of international law. The Vice President and the U.S. administration believe that Europe needs to do more than just worry about the price of gas and should consider the price of values as well.
