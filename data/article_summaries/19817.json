In a statement released by Alan B. Krueger, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, it was acknowledged that the job market's problems were not going to be solved overnight. The economy had lost jobs for 25 consecutive months due to the Great Recession, resulting in a total of 8 million job losses. However, there has been a consistent increase in private sector jobs for the past 27 months, totaling 4.3 million new jobs. The overall non-farm payroll employment rose by 69,000 in May, with a slight increase in the unemployment rate from 8.1% to 8.2%. Despite the growth, it was emphasized that more work needs to be done to repair the damage caused by the financial crisis. The President's economic policies, such as the American Jobs Act and the "To-Do List," were mentioned as measures to create jobs and strengthen the economy. The statement also highlighted the importance of manufacturing growth and proposed tax incentives and workforce training to support the industry. While some sectors experienced job increases, others, like construction and government, faced job losses. It was noted that monthly employment figures can be volatile and subject to revision, so it is important to consider other available data alongside the report.
