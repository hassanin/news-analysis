On August 26, 1920, the 19th Amendment was ratified in the United States, granting women the right to vote. In commemoration of this historic event, Women's Equality Day is celebrated to honor the contributions women have made to their families, communities, and country. The suffragist movement, which began in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York, fought for 72 years to secure the nationwide right to vote for women. With access to governing institutions through suffrage, women have been able to shape their communities and contribute to America's greatness. The Trump Administration is committed to supporting the advancement of women, both domestically and abroad. Initiatives such as the United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders and the World Bank Group Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative aim to provide women entrepreneurs with the necessary resources to overcome challenges and succeed in the developing world. The administration also emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the needs of working mothers and families, including access to affordable childcare, and proposes a national paid family leave program. Additionally, efforts are being made to ensure that women have equal opportunities in STEM fields through workforce development programs and the expansion of apprenticeships and vocational education. Women's Equality Day serves as a tribute to the pioneering women who have inspired others to challenge the status quo and work towards gender equality. The proclamation by President Donald J. Trump designates August 26, 2017, as Women's Equality Day and calls upon the people of the United States to celebrate the achievements of women through appropriate programs and activities.
