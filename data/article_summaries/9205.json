Congresswoman Jackie Walorski of Indiana, along with two members of her staff, tragically died in a car accident in Indiana. Born in South Bend, Walorski dedicated her life to serving her community. She worked as a journalist, a nonprofit director, a state legislator, and served as a Member of Congress for nine and a half years. Despite representing different parties, Walorski was respected by members of both parties for her work on the House Ways and Means Committee. She was also co-chair of the House Hunger Caucus and had a deep care for the needs of rural America. The author, Jill, expresses shock and sadness at the loss and sends condolences to Walorski's husband, Dean, and the families of her staff members, Zachery Potts and Emma Thomson. The people of Indiana's Second District also mourn the loss of their representative.
