In this article, President Barack Obama issues a determination to continue the exercise of certain authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act with respect to Cuba. These authorities were set to terminate on September 14, 2014, but the President determines that their continuation for 1 year is in the national interest of the United States. Therefore, he extends the exercise of these authorities until September 14, 2015. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
