According to a survey by YPO Global Pulse, confidence among CEOs of US-based companies has seen one of the largest single-quarter gains in history, increasing by 4.2 points. One of the reasons for this surge in confidence is President Donald Trump's executive order requiring that for every new federal regulation adopted, two old ones must be scrapped. This move is seen as a positive step in reducing the burden of regulations on businesses and promoting economic growth. The annual cost of regulations in the US is estimated to be $1.9 trillion, which is higher than the amount collected in federal income taxes.
