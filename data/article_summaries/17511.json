In this letter, President Barack Obama informs the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate that he has taken action to continue the national emergency with respect to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). He states that according to the National Emergencies Act, a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and transmits it to Congress within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration. Therefore, he has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938 will continue beyond November 14, 2014.
