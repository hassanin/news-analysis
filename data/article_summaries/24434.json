The National Institutes of Health has released findings on recent HIV prevention research, stating that a daily dose of an oral antiretroviral drug reduced the risk of acquiring HIV infection by 43.8 percent among HIV-negative gay and bisexual men. The effectiveness of the drug was even higher, up to 73 percent, among those who adhered closely to the daily regimen. President Obama expressed encouragement about this groundbreaking research and emphasized the importance of using proven HIV prevention methods. The study aligns with the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), which highlights the need for a combination of approaches, including consistent condom use, to prevent HIV infection. The research suggests that antiretroviral medication may be a valuable tool in developing effective approaches to prevent HIV infection.
