President Obama announced the creation of a Joint Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) to improve healthcare for veterans. Currently, there is no comprehensive system to transfer health records between the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VLER will contain administrative and medical information from the time an individual enters military service until they leave. This electronic record will streamline healthcare delivery, reduce errors, and ensure all providers have necessary information. The creation of the VLER aims to deliver seamless, high-quality care and serve as a model for the nation. The President is committed to supporting veterans and ensuring they receive quality care, as demonstrated in the budgets for the DOD and VA. The DOD budget will protect and fund the growth of military end strength, increase medical research and development, and prioritize wounded, ill, and injured programs. The VA budget will increase funding by $25 billion over five years, expand eligibility for veterans' healthcare, enhance mental health services, invest in better technology, provide more benefits for medically retired veterans, combat homelessness, and facilitate comprehensive education benefits for veterans.
