President Obama announced the impact of refinancing changes made in October and called on Congress to act on his "To Do List" which includes initiatives to create jobs and help the middle class. The President highlighted the increase in refinancing applications since the changes were implemented, with a significant spike in HARP participation. The impact has been particularly dramatic in states with a high number of underwater borrowers, such as Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. The President met with homeowners who have benefited from the refinancing changes and emphasized the need for Congress to remove remaining barriers to refinancing. The President's plan for congressional action includes removing barriers for borrowers with GSE insured loans, providing simple, low-cost refinancing opportunities for non-GSE borrowers, and giving borrowers an incentive to rebuild equity in their homes. The plan aims to increase competition, streamline the refinancing process, and cover closing costs for borrowers who choose to rebuild equity.
