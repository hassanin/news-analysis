The White House has released estimated funding levels for each state under the President's budget proposal to expand access to opioid treatment. The funding would be based on the severity of the opioid epidemic in each state and the strength of their response strategy. The President's budget aims to provide $1.1 billion to help Americans with opioid use disorders receive treatment. The final funding amounts will depend on these factors and Congressional action. The President's Budget also includes strategies to prevent drug use, improve prescribing practices, increase access to treatment, reduce overdose deaths, and support those in recovery. Various agencies have already taken steps to expand access to treatment, increase training on appropriate opioid prescribing, and support prevention efforts. The State-by-State breakdown of the President's requested funding can be found on the White House website.
