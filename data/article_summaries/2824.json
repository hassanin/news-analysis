President Biden was asked about visiting the border and seeing the conditions in the facilities firsthand. He replied that he knows what's going on in those facilities. When asked about why the message to migrants, telling them to stay home and not come now, hasn't resonated yet, the President said that more needs to be done. He mentioned that they are in the process of reestablishing a system where migrants can stay in their home country and make their case from there.
