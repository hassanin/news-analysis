First Lady Michelle Obama has launched an official Snapchat account ahead of her upcoming Let Girls Learn travel to Liberia, Morocco, and Spain. The purpose of the Snapchat account is to encourage students in the US to follow her trip and learn about the more than 62 million girls around the world who are not in school. The First Lady, accompanied by her daughters and mother, will visit various locations in Liberia, Morocco, and Spain from June 27 to July 1. In Liberia, she will visit a Peace Corps Training Facility and a school to discuss educational barriers faced by adolescent girls. In Morocco, she will participate in a conversation with adolescent girls to address challenges in accessing quality education. In Spain, she will deliver a speech on Let Girls Learn and meet with Her Majesty Queen Letizia.
