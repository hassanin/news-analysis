The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet detailing the steps taken by the Federal Parity Task Force to strengthen insurance coverage for mental health and substance use disorders. The Task Force, established by President Obama earlier this year, aims to ensure that health insurance plans treat mental health and substance use disorders the same way they treat other health conditions. The fact sheet outlines various actions and recommendations made by the Task Force, including providing funding to states to enforce parity protections, releasing a new parity website to help consumers find the appropriate agency for assistance, and releasing a consumer guide to disclosure rights. The fact sheet also highlights the importance of parity compliance in plans offering essential health benefits, the issuance of guidance on parity and opioid use disorder treatment, and the hosting of state policy academies on parity implementation. The Task Force also recommends the development of a one-stop consumer web portal, increased federal agencies' capacity to audit health plans for parity compliance, and a detailed review of non-quantitative treatment limits. Other recommendations include the assessment of civil monetary penalties for parity violations, the development of examples of parity compliance best practices, and the provision of federal support for state efforts to enforce parity. The fact sheet emphasizes the need for expanded access to mental health and substance use disorder services in various healthcare programs and calls for the elimination of certain limits and opt-out processes that hinder parity protections. The actions and recommendations outlined in the fact sheet aim to build on the progress made in expanding mental health and substance use disorder coverage and parity protections in the country.
