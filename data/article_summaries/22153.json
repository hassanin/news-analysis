This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama on November 21, 2013, to establish an emergency board to investigate disputes between the Long Island Rail Road Company (LIRR) and certain labor organizations representing its employees. The order states that the disputes have not been resolved under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act and that a party empowered by the act has requested the President to establish an emergency board. The board, composed of three members appointed by the President, will investigate and report on the disputes within 30 days. During the 120-day period from the board's creation, no changes in the conditions related to the disputes can be made without the agreement of the parties involved. The records and files of the board will be maintained by the National Mediation Board. The board will terminate once the report is submitted to the President.
