President Obama has signed a Memorandum directing the Federal Government to consume 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020. This is double the current level and is part of the President's Climate Action Plan. The goal is to reduce pollution, promote American energy independence, and support homegrown energy produced by American workers. The Federal Government has already made progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy use in Federal buildings. Federal agencies have released their fourth annual Sustainability Plans to outline new actions to continue progress on energy and sustainability goals. The President has also made other clean energy and energy efficiency announcements, such as expanding the Better Buildings Challenge and launching a new energy efficiency loan program. The Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior have also made commitments to renewable energy production. The Presidential Memorandum directs agencies to use the Green Button tool to manage energy consumption and reduce costs.
