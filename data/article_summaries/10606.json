This article is a presidential memorandum issued by Barack Obama in 2010. The memorandum establishes a comprehensive federal strategy on carbon capture and storage (CCS) to address the environmental impact of coal-fired power plants. It acknowledges that while coal provides jobs and affordable energy, it also contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. The memorandum emphasizes the need for rapid commercial development and deployment of clean coal technologies, particularly CCS, to position the United States as a leader in clean energy. The Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency are mentioned as agencies already working on research, development, and regulations related to CCS. An Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage is established to develop a proposed plan to overcome barriers to widespread deployment of CCS within 10 years. The plan aims to bring 5 to 10 commercial demonstration projects online by 2016. The memorandum also highlights the importance of comprehensive energy and climate legislation to create long-term incentives for private investment in low carbon technologies. The memorandum concludes by stating that it will be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
