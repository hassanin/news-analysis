President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Wisconsin in response to severe storms, flooding, and mudslides that occurred from June 20-28, 2013. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in affected areas. Federal funding is available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The declaration covers Ashland, Bayfield, Crawford, Grant, Iowa, Richland, St. Croix, and Vernon Counties, as well as the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa in Bayfield County. Warren J. Riley has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
