Senior Advisor to the President Brian Deese is currently in Beijing to meet with senior Chinese officials, including Executive Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli and Special Representative for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua, in preparation for President Obama's upcoming visit to China. The meetings will focus on international climate change issues, such as the implementation of the Paris Agreement, efforts to amend the Montreal Protocol, and adopting a market-based measure to reduce emissions from international aviation. The United States and China have been working together over the past three years to combat climate change, and these meetings demonstrate ongoing bilateral engagement on this issue.
