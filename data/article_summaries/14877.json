In a call with President Hollande of France, Chancellor Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Renzi of Italy, and Prime Minister Cameron of the UK, President Obama discussed the situation in eastern Ukraine. The leaders praised Ukraine for its efforts to implement the actions outlined in the April 17 joint statement, including proposing an amnesty law and supporting the work of the OSCE. However, they expressed disappointment in Russia's lack of reciprocation, including not publicly supporting the Geneva accord and not calling on armed groups to leave government buildings. The leaders agreed to work together to impose targeted sanctions on Russia and to coordinate additional steps through the G7 and European Union. They emphasized that Russia still has the opportunity to choose a peaceful resolution to the crisis.
