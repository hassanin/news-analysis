The article discusses the visit of two Chibok schoolgirls, Joy Bishara and Lydia Pogu, to the White House. These girls had escaped from the Boko Haram terrorists who kidnapped them in 2014 and were later sold into human trafficking rings. They visited President Donald J. Trump and his daughter, Ivanka Trump, to raise awareness about human trafficking. The Trump Administration has made combatting human trafficking a top priority, and the U.S. State Department recently released its annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which estimates that there are 20 million victims of human trafficking worldwide. During their visit, Joy and Lydia read a letter to the President, urging him to keep America safe, strong, and prosperous.
