GE Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt, who also serves as chairman of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, has expressed support for President Obama's American Jobs Act. Immelt highlighted that the Council is pleased with the President's endorsement of several Council recommendations, including programs aimed at cutting red tape, improving infrastructure, increasing engineering graduates from U.S. universities, and implementing skills training programs for advanced manufacturing and healthcare. The Council is focused on both private-sector actions and government-led initiatives to boost job creation and competitiveness. Immelt mentioned that the Council has identified ten high-priority infrastructure projects that could provide immediate employment opportunities, but are being delayed by regulations. They are working with the Administration to expedite the permitting process for these projects. The Council has also conducted "Listening & Action" sessions with small businesses, start-ups, and entrepreneurs to gather input on job creation and economic strengthening. Immelt mentioned that tax policy and investment in the U.S. economy are among the topics that the Council will be making additional recommendations on to the President in the coming weeks. He emphasized the importance of urgency and collaboration in getting more Americans back to work and maintaining America's competitive leadership.
