The Department of Justice is bringing a defendant to court in New York who is charged in a failed plot to assassinate a U.S. citizen on American soil. The defendant, who allegedly directed the plot from Iran, is being charged alongside the alleged hitman and a third individual who is facing extradition to the United States. This action is part of the U.S. government's ongoing efforts to disrupt Iranian government-sponsored activities aimed at killing, torturing, and intimidating activists who speak out for the rights and freedoms of Iranians worldwide. The Attorney General's announcement serves as a warning about the U.S. government's determination to defend American citizens and its commitment to holding those involved in plotting against Americans accountable. The United States will not allow Iran or other authoritarian regimes to export efforts to silence peaceful dissent through threats and intimidation against those lawfully living in the country. The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are commended for their commitment to keeping Americans safe.
