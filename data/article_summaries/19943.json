The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a statement regarding the passage of S. 524, a bill aimed at addressing the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic. The Administration expressed its belief that the bill falls short in providing the necessary resources to help Americans seeking treatment for opioid addiction. The Administration supported Democratic efforts to add $920 million in funding for states to provide treatment for those struggling with addiction. The statement highlighted that every day Republicans delay action on funding for opioid treatment means more missed opportunities to save lives, as 78 Americans die daily from opioid overdose. While the President will sign the bill because some action is better than none, he will continue fighting to secure the resources needed to combat this crisis. The Administration will continue to urge Republicans to respond to the epidemic and provide the necessary funding for treatment.
