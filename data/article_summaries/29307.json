The Presidential Memoranda issued on April 2, 2020, titled "Providing Federal Support for Governors' Use of the National Guard to Respond to COVID-19," outlines the policy of the United States to assist state and territorial Governors in their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The memorandum highlights the need for close cooperation between the Federal Government and the states in addressing the public health risks posed by the virus. The memorandum directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fund 100% of the emergency assistance activities undertaken by the National Guard forces of certain states and territories. It also instructs the Secretary of Defense to request the Governors of these states and territories to order National Guard forces to fulfill mission assignments issued by FEMA to support their emergency assistance efforts. The memorandum states that the 100% Federal cost share provided will terminate 30 days from the date of the memorandum. The memorandum also includes general provisions regarding its implementation and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
