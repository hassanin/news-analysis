In this presidential memorandum, President Donald J. Trump determines that the United States will not provide nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance to several foreign governments for Fiscal Year 2019 until they comply with the minimum standards or make significant efforts to combat trafficking in persons. The countries affected include Belarus, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Burundi, China, Comoros, the Republic of the Congo (ROC), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Laos, Mauritania, Papua New Guinea (PNG), South Sudan, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Additionally, the United States will not provide assistance or funding for participation in educational and cultural exchange programs to officials or employees of the governments of Eritrea, the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Russia, and Syria until they comply with the Act's minimum standards. The memorandum also instructs the United States Executive Directors of multilateral development banks and the International Monetary Fund to vote against any loan or utilization of funds for the aforementioned governments until they comply with the minimum standards. However, there are partial waivers for certain countries like Belize and PNG in specific areas such as military education and training or peacekeeping operations. The memorandum concludes by authorizing the submission of this determination to Congress and its publication in the Federal Register.
