President Obama announced new jobs initiatives for rural America at the White House Rural Economic Forum. The initiatives, recommended by the White House Rural Council, focus on increasing access to capital for rural small businesses, expanding job search and training services, and improving rural access to healthcare workers and technology. The recommendations include doubling SBA funding for rural small businesses over the next five years, launching conferences to connect investors with rural start-ups, providing job search and training information at USDA offices nationwide, expanding physician recruitment at Critical Access Hospitals, and linking rural hospitals to capital loan programs for health information technology. The White House Rural Council was established to promote economic growth in rural America, and the President will host the Rural Economic Forum to discuss ideas and initiatives for economic growth in rural communities.
