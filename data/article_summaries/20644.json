President Obama has declared a major disaster in Louisiana due to severe storms and flooding that began on August 11, 2016. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in the parishes of East Baton Rouge, Livingston, St. Helena, and Tangipahoa. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. FEMA will be coordinating federal recovery operations in the affected area, and more parishes and forms of assistance may be designated after damage assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated parishes can begin applying for assistance online or by calling FEMA. Further information can be obtained from the FEMA News Desk.
