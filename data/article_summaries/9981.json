The White House Rural Council is hosting the Rural Opportunity Investment Conference (ROI) to promote investment opportunities in rural America. A $10 billion investment fund has been announced to promote rural economic development. The fund is open for business and more investors can add to the initial capital. The fund will allow a wide variety of participants, including pension funds and foundations, to invest in rural development. The conference and the investment fund are part of the Obama Administration's efforts to promote investment in rural America and strengthen the nation's infrastructure. The administration has also made investments in rural education, job growth, emergency services, and health disparities. Other initiatives include an investment fund to grow small businesses, improve healthcare quality, support rural entrepreneurship, and expand partnerships. The White House Rural Council has made several policy accomplishments in areas such as capital access for small businesses, broadband infrastructure deployment, investing in rural schools, promoting local food systems, investing in rural small businesses, promoting a bioeconomy, and facilitating job creation and economic development in rural communities. The Department of Agriculture has also made significant investments in rural America over the past five years.
