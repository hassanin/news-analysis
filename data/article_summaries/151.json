President Biden's Administration has set a record for delivering care and benefits to veterans through his Unity Agenda. Since taking office, nearly 30 bipartisan bills have been signed into law to address important issues facing veterans. In 2023, $163 billion in earned benefits were delivered to 6.3 million veterans and survivors, with a record 1.98 million disability claims processed. The Administration has also expanded access to healthcare, addressed veteran homelessness, improved access to child and long-term care, and supported education and workforce opportunities for veterans and their families. The President will announce new actions to lower healthcare costs for veterans, protect them from scams and fraud, and expand healthcare eligibility for World War II veterans. The Administration has taken other actions such as addressing toxic exposures, reducing veteran suicide, ending veteran homelessness, improving equity for women and LGBTQ+ veterans, reducing burdens and improving the veteran experience, and advancing economic security for military and veteran spouses, caregivers, and survivors. Additionally, access to child and long-term care options has been improved for veterans and their families.
