President Biden is set to announce additional efforts to encourage Americans to get their updated COVID-19 vaccine ahead of Thanksgiving and the holiday season. Over 20 million Americans, including nearly one in five seniors, have already received their updated vaccine. The President will lead by example and get his own updated vaccine, while also calling on state, local, education, and business leaders to promote vaccination. Although COVID-19 is not as disruptive as before, it still poses a threat, especially during winter when respiratory illnesses spread more easily indoors. The updated vaccines target the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of Omicron, which are dominant in the US and globally. Getting the updated vaccine offers protection against serious illness, and if people do get sick, there are accessible treatments available. The President will announce specific actions to further promote vaccination.
