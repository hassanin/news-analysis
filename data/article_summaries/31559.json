The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduces the federal corporate tax rate and allows full expensing for business investment, has been criticized as benefiting the wealthy at the expense of the working class. However, the Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers argues that this view is incorrect. In a dynamic economy, the relationship between companies and employees is symbiotic, not antagonistic. Research shows that more-profitable employers pay higher wages, and firms that want to thrive must invest in their plants and workers. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is expected to result in an average $4,000 wage increase for households. Already, nearly 500 American employers have announced bonuses or pay increases for more than 5.5 million American workers as a result of the tax reform. The tax bill is seen as providing a boost to workers and wages when companies invest in better machines and share profits with employees.
