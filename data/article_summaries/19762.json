President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Oregon, following a tsunami wave surge that occurred on March 11, 2011. This declaration allows for federal funding to supplement state and local recovery efforts in Curry County, where facilities were damaged by the tsunami wave surge. The funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, facility repairs or replacements, and hazard mitigation measures statewide. Dolph A. Diemont has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
