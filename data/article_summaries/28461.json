On May 25, 2020, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation amending a previous proclamation regarding the suspension of entry for certain individuals who pose a risk of transmitting the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. The amendment specifies the effective date of the proclamation as 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time on May 26, 2020, and clarifies that it does not apply to persons aboard a flight scheduled to arrive in the United States prior to that time. The general provisions of the proclamation state that it does not impair the authority granted to executive departments or agencies, and it must be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. Additionally, the proclamation does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
