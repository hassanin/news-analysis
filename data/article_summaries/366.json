This article discusses the extension of the suspension of tariffs on steel imports from Ukraine. The Secretary of Commerce conducted an investigation and found that steel imports from Ukraine threatened the national security of the United States. As a result, the President imposed a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on steel articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. However, due to the disruption of Ukraine's steel industry caused by the war with Russia, the tariffs on steel imports from Ukraine were suspended for one year. The Secretary has determined that the situation in Ukraine's steel industry has not changed, and therefore, the suspension of tariffs is extended. Additionally, the article mentions that some steel articles from Ukraine are further processed in European Union countries, and the suspension of tariffs will now include these products as well. The President has authorized the Secretary to monitor the situation and inform him of any changes that may require the termination or extension of the suspension. The article also mentions that the current disruption in Ukraine's steel production is part of the ongoing security discussions between the United States and Ukraine.
