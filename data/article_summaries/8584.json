Today, eight federal agencies clarified that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits certain forms of discrimination, including antisemitism and Islamophobia, in federally funded programs and activities. The agencies, including the Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, Treasury, and Transportation, will ensure that agency staff understand and respond to this kind of discrimination, engage with entities that are prohibited from discriminating, and inform communities of their rights to be free from such discrimination. The agencies will continue to investigate complaints and enforce protections within federally funded programs. The actions were developed with support from the Department of Justice and cover individuals of different faith traditions. The article also highlights various actions taken by different agencies as part of President Biden's National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, such as providing security resources for faith-based institutions, holding listening sessions with impacted communities, launching an Antisemitism Awareness Campaign in schools, and expanding security capacity-building services for targeted communities. Other actions include providing training and resources for small businesses, disseminating materials on nondiscrimination and religious accommodations in the workplace, and distributing resources on Jewish American heritage through the National Park Service. The article concludes by mentioning various initiatives and funding opportunities aimed at countering antisemitism, Islamophobia, and hate-motivated violence.
