This article is the text of an executive order issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on November 18, 2021. The order is aimed at promoting economy and efficiency in procurement by ensuring that when a service contract expires and a new contract is awarded for the same or similar services, the successor contractor or subcontractor hires the predecessor's employees. This is done to avoid displacing these employees and to maintain continuity in the delivery of services. The order includes definitions, requirements for nondisplacement of qualified workers, considerations for location continuity, exclusions, exceptions authorized by agencies, regulations and implementation, enforcement, revocation of a previous executive order, severability, and general provisions. The order is effective immediately and applies to solicitations issued on or after the effective date of the final regulations issued by the FAR Council. Agencies are encouraged to include the contract clause described in the order in relevant solicitations.
