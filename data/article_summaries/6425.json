This article is about an executive order issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. with the purpose of promoting and defending the right to vote for all Americans. The order acknowledges that many Americans, particularly people of color, face obstacles to exercising their right to vote, such as difficulties with voter registration, lack of election information, and barriers to access at polling places. The order emphasizes the need to eliminate discriminatory policies and other obstacles that disproportionately affect communities of color and to expand access to voter registration and accurate election information. It also addresses issues faced by people with disabilities, members of the military serving overseas, and American citizens living abroad. The order directs various government agencies to evaluate ways to promote voter registration and participation, facilitate access to multilingual voter registration and election information, and ensure compliance with voter identification laws. It also calls for the modernization and improvement of the Vote.gov website, strategies to increase opportunities for federal employees to vote, and measures to ensure equal access for voters with disabilities, active-duty military personnel, and eligible individuals in federal custody. Additionally, the order establishes a Native American Voting Rights Steering Group to study best practices for protecting the voting rights of Native Americans and make recommendations. Overall, the order aims to expand access to voting and combat barriers to voter participation.
