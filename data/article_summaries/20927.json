President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Georgia, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts after severe storms and flooding from December 2015 to January 2016. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures in several counties. Rosalyn L. Cole has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made if necessary.
