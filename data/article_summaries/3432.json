The strategy focuses on four main objectives: fostering openness and open societies, delivering democratic and security dividends, advancing pandemic recovery and economic opportunity, and supporting conservation, climate adaptation, and a just energy transition. It emphasizes the need for African contributions and leadership in addressing challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, democratic backsliding, food insecurity, gender equity, and terrorism.
