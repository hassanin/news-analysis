The article discusses the importance of the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) in supporting American exports and workers. Ex-Im provides financing to U.S. businesses, helping them compete with foreign rivals and create well-paying jobs in America. The bank has supported over $200 billion in U.S. exports and over 1.3 million American jobs in the past six years. It is also a vital tool for small businesses, with nearly 90% of Ex-Im's transactions directly supporting small businesses. The bank doesn't cost taxpayers anything and has generated $675 million in returns for them last year. Ex-Im has strong bipartisan support and has been reauthorized 16 times in the past. However, the Republican-controlled Congress has allowed Ex-Im's authorization to lapse for the first time in history, putting American businesses and workers at a disadvantage. This will allow China and other foreign rivals to fill the void left by Ex-Im, harming American businesses. Businesses and workers in every state will be affected by Ex-Im's expiration, with billions of dollars in exports and thousands of jobs at risk. The article also provides additional background on Ex-Im and its history of bipartisan support, as well as the sectors it supports, such as manufacturing, services, satellites, agribusiness, aircraft, oil and gas, power generation, and mining.
