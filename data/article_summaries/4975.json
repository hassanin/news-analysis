Army Corporal Luther H. Story, who was killed during the Korean War and missing for 73 years, has been accounted for. In August 1950, during a large-scale attack by the North Korean People's Army, Corporal Story displayed bravery and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. Despite his wounds, he continued to fight off the enemy and cover his company's withdrawal. After his remains could not be located or identified, he was declared unrecoverable in 1956. However, in June 2021, his remains were identified through dental, anthropological, and mitochondrial DNA analysis. Corporal Story's father was presented with the Medal of Honor in 1951, and he is survived by his niece. The United States and Republic of Korea will continue their efforts to identify missing service members. This announcement coincides with the 70th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice and reinforces the respect and gratitude for the sacrifices made by service members in defense of freedom and democracy.
