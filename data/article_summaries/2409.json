President Joe Biden has issued an executive order aimed at protecting workers from COVID-19. The order emphasizes the importance of ensuring the health and safety of workers, particularly healthcare workers and other essential workers who have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The order directs the Secretary of Labor to issue revised guidance to employers on workplace safety during the pandemic and consider implementing emergency temporary standards, including mask-wearing requirements. The enforcement efforts of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will be reviewed to identify improvements, and a national program will be launched to prioritize enforcement for violations that pose a serious risk to workers. The order also calls for a multilingual outreach campaign to inform workers of their rights. Additionally, the order addresses the protection of other categories of workers, such as public sector workers and workers in industries like agriculture, transportation, and energy. The Secretary of Labor will coordinate with relevant agencies to explore mechanisms for their protection. The order is implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
