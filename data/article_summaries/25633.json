President Donald Trump has sent a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, informing her of his decision to deploy additional US Armed Forces to the Middle East. The deployment is aimed at protecting US interests and enhancing force protection in the region against hostile actions by Iran and its proxy forces. The decision was made in response to Iran's continued threats to the region's security, including the attack on oil and natural gas facilities in Saudi Arabia in September 2019. The additional forces will include radar and missile systems, an air expeditionary wing, and two fighter squadrons. The total number of US Armed Forces personnel in Saudi Arabia will be approximately 3,000. President Trump states that he has taken this action to protect US citizens and in furtherance of national security and foreign policy interests. The letter is provided as part of President Trump's effort to keep Congress informed, in accordance with the War Powers Resolution.
