President Barack Obama has sent a message to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans is to remain in effect beyond June 26, 2013. The national emergency was declared in 2001 due to extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia and obstruction of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia and the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 related to Kosovo. These actions continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
