On January 12, 2018, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 518, called the "EPS Improvement Act of 2017," excludes certain power supply circuits, drivers, or devices from energy conservation standards for external power supplies. These exclusions apply to power supplies for light-emitting diodes and for ceiling fans using direct current motors. 

The second bill, H.R. 954, removes use restrictions on approximately one acre of land that was transferred to Rockingham County, Virginia. 

Lastly, H.R. 2611, known as the "Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site Boundary Modification Act," modifies the boundary of the Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site in Arkansas.
