Men's Health Week is recognized in the week leading up to Father's Day to raise awareness of the diseases and illnesses that affect men in the United States. It aims to promote healthier lifestyles and more effective prevention and treatment options for men. The coronavirus pandemic has posed a significant health risk to all Americans, and men are less likely to seek medical help, increasing the chances of complications. Men showing symptoms of the coronavirus should immediately contact their healthcare provider to receive the necessary care and prevent the spread of the disease. The pandemic has also highlighted the challenges to mental health, with stigma preventing many individuals, particularly men, from seeking treatment. The CARES Act has improved access to healthcare and treatment services, including mental health, and expanded telehealth coverage to enable people to receive care from home. Men are encouraged to incorporate better health practices into their daily routines, and together, we can build a healthier and stronger America.
