The President of the United States, Barack Obama, congratulates Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy on being elected as President of the European Council, and Baroness Catherine Ashton on being elected as High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The United States sees Europe as its strongest partner in promoting security and prosperity worldwide. The implementation of the Lisbon Treaty will result in changes that strengthen the European Union (EU) and enable it to be an even stronger partner to the United States. The US looks forward to working closely with President Van Rompuy, High Representative Ashton, Commission President Barroso, and his new cabinet of Commissioners to fulfill the commitments made at the U.S.-EU Summit on November 3, 2009 in addressing bilateral, regional, and global challenges together.
