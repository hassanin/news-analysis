During a press briefing, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz announced that the United States is expanding efforts to help Central American families and children come to the U.S. legally. Three new steps were announced: in-country processing for vulnerable populations inside El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, a partnership with Costa Rica to address regional migration challenges, and the expansion of the Central American minors program. Schultz also mentioned that President Obama is working on his speech for the Democratic convention and that he will likely reflect on the accomplishments of his administration and endorse Hillary Clinton's qualifications for the presidency. Schultz also discussed the Cyber National Action Plan, stating that it codifies best practices for responding to cyber intrusions and that the FBI will be the lead agency in investigating cyber threats. He did not speculate on who may be responsible for the recent hack of the Democratic National Committee. Other topics discussed in the briefing include the President's views on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the recent terrorist attacks in France and Afghanistan, and the security of the DNC's email system.
