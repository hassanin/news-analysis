President Biden has announced that John Podesta will serve as Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation, while Ali Zaidi will be promoted to Assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor. Podesta will oversee the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy and climate provisions and chair the President's National Climate Task Force. Zaidi will step into the role of National Climate Advisor and serve as the vice-chair of the National Climate Task Force. Gina McCarthy, the current National Climate Advisor, will depart the White House on September 16. President Biden expressed gratitude for McCarthy's service and announced Ali Zaidi's promotion. Podesta, the founder and chair of the Board of Directors for the Center for American Progress, previously served as counselor to President Obama and as White House chief of staff to President Clinton. Zaidi is currently the Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Climate Advisor, and he has been an advisor to President Biden on climate policy since the beginning of the administration. McCarthy, who chairs the President's National Climate Task Force, has been instrumental in advancing climate action, including setting a national target to cut greenhouse gas emissions and securing significant legislative wins on climate.
