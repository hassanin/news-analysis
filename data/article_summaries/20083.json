President Obama spoke with Energy Secretary Steven Chu to discuss BP's plans for a possible "top kill" to stop the oil leak. Secretary Chu briefed the President on his scientific assessment and the next steps if the "top kill" fails. At the President's request, Secretary Chu has been leading a team of top scientists to evaluate BP's plans and provide expert advice. Secretary Chu is currently in Houston, evaluating diagnostic pressure tests being conducted by BP. He is also helping analyze backup plans if the "top kill" does not work.
