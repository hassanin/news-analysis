In this press briefing, Press Secretary Jay Carney discusses several topics. He announces that the Obama administration is taking steps to help US businesses create jobs and strengthen competitiveness in the global economy. This includes speeding up the transfer of federal research and development from the laboratory to the marketplace and creating Business USA, a one-stop online platform for small businesses and businesses of all sizes that want to begin or increase exporting. Carney also addresses questions about Bill Daley's comments on the difficulty the President faces in being a chief executive and the first three years of his administration being "ungodly" and "brutal." Carney explains that Democrats haven't always agreed with every position the President has taken, but the main obstacle to getting things done has been congressional Republicans. Carney also discusses the Occupy Wall Street movement and the alleged police brutality in Oakland. He states that the President is aware of the situation and supports the right to free expression and protests. Additionally, Carney touches on topics such as the President's approval rating, the eurozone crisis, the super committee, the President's stance on lobbyists, and the President's commitment to the peace process between Israel and Palestine.
