President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, along with Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, highlighted the shared responsibility of government, businesses, philanthropists, educators, and local communities in promoting innovative education strategies. They emphasized the importance of reforming education to produce more graduates and prepare American students for the future. The President's 2012 budget includes funding for programs that leverage government resources with philanthropy and the private sector, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Education (ARPA-ED) and the Investing in Innovation (i3) program. The ARPA-ED aims to create breakthroughs in using technology to empower learning and teaching, while the i3 program supports research-based innovative programs to improve outcomes for high-need students. Public-private partnerships, like the one with TechBoston Academy, have shown success in advancing college and career readiness by fostering a college-going culture, advancing teacher effectiveness, and delivering a 21st-century curriculum. The President believes that collaboration between government, business, philanthropy, education, and other leaders is necessary to transform public education. The article also mentions the potential of ARPA-ED to develop digital tutors, courses that improve with more student use, and educational software as compelling as the best video games. The i3 program has been successful in securing private sector matching support and involves partnerships with foundations and private companies.
