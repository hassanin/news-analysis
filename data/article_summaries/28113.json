The Annual White House Summit on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) was held to address challenges in higher education and recognize the achievements of HBCU students. The summit included greetings from Omarosa Manigault Newman on behalf of the President, as well as remarks from U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. Johnathan Holifield was announced as the new Executive Director for the White House Initiative on HBCUs. Discussions at the summit focused on topics such as the HBCU Capital Financing Program, which allows HBCUs to increase revenue and operational efficiency through lower interest rates. The goal of the summit was to create a forum for stakeholders to discuss policy and educational issues and the future of HBCUs. President Trump hopes that through the Executive Order Promoting Excellence and Innovation at HBCUs, these institutions will continue to contribute to economic growth and advancement.
