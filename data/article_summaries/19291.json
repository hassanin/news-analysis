The United States congratulates the people of Burkina Faso for successfully defending their democracy and reinstating the transitional government. The citizens of Burkina Faso have shown their commitment to choosing leaders through a legitimate process and have resisted attempts to undermine democracy. The success of the people in peacefully resisting such actions is a reminder that ordinary citizens are the ultimate protectors of democratic governance. The US expresses appreciation to international partners like ECOWAS, the African Union, and the United Nations for condemning the events in Burkina Faso and taking immediate action to prevent the country's democratic transition from being derailed. Regional leadership is highlighted as important in upholding democratic standards and defending citizens' rights to choose their governments. Burkina Faso now faces challenging questions, and the US will continue to support the country as it prepares for democratic elections.
