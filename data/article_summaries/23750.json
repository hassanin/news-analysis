Senior officials from the Obama Administration have visited Tennessee to support response and recovery efforts after severe weather and flooding in the state. Cabinet Secretaries and other officials from the Departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Homeland Security, the Small Business Administration, and the United States Navy have been dispatched to the state. FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate has made multiple trips to Tennessee this week to meet with local officials and assess the situation. Other officials, including Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, and Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills, are also scheduled to visit affected areas. President Obama has been closely involved in the response efforts and has approved a federal disaster declaration for Tennessee, which includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans, and other assistance programs. The administration will continue to support the state and ensure that it receives necessary aid.
