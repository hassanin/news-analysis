Senior officials from the Biden-Harris Administration recently met with manufacturers of RSV immunizations for infants, such as Sanofi and AstraZeneca, to discuss the supply of these vaccines and emphasize the need for manufacturers to meet current and future demands. This meeting comes after previous meetings where manufacturers announced the availability of hundreds of thousands of additional doses. Providers and states will soon be able to order 230,000 additional doses. Parents of infants under eight months are advised to consult their healthcare providers about obtaining an RSV immunization for their infants. Expectant mothers can also discuss the maternal RSV vaccine with their doctors. Both senior officials and manufacturers agreed to continue discussions on increasing availability and meeting projected demand for the 2024-25 viral season. The Administration is committed to ensuring that every family in need can access RSV immunizations.
