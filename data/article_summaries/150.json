President Joe Biden has proclaimed October 2023 as National Arts and Humanities Month in the United States. He emphasizes the importance of arts and humanities in the nation's history, culture, and individual expression. The Biden Administration is committed to ensuring access to arts and humanities for all Americans, as demonstrated by investing over $1 billion in the American Rescue Plan and strengthening the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The administration aims to make art more accessible, elevate new voices, and expand opportunities for artists and scholars, particularly those in underserved communities. The National Endowment for the Humanities has launched the "United We Stand: Connecting Through Culture" initiative to combat hate-motivated violence using the power of art. Additionally, the top five awardees of Art x Climate, a call for visual art featured in the National Climate Assessment, have been announced. President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden have celebrated the arts through performances, screenings, and honoring artists and scholars at the White House. The proclamation encourages the celebration of artists and scholars who reveal the truth of the nation, strengthen democracy, and calls on the people of the United States to observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and celebrations.
