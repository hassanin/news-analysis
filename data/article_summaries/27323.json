The article discusses the executive orders issued by President Donald Trump on January 25, 2017, regarding immigration. The purpose of these orders is to ensure the enforcement of immigration laws and to prioritize the removal of removable aliens who pose a threat to national security or have committed criminal offenses. The orders also aim to deny federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to comply with federal immigration laws. The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to hire 10,000 additional immigration officers, and state and local law enforcement agencies are empowered to perform immigration officer functions to the maximum extent permitted by law. The orders also address the issue of recalcitrant countries that refuse to accept their nationals who are subject to removal from the United States. Additionally, the orders establish an office for victims of crimes committed by removable aliens and require regular reporting and transparency on the immigration status of incarcerated aliens. The article concludes by stating that the order does not create any new rights or benefits enforceable against the United States.
