President Obama has announced a $4 billion investment in energy upgrades for public and private buildings. The investment will save billions in energy costs, create tens of thousands of jobs, and promote energy independence. The investment includes $2 billion for energy upgrades in federal buildings and $2 billion from private capital for energy efficiency projects. The announcement was made as part of the Better Buildings Challenge, which aims to make America's buildings 20% more efficient over the next decade. The initiative is spearheaded by former President Clinton and the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.
