In the proclamation, he highlights the significance of Mount Rushmore as a tribute to four great Presidents and emphasizes the importance of preserving the history and principles of the United States. He acknowledges the sacrifices made by previous generations to defend liberty and equality and expresses concern about efforts to rewrite the nation's history and desecrate the memory of the Founding Fathers. The President mentions the tearing down of statues, violent protests, and the promotion of ideologies like Critical Race Theory as examples of these efforts.
