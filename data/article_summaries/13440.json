On November 24, 2010, President Obama pardoned the National Thanksgiving Turkey in a ceremony in the Rose Garden. The turkeys, named Apple and Cider, were 21 weeks old and weighed 45 pounds. The names were chosen from over 200 submissions from California school children who learned about how the National Thanksgiving Turkey was raised. After the pardoning, the turkeys were taken to George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens where they were put on display for visitors during the "Christmas at Mount Vernon" program. After the holidays, they were moved to a custom-made enclosure at Mount Vernon's livestock facility. The turkeys were raised on Foster Farms Wellsford Ranch in Modesto, California, under the supervision of National Turkey Federation Chairman Yubert Envia. Jaindl's Turkey Farm in Orefield, Pa., also donated two dressed turkeys to President Obama's family, which were given to Martha's Table, a local organization that helps those in need.
