The White House made an announcement about the need for health care reform due to the increasing burden of health care costs on families, businesses, and governments. Hospitals are joining the Administration in acknowledging that the current status quo is unsustainable. Americans with health insurance are struggling to pay their health care bills because they are under-insured and their out-of-pocket expenses are rising. Those without insurance often rely on hospitals for care, and the cost is either absorbed by hospitals or passed on to taxpayers or Americans with insurance. The hospital industry agrees with the President that health reform is necessary to lower costs and provide quality and affordable coverage for all Americans. Last month, the hospital industry proposed measures that could save $155 billion in federal health care spending over the next 10 years, which would be used to finance health care reform. This includes supporting policies that reduce costs to the Medicare program through payment reforms and delivery system reform initiatives. The savings align with the goals of expanding coverage, reducing costs, and transforming the health care delivery system. Attendees at the announcement included Vice President Biden, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and leaders from hospital organizations.
