This article is a notice from the President of the United States, Barack Obama, regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe. The President declared a national emergency in 2003 and blocked the property of individuals who were undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe. This action was taken due to the threat posed to the foreign policy of the United States by certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and others who were undermining democracy in the country. The actions and policies of these individuals have led to a breakdown in the rule of law, politically motivated violence and intimidation, and instability in the southern African region. Additional steps were taken in 2005 and 2008 to expand the scope of the national emergency. The President has determined that the actions and policies of these individuals still pose a threat to the foreign policy of the United States, and therefore, the national emergency and the measures adopted to address it must continue beyond March 6, 2011. The President has announced the continuation of the national emergency for one year in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
