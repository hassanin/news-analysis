The Obama Administration has announced a series of public and private sector efforts to address prescription drug abuse and heroin use in the United States. The President has directed federal departments and agencies to provide training on the prescribing of opioids to health care professionals and to identify barriers to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders. In addition, more than 40 provider groups have committed to training over 540,000 health care providers in opioid prescriber training and increasing the number of providers that prescribe naloxone, a drug that can reverse an opioid overdose. CBS, ABC, the New York Times, Google, and other companies have also pledged to donate millions of dollars in media space for public service announcements about the risks of prescription drug misuse. Other actions include training law enforcement officers on overdose prevention, securing industry discounts on naloxone and medications for treatment, and launching awareness campaigns in schools and sports organizations. The Administration has also announced investments in research, prevention programs, and access to treatment for substance use disorders.
