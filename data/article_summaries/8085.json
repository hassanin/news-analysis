The President and Vice President had a productive discussion with Republican senators at the White House. They all expressed a desire to help the American people, who are facing a health and economic crisis. While there were some areas of agreement, the President emphasized that Congress must respond urgently and boldly. He also mentioned that the Republican senators' proposal does not address many important areas. The President hopes that the American Rescue Plan can pass with bipartisan support but mentioned that a reconciliation package is also an option. He stressed that any changes to the plan should not compromise the nation's pressing needs. The President expressed the hope for further discussions to strengthen the plan, particularly regarding small business support and nutrition programs. However, he made it clear that he will not slow down the crisis response and will not accept a package that fails to meet the current moment.
