President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Maryland in response to the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area has been named as Michael J. Lapinski. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
