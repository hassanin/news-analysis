Florida's "Don't Say Gay" law is causing fear and limiting freedom for vulnerable students and families. The law restricts teachers from wearing rainbow clothing, displaying "Safe Space" stickers, and sharing family photos of same-sex spouses. This discriminatory trend is seen nationwide and targets LGBTQI+ individuals. It encourages bullying and threatens students' well-being. President Biden supports a safe and inclusive classroom environment and urges anyone experiencing discrimination to file a complaint with the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. The administration will continue fighting for dignity and opportunity for all students and families.
