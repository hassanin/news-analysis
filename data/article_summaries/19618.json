In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims April 8, 2014, as National Equal Pay Day. He highlights the ongoing issue of wage inequality between men and women in the workforce. Despite progress, women still earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men, with an even wider pay gap for women of color. The President emphasizes the need to close this pay gap and ensure equal pay for equal work. He discusses the actions his administration has taken to strengthen pay discrimination protections and calls for the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. President Obama concludes by urging Americans to recognize the value of women's skills and contributions to the labor force and work towards achieving equal pay.
