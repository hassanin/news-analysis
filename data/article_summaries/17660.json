During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest discussed a range of topics including the economy, Cuba, North Korea, Zika, the Supreme Court, and the upcoming visit of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Earnest highlighted the importance of the long-term trends in the economy and the need to build on the progress that has been made. He also mentioned that the President will meet with political dissidents in Cuba and that the guest list for the meeting will be determined solely by the White House. On North Korea, Earnest expressed concern about their provocative actions and statements, but noted that it is too soon to evaluate the impact of recent sanctions. He mentioned that the President is planning a summit on Zika in April to discuss ways to control the spread of the virus. Earnest also addressed questions about the Supreme Court vacancy and reiterated the President's commitment to fulfilling his constitutional duty. He noted the importance of Senate Republicans fulfilling their constitutional duty as well and criticized their refusal to hold hearings or meet with potential nominees.
