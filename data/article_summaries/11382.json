This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama on September 14, 2009, discusses the continuation of certain authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act with respect to Cuba. The exercise of these authorities, which were originally scheduled to terminate on September 14, 2009, is determined to be in the national interest of the United States. Therefore, the President extends the exercise of these authorities for one year, until September 14, 2010, as implemented by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
