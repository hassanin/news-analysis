The United States strongly condemns the continued detention of Gilad Shalit by Hamas, nearly five years after he was abducted. Hamas has held him hostage without access by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which goes against basic decency and international humanitarian demands. The United States joins other governments and international organizations in calling for his immediate release.
