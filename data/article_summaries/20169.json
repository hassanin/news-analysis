The article discusses the progress and plans for the transition of security responsibilities in Afghanistan from the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). The transition process, which began in 2011 and is set to be completed by the end of 2014, aims to allow for the responsible withdrawal of foreign forces while preserving the gains made in Afghanistan. Currently, over 50% of Afghans live in areas where the ANSF are in charge of security, and this number is expected to reach approximately 75% with the upcoming third tranche of provinces transitioning to Afghan control. At the Chicago NATO Summit, leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the transition strategy and agreed on an interim milestone in mid-2013. At this point, the ANSF will assume the lead for combat operations across the country, and ISAF's focus will shift to supporting and training the Afghan forces. While ISAF will continue to conduct combat operations until the end of 2014, troop numbers will decrease in a planned and coordinated manner. By the end of 2014, the transition will be complete, and the Afghan Security Forces will be fully responsible for the security of their country.
