President Obama made phone calls to Senators Hatch and Specter, who are both members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as part of his effort to reach out to Democrats and Republicans in the Senate regarding the appointment of a nominee to replace Justice Souter on the Supreme Court. He expressed his commitment to consulting regularly with Senators from both parties to ensure a smooth confirmation process and to have the replacement confirmed by the beginning of the Court's next session.
