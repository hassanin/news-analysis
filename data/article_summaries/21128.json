President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Louisiana in response to Hurricane Isaac. This declaration orders federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected area. Federal funding will be provided on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work in various parishes, as well as for statewide hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Gerard M. Stolar as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional parishes and forms of assistance may be added once preliminary damage assessments are completed. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
