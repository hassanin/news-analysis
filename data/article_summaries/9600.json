Vice President Biden called the presidents of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to discuss efforts to address the surge of unaccompanied minors and adults with children migrating to the United States. They discussed awareness campaigns to warn about the dangers of traveling to the US and to counter misinformation spread by criminal smuggling organizations. They also talked about stopping and prosecuting smugglers, as well as addressing the root causes of the problem. The Vice President also mentioned the Administration's $3.7 billion request to Congress for emergency funding to handle the situation on the border. The funding request includes money to help repatriate and reintegrate migrants, as well as to address factors contributing to increases in migration. The Central American presidents reaffirmed their commitment to working with the US to counter transnational criminal elements, stem illegal migration, receive and repatriate individuals and family units, and promote security and economic opportunity in Central America.
