President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to North Korea, which was declared in Executive Order 13466 in 2008 and expanded in subsequent executive orders, is to continue beyond June 26, 2022. The President cites the risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, destabilizing actions and policies of the North Korean government, and the threat posed to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States as reasons for the continuation of the national emergency.
