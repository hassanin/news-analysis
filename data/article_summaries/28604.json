The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has rejected a suit by House Democrats seeking to compel the testimony of former White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn II. The court stated that it is not the role of the courts to referee inter-branch disputes between Congress and the President. The court's decision is seen as a vindication for President Trump, who was previously impeached by House Democrats for resisting their efforts to compel testimony from administration officials. The statement expresses hope that this decision will put an end to the attacks against President Trump, allowing Congress to focus on working with the Administration for the American people.
