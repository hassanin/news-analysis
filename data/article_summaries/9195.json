The article expresses gratitude towards the commanders and soldiers involved in the successful execution of the evacuation mission in Afghanistan, which concluded on August 31. Over the past 17 days, the US military carried out the largest airlift in US history, evacuating more than 120,000 people, including US citizens, allies, and Afghan allies. The decision to end the military mission and withdraw from Afghanistan was recommended by the Joint Chiefs and commanders on the ground, in order to protect the lives of troops and facilitate civilian departures in the future. The Secretary of State will continue to coordinate with international partners to ensure safe passage for Americans, Afghan partners, and foreign nationals who wish to leave Afghanistan. The article also calls for prayers of gratitude for the troops and diplomats involved in the mission, as well as volunteers and veterans who assisted in the evacuation efforts. It concludes by honoring the 13 service members who lost their lives during the mission.
