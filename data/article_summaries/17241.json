This article is a letter from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, notifying them of his decision to continue the national emergency with respect to Libya. The letter explains that the national emergency was initially declared in response to the extreme measures taken by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his government against the people of Libya, including the use of weapons, mercenaries, and violence against civilians. There was also a concern that Libyan state assets would be misappropriated if not protected. Despite positive developments in Libya, such as the fall of Qadhafi and his government, the situation still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
