President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 8 through May 14, 2016, as National Women's Health Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of ensuring equal access to high-quality healthcare for women and building a healthier future. It highlights the achievements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), such as eliminating gender-based pricing and preexisting condition exclusions. The ACA has also provided preventive services with no out-of-pocket costs for 55 million women. The proclamation calls for the rejection of actions that limit women's access to reproductive health services and emphasizes the right to privacy and reproductive freedom. The week is an opportunity to promote awareness, preventive care, and educational activities to improve the health of women and girls.
