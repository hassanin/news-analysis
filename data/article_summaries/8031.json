In this memorandum, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. certifies that the interdiction of aircraft suspected of engaging in illicit drug trafficking in Colombia's airspace is necessary due to the significant threat it poses to the country's national security. The certification also states that Colombia has appropriate procedures in place to prevent the loss of innocent lives during such interdiction efforts, including effective methods to identify and warn aircraft before resorting to the use of force. The Secretary of State is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register and inform Congress accordingly.
