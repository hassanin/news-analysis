President Trump has endorsed the idea of spinning off air-traffic control from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in order to improve passenger experience and safety. The plan involves converting air-traffic control into a nonprofit organization that would be governed by a board of directors, including representatives from airlines, unions, airports, and others. The new entity would be funded by user fees, similar to how air-traffic services are financed in Canada. This move is supported by the International Civil Aviation Organization and has received backing from the airline trade group, the air-traffic controller's union, former FAA chief officers, and Transportation Secretaries. The privatization of air traffic control is seen as a way to modernize the system and provide proper funding for technological upgrades. Other countries, including Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, have successfully privatized their air traffic control systems.
