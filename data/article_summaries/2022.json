In a short statement from the Roosevelt Room, President Biden addresses the issue of gas prices and the profits made by major oil companies. He highlights that gas prices have come down since Putin's invasion of Ukraine in March, thanks to actions taken by his administration. The average price for a gallon of gas in the US is currently $3.76, compared to over $5 in June. The President criticizes the oil industry for not investing in America and for reporting record profits. He mentions that Shell made $9.5 billion in profits for the third quarter, while Exxon made $18.7 billion, nearly triple what it made last year. In the last six months, the largest oil companies have made over $100 billion in profits. President Biden argues that if these companies were making average profits and investing in America, gas prices would be even lower. He criticizes their excessive profits and suggests that they should act in the interest of consumers and the country by increasing production and refining capacity. The President warns that if they don't, they may face higher taxes and other restrictions. He concludes by stating that he stands with the American people and will address this issue further when Congress reconvenes. President Biden also mentions his call with President-elect Lula from Brazil, where they discussed focusing on the environment, democracy, poverty, and saving the Amazon.
