On May 22, 2010, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13543 to establish the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. The Commission was tasked with examining the root causes of the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster, developing options to prevent and mitigate future oil spills, and submitting a final public report to the President within 6 months. The Commission was composed of up to 7 members appointed by the President, and two Co-Chairs were designated from among the members. The Commission would hold public hearings and request information from various sources to carry out its mission. It would strive to avoid duplicating ongoing investigations and consult with the Department of Justice to avoid interfering with law enforcement activities. The Commission would have a staff headed by an Executive Director and would terminate 60 days after submitting its final report. The Secretary of Energy would provide administrative services and support to the Commission, and members would serve without additional compensation but would be reimbursed for travel expenses. The order did not affect existing authorities or functions of government departments or agencies, and it did not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
