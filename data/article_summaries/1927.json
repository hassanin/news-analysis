Yesterday, White House officials met with state legislators to discuss efforts to hold gun manufacturers accountable. The President is calling for the repeal of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which prevents victims of gun violence from suing gunmakers. The White House is working with state and local officials to develop strategies to hold gun manufacturers and dealers responsible for unlawful conduct. The meeting focused on nationwide efforts, as well as the implementation of existing accountability laws in several states and legislative measures being considered in others. The White House expressed gratitude to the legislators for their leadership in protecting communities from gun violence. This meeting follows previous discussions on the same topic with legislators in 2022 and state Attorneys General in 2021.
