This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama on March 9, 2009, emphasizes the importance of scientific integrity in the decision-making process of the executive branch. The memorandum states that science and the scientific process should inform decisions regarding public health, environment protection, energy efficiency, climate change, and national security. It emphasizes that political officials should not alter or suppress scientific findings and that scientific and technological information developed by the federal government should be made available to the public, within the limits of the law. The memorandum assigns the responsibility of ensuring scientific integrity to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, who is directed to develop recommendations for achieving this goal throughout the executive branch. The memorandum outlines principles that should guide the selection of candidates for science and technology positions, the integrity of the scientific process within agencies, the consideration and reflection of scientific information in policy decisions, public access to scientific findings, and the identification and addressing of compromised scientific processes or information. Each agency is required to provide necessary information to the Director and coordinate in the development of interim procedures to ensure scientific decision-making integrity. The provisions of the memorandum should be carried out within the boundaries of the law and agency authorities. The memorandum does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits. Finally, the Director is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
