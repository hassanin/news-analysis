President Donald J. Trump has signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum approving a new Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) policy and has established a new Administration policy on the export of American-manufactured unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The new CAT policy reflects the priorities set out in the President's National Security Strategy and provides a framework for reviewing and evaluating proposed arms transfers and approving commercial defense sales by American companies. The new UAS export policy replaces a restrictive policy established in 2015 and aims to support allies and partners, strengthen the manufacturing and defense industrial base, and promote American job creation and innovation.
