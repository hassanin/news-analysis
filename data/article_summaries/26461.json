President Trump held a press conference on May 28, 2020, to discuss his concerns about free speech and social media censorship. He stated that a small number of powerful social media companies have too much control over public and private communication in the United States. He argued that these companies have the power to censor, restrict, and shape the content on their platforms, which he believes is a threat to freedom and democracy. President Trump announced that he would be signing an executive order to protect free speech and prevent social media companies from engaging in political censorship. The executive order would call for new regulations under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which would remove the liability shield for social media companies that engage in political conduct. The order would also instruct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prohibit deceptive acts or practices by social media companies and direct the Attorney General to work with states to enforce laws against deceptive business practices. President Trump expressed his frustration with Twitter and other social media platforms for their editorial decisions and claimed that they engage in political activism. He also mentioned his concerns about mail-in voting and alleged voter fraud. The President suggested that he would consider shutting down social media companies if they were not "honorable" and criticized their handling of content moderation. He also mentioned the ongoing conflict between India and China and expressed his willingness to mediate if both countries agreed. Finally, President Trump expressed his condolences for the death of George Floyd and stated that he had ordered the FBI and Attorney General to investigate the incident. He did not comment on whether the police officers involved should be prosecuted. The President also mentioned that he would be announcing measures regarding the U.S.-China trade deal the following day.
