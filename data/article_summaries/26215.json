On May 17, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation regarding the effects of imports of passenger vehicles and certain automobile parts on the national security of the United States. The Secretary of Commerce had previously conducted an investigation and found that automotive research and development (R&D) is critical to national security, as it allows the United States to maintain a competitive military advantage and meet defense requirements. However, American-owned automotive R&D and manufacturing have been declining, with foreign-owned producers gaining a competitive advantage. The report also highlighted the significant barriers imposed by protected foreign markets, further disadvantaging American-owned producers. The Secretary concluded that the present quantities and circumstances of automobile imports threaten national security. To address this, the President directed the United States Trade Representative to pursue negotiations with the European Union, Japan, and other countries to address the threatened impairment of national security. The Secretary will continue to monitor imports and inform the President of any need for further action.
