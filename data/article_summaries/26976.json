On October 11, 2018, President Donald Trump signed into law the "Save Our Seas Act of 2018." The Act reauthorizes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Debris Program for 5 years and promotes increased safety in the maritime industry. It also encourages interagency and international action to reduce marine debris. However, the Act raises constitutional concerns for the President. Sections 206(b), 208(a)(1), and 216 of the Act attempt to dictate the United States' position in external foreign affairs, and section 208(a)(2) requires an update on international negotiations to certain congressional committees. The President's Administration will treat these provisions in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority as the sole representative of the Nation in foreign affairs and his authority to withhold information protected by executive privilege that could harm foreign relations.
