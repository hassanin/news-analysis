In this memorandum, President Barack Obama directs executive departments and agencies to enhance payment accuracy and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. The first priority is to prevent payment errors before they occur. Agencies are instructed to review current pre-payment and pre-award procedures and conduct a thorough review of relevant databases to verify eligibility before releasing any federal funds. Specific databases that agencies must check include the Social Security Administration's Death Master File, the General Services Administration's Excluded Parties List System, the Department of the Treasury's Debt Check Database, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Credit Alert System or Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System, and the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General's List of Excluded Individuals/Entities. These databases, along with any additional ones designated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), will collectively be known as the "Do Not Pay List." The OMB Director is required to provide a plan for integrating the remaining databases, and agencies must submit their plans within 90 days. The OMB Director will also issue guidance on actions agencies must take to comply with the memorandum's requirements, including best practices and databases to utilize for pre-payment checks. The memorandum clarifies that the head of each agency is responsible for ensuring an efficient and accurate process for determining whether information on the Do Not Pay List is sufficient to stop a payment. The memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. The OMB Director is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
