White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki gave an update on the US economic recovery during a press briefing. She highlighted the decline in new unemployment claims over the past several weeks and the return of the US economy to pre-pandemic levels faster than global peers, as confirmed by a new report from the OECD. Psaki also discussed efforts to address supply chain disruptions and rising prices, noting that progress has been made in moving goods more quickly and ensuring on-shelf availability in retail stores. She also mentioned President Biden's letter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) calling for an investigation into anti-consumer behavior by oil and gas companies, specifically citing the unexplained gap between the price of unfinished gasoline and the average price at the pump. Psaki acknowledged that the administration is considering a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics, but did not provide a timeline for a decision. She also addressed other topics, including the National Guard vaccine rules, Canada's criticism of US tax credits for electric vehicles, and the situation at the southern border.
