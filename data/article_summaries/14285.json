President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 2013 as National Preparedness Month in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of preparedness in the face of various crises, such as natural disasters, shootings, cyber incidents, and acts of terrorism. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will launch a campaign to build and sustain national preparedness, involving private sector, non-profit, and community leaders, as well as all levels of government. The theme for this year's National Preparedness Month is "You Can Be the Hero," encouraging Americans to ready themselves to assist in emergencies. The proclamation calls on individuals to make or review emergency plans with their families and to build a disaster kit with essential supplies. The goal is to enhance national security, resilience, and readiness.
