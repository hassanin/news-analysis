The article discusses President Obama's plan for shared prosperity and shared fiscal responsibility. The plan includes a goal of reducing the deficit by $4 trillion over 12 years, with a focus on fiscal responsibility and living within our means. The plan also includes a "Debt Failsafe" trigger that would enforce a declining path of debt as a share of the economy. The President's framework proposes a balance between spending cuts and tax reform, with three dollars of spending cuts for every one dollar from tax reform. The plan also calls for shared sacrifice from all, including the wealthiest Americans. Bipartisan, bicameral negotiations are planned to develop a legislative framework for comprehensive deficit reduction. The article also highlights specific policies in the President's framework, including cuts to non-security discretionary spending, reductions in security spending, reforms to Medicare and Medicaid, and savings from other mandatory programs. The President also calls for comprehensive tax reform and supports efforts to strengthen Social Security for the long term.
