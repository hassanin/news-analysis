This article is a proclamation by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. celebrating the life and legacy of César Estrada Chávez. Chávez was a champion for social justice and advocated for the rights of hardworking people in the United States. He grew up in poverty and witnessed the inequities in the economy that left many Americans behind. Chávez co-founded the United Farm Workers of America and fought for better working conditions, wages, and workplace protections for agricultural workers. His activism inspired generations of people from diverse backgrounds to organize and fight for workers' rights. The proclamation highlights the importance of continuing Chávez's legacy by passing legislation that protects workers' rights and providing support for Latino workers and small businesses. President Biden appointed Marty Walsh, a former union leader, as the head of the Department of Labor and created a Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe César Chávez Day as a day of service and learning to honor his enduring legacy.
