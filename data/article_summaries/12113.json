This article discusses the Obama Administration's commitment to assisting Americans with disabilities on the anniversary of the Olmstead v. L.C. Supreme Court ruling. The ruling stated that the unjustified institutional isolation of people with disabilities was a form of unlawful discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Since the ruling, progress has been made in transitioning individuals to community settings, but waiting lists for community services have grown and many people are still unable to access them. The Department of Justice continues to enforce the ADA and Olmstead, entering into settlement agreements with states to address segregation of individuals with mental illness and developmental disabilities. In 2009, the President launched "The Year of Community Living" to assist Americans with disabilities, with efforts from various federal agencies to provide housing vouchers and support for transitioning individuals from institutions to the community.
