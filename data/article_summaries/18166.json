President Barack Obama has sent a message to Congress stating that the national emergency declared with respect to Lebanon is to continue beyond August 1, 2011. The emergency was originally declared in 2007 due to certain persons undermining the sovereignty of Lebanon and its democratic processes. Ongoing activities, such as arms transfers to Hizballah, are seen as a threat to US national security and foreign policy. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and the measures adopted to respond to it.
