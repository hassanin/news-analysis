The United States has filed a case against China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) for artificially cheap loans and low-priced inputs for Chinese aluminum. The U.S. government claims that these practices contribute to excess global capacity and undercut American workers and businesses. This is the 16th trade enforcement challenge that the Obama administration has launched against China at the WTO. The incoming Trump administration has spoken about their commitment to standing up for the United States in global trade, but the Obama administration has taken a different approach, filing more cases at the WTO than any other country. Of the 25 cases filed, 16 have been against China, and the U.S. has won all seven cases that have been decided. The Obama administration believes that the success of their trade enforcement efforts should be considered when evaluating the incoming administration's trade policies. In addition to the WTO case, the article also discusses the President-elect's nominees facing difficulties in confirmation hearings and other press conference topics.
