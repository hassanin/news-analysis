President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed October 2020 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. In his proclamation, he highlights the contributions that Americans with disabilities make to the workforce and recognizes the achievements of these individuals. He mentions the Americans with Disabilities Act, which expanded employment opportunities for citizens with disabilities, and notes that the annual unemployment rate for Americans with disabilities reached a record low last year. The President emphasizes the importance of technology in enabling individuals with disabilities to work in new ways and environments, and highlights initiatives and partnerships aimed at promoting accessibility and inclusivity in employment. He calls upon government, employers, labor organizations, and the American people to recognize the month with appropriate programs and activities. The theme for this year's National Disability Employment Awareness Month is "Increasing Access and Opportunity."
