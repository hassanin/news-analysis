Seventy-five years ago, President Truman signed the Womenâ€™s Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, officially allowing women to serve in the United States Military. This anniversary is a time to celebrate the contributions and sacrifices women in uniform have made for the country and to work towards removing any remaining barriers to their service. Over three million women have served in the military since the beginning of the nation's history, with their role becoming more prominent during World War II. Despite the Integration Act, obstacles to women's full participation in the military persisted, but progress has been made over the years. In 1973, the military increased its recruitment of women with the establishment of the All-Volunteer Force, and in 2013, all combat positions were finally opened to women. The current administration has focused on addressing challenges that disproportionately affect women's recruitment and retention in the armed forces, such as updating fitness standards, improving gear and equipment options, and enacting military justice reforms. Efforts have also been made to ensure access to reproductive health care for women servicemembers and veterans. The diversity of the military, like the country itself, is seen as its greatest strength, and it is important to continue supporting and breaking down barriers to women's advancement, opportunity, and well-being in the military.
