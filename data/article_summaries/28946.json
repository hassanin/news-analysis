President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in Puerto Rico and ordered Federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane Irma. Federal funding will be made available to individuals in the municipalities of Culebra and Vieques, offering assistance such as grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. The Commonwealth and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, can also receive Federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by Hurricane Irma. Hazard mitigation measures throughout the Commonwealth will also be eligible for Federal funding. Alejandro DeLaCampa has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are still ongoing, and additional municipalities may be designated for assistance once the assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can begin applying for assistance by registering online or calling FEMA. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. seven days a week. For further information, the FEMA News Desk can be contacted.
