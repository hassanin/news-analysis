The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Office of Public Engagement recently organized a "Communities in Action" event in Rhode Island and Connecticut. The event aimed to showcase the impacts of the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and Inflation Reduction Act on these communities. Around 70 local elected officials, community leaders, labor leaders, business owners, and healthcare professionals attended the half-day forum. The officials who participated included Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Director of the Office of Public Engagement Steve Benjamin, American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling, and Deputy Director of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention Greg Wilcox. Senator Chris Murphy (CT) and Congressman Gabe Amo (RI-01) were also present. This was the twenty-fifth event in the "Communities in Action" series, which aims to highlight the progress made by the Biden-Harris Administration for the American people.
