President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring October 11-17, 2015, as National School Lunch Week. The proclamation highlights the importance of the National School Lunch Program in providing children with nutritious meals and supporting their academic success. It also emphasizes the need to address the high rates of obesity and other health issues among children, particularly in low-income communities. The proclamation encourages schools, educators, parents, and students to promote healthy eating habits and increase physical activity. The proclamation was issued in accordance with a joint resolution by Congress in 1962.
