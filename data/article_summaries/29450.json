President Donald J. Trump has determined that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic qualifies as an emergency under the Stafford Act. This decision is based on the severity and magnitude of the public health crisis, as declared by the World Health Organization. The Federal Government is best equipped to coordinate a response to a nationwide pandemic that originated abroad. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have the authority to take necessary steps to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. The President has already implemented travel restrictions and taken other measures to address the threat posed by COVID-19. However, these actions may cause temporary financial hardships for Americans, so it is important to deploy all available powers and authorities to provide relief. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide assistance under the Stafford Act for emergency protective measures. State and local governments are encouraged to activate their Emergency Operations Centers and review their emergency preparedness plans. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide relief from tax deadlines for those affected by the COVID-19 emergency. The President also believes that a declaration of a major disaster under the Stafford Act may be appropriate and encourages governors and tribal leaders to consider requesting federal assistance under this provision.
