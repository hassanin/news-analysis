The White House Office of the First Lady has launched Let's Move! in Indian Country (LMIC), an initiative to improve the health of American Indian and Alaska Native children and combat childhood obesity. The initiative brings together federal agencies, tribes, communities, nonprofits, and corporate partners. LMIC aims to create a healthy start for children, healthy learning communities, access to healthy and affordable food, and increased opportunities for physical activity. The launch event took place at the Menominee Nation in Wisconsin and included the participation of various government officials and celebrities. Childhood obesity rates have tripled in the past three decades, and American Indian and Alaska Native children are twice as likely to be overweight. LMIC will provide resources, launch online PSAs, issue challenges, and engage in partnerships to promote healthy lifestyles in Indian Country.
