Last week, White House officials, including Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu, held virtual roundtables with Native American Tribal and Alaskan Native leaders to discuss the implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. They discussed the administration's commitment to delivering federal infrastructure funding to Tribal communities, with a focus on expanding broadband, investing in clean drinking water and water infrastructure, and repairing roads and bridges with a consideration for climate change mitigation, resilience, and equity. Tribal leaders shared ideas on how these investments can bring transformative change to their communities, emphasizing the importance of continued consultation and dialogue. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild Tribal roads, bridges, and rails, improve access to clean drinking water, ensure high-speed internet access for Native Americans, address the climate crisis, advance environmental justice, and invest over $13 billion directly in Tribal communities across the country.
