The United States and Mexico are working together on security cooperation to protect their citizens and strengthen their nations. On October 8, a U.S. delegation, led by Secretary of State Blinken, will travel to Mexico City to participate in the first U.S.-Mexico High-Level Security Dialogue (HLSD). The delegation will also include Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Attorney General Merrick Garland, Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols, and National Security Council Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez. The dialogue aims to address the complex threats of the 21st century that know no borders. Discussions will focus on protecting people, preventing transborder crime, pursuing criminal networks, and promoting human rights and the rule of law.
