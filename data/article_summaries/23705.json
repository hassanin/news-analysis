The article is a copy of Executive Order 13574, which outlines further sanctions on Iran. The order authorizes the implementation of certain sanctions set forth in the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, as amended. It grants the President and the Secretary of State the authority to impose sanctions on individuals or entities and specifies the actions that the Secretary of the Treasury should take in relation to these sanctions. The order also prohibits certain transactions and donations that may evade or violate the sanctions. It defines terms such as "person," "entity," "United States person," "financial institution," and "ISA sanctioned person." The order also states that prior notice is not required for measures taken to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to take necessary actions to carry out the purposes of this order, and all agencies of the United States Government are directed to comply with the order. Finally, the order clarifies that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States, and the sanctions are a response to actions by the Government of Iran after the 1981 Algiers Accords.
