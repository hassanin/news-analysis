The White House has lifted its longstanding camera and photo ban on public tours. The ban, which has been in place for over 40 years, has been lifted to allow guests to take photos throughout the White House tour route. Visitors are encouraged to share their experience using the hashtag #WhiteHouseTour. Permitted items include phones and compact still cameras with a lens no longer than 3 inches. However, video cameras, tablets, tripods, and camera sticks are still prohibited. Flash photography and livestreaming are also not allowed during the tour.
