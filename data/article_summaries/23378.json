President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, providing federal aid to supplement their efforts in dealing with severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred between January 14-17, 2013. The declaration allows for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Michael Bolch has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made if requested by the Tribe and deemed necessary based on further damage assessments.
