This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on December 15, 2009. The memorandum directs certain actions to be taken in order to facilitate the closure of detention facilities at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Specifically, the Attorney General is instructed to acquire and activate the Thomson Correctional Center (TCC) in Thomson, Illinois as a United States Penitentiary. This would help reduce the Bureau of Prisons' shortage of high-security, maximum custody cell space and could be used for other inmate or detainee management purposes. Additionally, a portion of the TCC is to be provided to the Department of Defense to serve as a detention facility for the relocation of detainees from Guantanamo Bay. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General, is tasked with preparing the TCC for secure housing of these detainees. The memorandum emphasizes that it does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits for any party. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
