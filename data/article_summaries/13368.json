A new report released by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) states that the Recovery Act, implemented by the Obama administration, was responsible for creating 2.2 to 2.8 million jobs in the first quarter of 2010. Half of these jobs were a result of over $200 billion in tax relief and financial assistance provided to lower and middle-income families. The report also highlights the impact of Recovery Act tax relief and income supports on real disposable personal income, stating that they have contributed to the program's goal of creating or saving 3.5 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report emphasizes the positive effect of bolstering the purchasing power of middle-class families and mentions the various tax benefits available through the Recovery Act, such as the First-Time Homebuyer Credit and the Making Work Pay tax credit. The report concludes by highlighting the economic growth and job gains achieved since the implementation of the Recovery Act.
