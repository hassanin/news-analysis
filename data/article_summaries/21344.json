The article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by Barack Obama on December 20, 2016. The memorandum directs the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw certain areas off the Atlantic Coast on the Outer Continental Shelf from mineral leasing. This action is taken to ensure the protection of canyons along the edge of the Atlantic continental shelf, which are important for marine mammals, deep water corals, and other wildlife habitats. The withdrawal prevents any future consideration of this area for mineral leasing, but does not affect existing leases.
