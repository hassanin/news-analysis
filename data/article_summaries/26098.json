June's jobs report exceeded expectations, with the U.S. economy adding 224,000 jobs, the highest gain since January. The unemployment rate edged up to 3.7% as labor force participation rose. Economists believe the labor market is "roaring back" and that the increase in the unemployment rate is a reflection of the rise in the participation rate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all reached record highs. Small-business optimism also rose to a seven-month high, and consumer sentiment reached its highest level in 18 years. Hispanic women have seen the biggest increase in employment rates, followed by black women. Manufacturing activity in June was stronger than expected, and retail sales improved, with increases in purchases of motor vehicles, building materials, and online shopping.
