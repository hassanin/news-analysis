President Donald J. Trump has issued two proclamations authorizing modifications of the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum. The Administration has reached a final agreement with South Korea on steel imports, and agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil. Negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union have been extended for a final 30 days. The Administration's focus in these negotiations is on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment, and protect national security. These agreements highlight the Trump Administration's strategy to protect national security and address global challenges to the steel and aluminum industries.
