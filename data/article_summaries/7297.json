The White House Office of Public Engagement and National Economic Council recently hosted a meeting with the U.S. Black Chambers, Inc. (USBC) to discuss President Biden's economic plan, known as Bidenomics. The President made a surprise visit to thank the group of over 80 leaders and highlighted the progress being made in the economy, including job creation, low Black unemployment rates, and increased Black labor force participation. However, he also acknowledged the need for further efforts to ensure equitable growth and wealth creation for communities of color. Administration officials reiterated the commitment to sustainable economic growth and inclusive wealth building, and provided updates on initiatives to improve access to capital, increase government contracting for Black entrepreneurs, and advance the President's equity policy agenda.
