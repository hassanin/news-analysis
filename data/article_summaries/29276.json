The U.S. economy has added 11.4 million new jobs since May, defying predictions of high unemployment rates and continued job losses. The Council of Economic Advisers claims that President Trump has led the fastest economic recovery in American history. This is attributed to Trump's pro-growth, pro-worker agenda and targeted actions taken to help American workers and families during the pandemic. The Trump Administration negotiated the CARES Act, implemented the Paycheck Protection Program, extended unemployment benefits, paused student loan payments, and halted evictions. The Administration has also tightened requirements on foreign worker visas to protect American jobs. Despite Democrats' lack of support for targeted relief, Trump remains focused on prioritizing American workers and families. The article emphasizes that the real-world impact on Americans is more important than partisan gossip from newsrooms. The recovery the U.S. is experiencing is almost 41 times faster than previous recoveries, according to the Council of Economic Advisers.
