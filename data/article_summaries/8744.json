President Biden's Special Advisor for the Americas, Christopher Dodd, and Commander of the United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), General Laura Richardson, met with President of Ecuador, Daniel Noboa, to demonstrate US support for the country in response to a surge in violence. The discussions focused on the commitment to democratic values and the rule of law, as well as ways to enhance bilateral cooperation in security, counter-drug efforts, migration, and economic development. The US is facilitating the delivery of bulletproof vests, security, and emergency response equipment worth over $1 million. The FBI will increase its personnel in Ecuador to support the Ecuadorian National Police and Attorney General's Office, and the Department of Homeland Security is deploying personnel to aid in training police and prosecutors. The US will also provide support in digital forensics and analysis, as well as training and technical assistance for the protection of executive officials. USAID will augment its support for municipal security programs and crisis communications. Additionally, the US, Ecuador, and other regional partners are working together under the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity initiative to provide greater economic opportunities for Ecuadorians, addressing the underlying causes of insecurity, criminality, and migration.
