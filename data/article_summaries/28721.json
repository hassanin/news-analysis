President Donald J. Trump has directed departments and agencies to review laws, regulations, and policies in order to propose changes that would minimize the procurement of goods and services from the People's Republic of China (PRC) by the Federal Government. The PRC's 2017 National Intelligence Law requires individuals, organizations, and institutions to assist the PRC security and intelligence services in intelligence work. The PRC government, under the Chinese Communist Party, has the ability to coerce and coopt PRC manufacturers and service providers for espionage and information advantage. This aligns with the PRC's Military-Civil Fusion (MCF) strategy, which aims to advance the capabilities of the PRC military through the acquisition of critical technologies. The Director of National Intelligence has identified the PRC as the greatest national security threat to America, as Beijing views the United States as an obstacle to its regional and global ambitions. The PRC targets the information systems of the US Government for exploitable data through cyber and other means. Therefore, the United States must take action to protect its interests by adjusting regulations, policies, and implementing other necessary measures to reduce the risk of PRC espionage activities directed at the Federal Government. President Trump has taken steps to address this issue.
