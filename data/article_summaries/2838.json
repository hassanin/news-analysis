Eleven years ago, President Obama and the speaker of the article announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. This program allows young people who have lived in the United States their entire lives to work and live legally. Over 800,000 Dreamers have benefited from DACA, using their skills and talents to contribute to their communities. Dreamers are Americans who have spent most of their lives in the United States, and they are doctors, teachers, and small business owners. They strengthen the economy and have even served on the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for Dreamers, has been introduced to Congress multiple times over the past twenty years but has not been passed. The current administration is committed to supporting Dreamers and expanding health coverage for them. However, only Congress can provide permanent stability and a path to citizenship for these young people and their families. The article concludes by urging Congress to take action to protect Dreamers.
