The article discusses the efforts of the United States, under President Obama, to combat climate change and transition to a clean energy economy. In July 2009, President Obama launched the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, which brought together 17 developed and developing economies to discuss clean energy technology and work towards an international agreement on climate change. The forum focused on pillars such as mitigation, adaptation, finance, and technology. The leaders agreed to reduce emissions, establish a global partnership for low-carbon technologies, double investments in research and development, and develop action plans and roadmaps for progress. They also emphasized the need for financing, particularly to assist the poorest and most vulnerable countries in adapting to climate change. The participating countries included Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Denmark and the United Nations also participated in the dialogue.
