In this memorandum, President Barack Obama emphasizes the importance of reducing payment errors and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. The memorandum directs executive departments and agencies to use all available tools to identify and recapture funds associated with improper payments. The use of "Payment Recapture Audits" is encouraged as an effective mechanism for detecting and recapturing payment errors. These audits involve skilled accounting specialists and fraud examiners using advanced tools to examine payment records and uncover issues such as duplicate payments, payments for services not rendered, overpayments, and fictitious vendors. The memorandum also suggests using professional auditors on a contingency basis, with their compensation tied to the identification of misspent funds. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is tasked with developing guidance within 90 days to ensure compliance with the memorandum. The OMB will also coordinate with the Council for Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency to assess the effectiveness of agency efforts. It is important to note that this memorandum does not require the disclosure of classified or sensitive information and does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits. The Director of the OMB is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
