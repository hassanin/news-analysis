The article is a message from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe will continue beyond its anniversary date. The national emergency was declared in 2003 due to actions and policies of certain members of the Zimbabwean government and other individuals that undermine the country's democratic processes or institutions. The threat posed by these actions and policies is still ongoing and continues to be a concern for the United States' foreign policy. Therefore, President Barack Obama has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency and keep the sanctions in place to address this threat.
