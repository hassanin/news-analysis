Yesterday, Vice President Harris and EPA Administrator Regan announced that 389 school districts from across all 50 states and U.S. territories will receive nearly $1 billion from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to replace old diesel school buses with new clean school buses. The electric school buses will help reduce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and protect children’s health. Additionally, the program will boost demand for American-made batteries and vehicles, create union jobs, and support domestic manufacturing. The announcement has received praise from political, business, and advocacy leaders across the country, who see it as a significant step towards a cleaner and healthier future for American children.
