President Obama has announced that America's high school graduation rate has reached a new high of 83.2 percent. This represents a four percentage point increase since the 2010-2011 school year. The increase reflects progress made by schools across the country in preparing students for college and careers. The graduation rates for all reported groups of students, including students of color, low-income students, students with disabilities, and English learners, have also shown improvement. The District of Columbia has made the greatest progress in the nation, with a seven percentage point increase in graduation rates since 2013-2014. The Obama Administration has invested in various initiatives to improve education, including expanding access to preschool, implementing college and career-ready standards, increasing high-speed broadband in schools, promoting STEM and computer science education, supporting teachers and leaders, and making college more affordable. The administration has also introduced the College Scorecard, a tool that provides data on college costs, graduation rates, debt, and post-college earnings to help students and families make informed decisions. Additionally, the President has proposed making community college free for responsible students through the America's College Promise plan.
