During a recent press conference, Acting Administrator Slavitt provided an update on the progress of the national strategy to defeat COVID-19. Key points from the briefing include:

1. Vaccinations: The administration has significantly increased vaccine production and distribution. The goal is to have all Americans eligible for the vaccine by May 1st. Currently, the U.S. is administering about 2.5 million vaccine doses per day.

2. School reopening: The administration is prioritizing the safe reopening of schools by following scientific guidelines, increasing testing, and vaccinating teachers. $10 billion has been allocated for testing in schools.

3. Community vaccination sites: The federal government has opened 22 community vaccination sites, delivering nearly 100,000 shots per day. These sites are located in areas with high social vulnerability ratings and have prioritized equitable vaccine distribution.

4. COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations: The seven-day average for new cases and hospital admissions has remained relatively stable over the past two weeks, with slight increases. However, deaths continue to decline, but at a slower rate.

5. Variants of concern: Variants such as B1427/B1429 and B117 are becoming more prevalent in certain states, raising concerns about the spread of these more transmissible variants.

6. AstraZeneca vaccine: Results from the AstraZeneca phase three trial were announced, showing a vaccine efficacy of 78.9% in preventing symptomatic disease. The vaccine was well-tolerated with no safety concerns identified.

Regarding future plans, the administration is closely monitoring vaccine supply and working with manufacturers to ensure timely delivery. The FDA will conduct a thorough review of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and the administration will continue to address vaccine hesitancy and provide updated guidance for vaccinated individuals, including travel recommendations.
