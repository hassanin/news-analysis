In a speech delivered in the East Room of the White House, President Trump declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency under federal law. He highlighted the severity of the crisis, stating that last year alone, at least 64,000 Americans died from drug overdoses, with drug overdoses becoming the leading cause of unintentional death in the United States. President Trump emphasized the need for a comprehensive effort to address the crisis, including prevention, treatment, and law enforcement measures. He announced several actions that his administration will take, including lifting a 1970s-era rule that limits the number of beds in certain treatment facilities, launching an advertising campaign to discourage drug use, and increasing access to life-saving overdose medications. President Trump also stressed the importance of addressing the demand for drugs and reducing addiction rates, as well as the need for cooperation with other countries to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. He concluded his speech by calling on all Americans to join the fight against the opioid crisis.
