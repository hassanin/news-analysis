This article is a fact sheet released by the White House Office of the Press Secretary regarding the progress on mental health services for veterans. It discusses the Vet Centers, which are community-based counseling centers that provide counseling services to veterans, active duty servicemembers, and their families. These centers have non-traditional hours, such as evenings and weekends, to ensure accessibility. The Vet Centers also prioritize Veteran-to-Veteran connections, as the majority of their staff are veterans themselves. There are 300 Vet Centers across the United States and its territories, and there are also Mobile Vet Centers that provide services to rural communities. The article emphasizes that all services are available without time limitation and at no cost, and veterans and servicemembers do not need to be enrolled with the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) or have a disability rating to access these services. The article also mentions the steps taken by the VA and the Department of Defense (DoD) to improve mental health care for servicemembers, such as the inTransition program that connects servicemembers receiving mental health care to mental health professionals as they transition to the VA or a community provider. The article concludes by highlighting the ongoing efforts of the Administration to improve mental health services for veterans, including the allocation of over $7 billion in the 2016 budget for mental health services. It also mentions various initiatives and programs aimed at suicide prevention and increasing access to mental health care.
