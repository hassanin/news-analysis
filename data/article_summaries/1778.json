Yesterday, Lael Brainard, Assistant to the President and National Economic Advisor, held a meeting with stakeholders to discuss the Biden-Harris Administration's support for AI policy that promotes fair and competitive markets. The participants focused on the risks of concentration in the AI ecosystem and ways to support competition as AI systems continue to develop. They discussed concerns about high levels of concentration in critical inputs such as semiconductors, computing power, cloud storage, talent, and data. The participants also addressed the possible harms of lack of competition in AI, including issues with prices, quality, innovation, and privacy. They also discussed how the rise of AI will impact competition law and policy, including challenges like price-fixing and self-preferencing. The meeting concluded with a discussion on steps the Administration can take to promote competition and ensure the benefits of AI are more widely available, such as supporting publicly-funded research initiatives and effective use of procurement tools. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to promoting competition and innovation in AI, as stated in President Biden's Executive Order on AI and related technologies. Representatives from various government agencies and outside participants attended the meeting.
