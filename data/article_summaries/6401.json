In a recent press conference at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, President Biden was asked about the possibility of attacking servers used in Russia to carry out ransom attacks. The President responded by stating that while there was one company that was attacked, the focus was on attacking businesses rather than specific servers. When asked if it made sense for the US to attack the actual servers, President Biden simply answered "yes." He also mentioned that a joint committee has been set up to address cyberattacks and that cooperation is expected. When asked about the consequences for Putin if he does not take action against cyberattacks, President Biden did not provide a direct answer, stating that it is not appropriate for him to say what he expects Putin to do at this time.
