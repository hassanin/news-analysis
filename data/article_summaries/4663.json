President Biden has announced his intent to appoint several individuals to serve as members on the President's Advisory Committee on the Arts (PACA). Established in 1958, PACA has played a vital role in sustaining the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The committee consists of civic and cultural leaders who are selected by the President to serve as representatives in their own communities. The members of PACA are considered "Ambassadors for the Arts" and help broaden the influence and vision of the Kennedy Center across the country. The committee serves as a national forum, allowing its members to share their views on the Center's artistic programming. The appointed members include Eugene William Stetson III, Andi Bernstein, Christopher Carrera, Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, Barbara Gamson, Melissa Hedden, Lorna Johnson, Bonnie Lautenberg, Allison Putala, Sunil Puri, Charlie Pohlad, Diane Robertson, Thomas Safran, and Andrew Tavakoli. Each member brings a diverse range of experiences and expertise in fields such as film production, finance, media, technology, entrepreneurship, philanthropy, and more.
