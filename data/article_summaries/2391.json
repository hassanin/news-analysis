Vice President Kamala Harris has addressed the issue of migration from Central America in a cover message. She emphasizes that the root causes of migration must be addressed in order to effectively manage immigration. The Biden administration has restarted engagement with Central American governments and developed a comprehensive Root Causes Strategy based on four core pieces of evidence. 

First, addressing the root causes of migration is crucial for overall immigration efforts. President Biden's vision includes reforming the immigration system, creating a pathway to citizenship, and effectively managing the border. Harris has been tasked with leading efforts to address the root causes.

Second, providing relief alone is not enough to stem migration. The COVID-19 pandemic and extreme weather conditions have worsened the root causes, such as corruption, violence, trafficking, and poverty. While relief efforts have been made, long-term solutions are necessary.

Third, all root causes must be addressed to solve the problem. Harris highlights corruption as a major challenge in Guatemala and announces the launch of an Anticorruption Task Force involving U.S. prosecutors and law enforcement experts. By tackling corruption, economic and educational opportunities can be improved.

Fourth, the United States cannot address these issues alone. The strategy focuses on partnerships with other governments, international institutions, businesses, foundations, and civil society. Commitments have already been received from Mexico, Japan, Korea, and the United Nations. The private sector is also being called upon to invest in the region.

The administration's goal is to consistently engage with the region, building on what works and pivoting away from ineffective approaches. The implementation of strategies like this is crucial for the strength and security of the United States.
