Karen Pence, the Second Lady, visited Nemours Children's Hospital in Central Florida to observe an individual music therapy session. The hospital, which is only five years old, has incorporated music therapy into their treatment program. During the session, a young patient named Maya played the keyboard while Mrs. Pence helped with percussion. Unbeknownst to them, the music therapy session was actually helping Maya manage her pain. Maya shared that the sessions have been helpful in dealing with her pain, and she can use the keyboard in her room whenever she feels pain. Maya's mother also expressed that the therapy has been particularly beneficial for her daughter, and Maya looks forward to using the family piano when she goes home. Karen Pence is passionate about art therapy and hopes to use her platform to raise awareness about it. She invites people to follow her journey as she shares stories about her visits across the United States and around the world to promote art therapy.
