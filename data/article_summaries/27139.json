President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 with respect to Yemen will continue beyond May 16, 2019. The President cites the actions and policies of certain former members of the Yemeni government and others as threats to Yemen's peace, security, and stability, including the obstruction of the political process and the implementation of the November 23, 2011 agreement. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
