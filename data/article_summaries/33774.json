Vice President Mike Pence and Second Lady Karen Pence concluded their third day in Asia by visiting the Cheonan Memorial, meeting with North Korean defectors, and attending the opening ceremony of the 2018 Olympic Winter Games. At the memorial, they saw a ship that was attacked by a North Korean torpedo in 2010. Despite international confirmation of North Korea's involvement, the country continues to deny responsibility for the incident. The Vice President also met with victims of the oppressive North Korean regime, including defectors who shared their harrowing stories. They also heard from Fred Warmbier, father of Otto Warmbier, an American student who was imprisoned in North Korea and died shortly after his release. The Pence's trip aims to raise awareness about the cruelty and tyranny of the North Korean regime. They then flew to Pyeongchang to lead the US delegation at the Olympic Winter Games. This is Vice President Pence's second visit to Japan and South Korea in less than a year.
