President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Minnesota and has ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms, flooding, and tornadoes that occurred from July 1-11, 2011. The declaration allows for federal funding to be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures in various counties and Indian Tribes within the state. Lawrence Sommers has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
