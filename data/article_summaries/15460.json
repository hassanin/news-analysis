President Obama has declared a major disaster in Massachusetts due to the effects of Tropical Storm Irene. This declaration allows federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in Berkshire and Franklin counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. Further information can be obtained from the FEMA news desk.
