Anne Hazlett has been appointed as the Senior Adviser for Rural Affairs in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). Hazlett, who previously served as the Assistant to the Secretary for Rural Development at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), will be responsible for shaping policies to improve the quality of life in rural America and coordinating interagency efforts on drug control activities in rural communities. She will also focus on prevention, treatment, and recovery strategies. Hazlett's appointment comes as rural communities have been heavily impacted by the opioid crisis. During her time at USDA, Hazlett led efforts to build infrastructure for prevention, treatment, and recovery, as well as establishing the White House Rural Opioid Federal Interagency Working Group and the Community Opioid Misuse Toolbox.
