During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, discussed a range of topics including the situation at the US-Mexico border, the conflict in Ukraine, and the Israel-Gaza conflict. He stated that the administration believes Russia has not used its influence to encourage separatists in Ukraine to abide by a ceasefire and that additional sanctions remain on the table. He also mentioned that the President has called for unfettered access for international investigators to the site of the downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 and that patience is running thin with Russian-backed separatists who are blocking access to the site. Earnest said that the President has directed Secretary of State John Kerry to travel to Egypt to work on a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. He also mentioned that the President plans to meet with Central American leaders to discuss the border crisis.
