President Donald Trump returned to Pennsylvania on January 18, 2018, to share the news that nearly 200 companies have issued bonuses, raised their minimum wage, planned investments, or donated to charity as a result of the recently passed Tax Cuts Act. The act, which lowers America's corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, aims to make U.S. businesses more competitive globally and provides relief for working families through cuts on the individual side. The child tax credit was doubled to $2,000 for families with children under 17 years old, and the Obamacare individual mandate was repealed. This marks the first overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years.
