The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has announced that the United States plans to invest up to $11 billion over three years to combat global malnutrition. This investment aims to equip partner countries with the skills and resources needed to improve health, diets, and nutrition. The funds will support critical emergency food and nutrition assistance, build resilient health systems, and create sustainable food systems. The investment is part of the U.S. government's commitment to ending malnutrition and improving diets and maternal and child health. The announcement was made by USAID Administrator Samantha Power at the 2021 Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit, which builds on the momentum for food security and nutrition from the United Nations Food Systems Summit. The investment is guided by the newly launched U.S. Government Global Nutrition Coordination Plan 2021-2026, which involves seven U.S. government agencies working together to scale up proven approaches to better nutrition. The plan focuses on policy action to advance nutrition security in the United States, expanding data availability and use, prevention and treatment of wasting, breastfeeding promotion and support, and improving diets in older children. The United States is also joining the School Meals Coalition, which aims to bring school nutrition coverage rates back to pre-pandemic levels and scale it up universally by 2030. The United States is currently the world's largest international school meals program through the USDA's McGovern-Dole Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program.
