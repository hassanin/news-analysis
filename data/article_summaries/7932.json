Jill and I send warm wishes to Buddhists in the United States and worldwide as they celebrate Vesak. This sacred day is a time to reflect on the teachings of the Buddha, which emphasize the importance of peace, justice, recognizing our shared humanity, respecting and protecting nature, and cultivating humility and compassion. For over 2,500 years, those who follow these teachings have made positive contributions to our world. On Vesak, we also honor American Buddhists for their contributions to our country and their promotion of common values.
