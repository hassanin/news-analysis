In the first 150 days of President Biden's administration, significant progress has been made in the fight against COVID-19. When Biden took office, the daily death toll was over 3,300, and there were over 185,000 new cases daily. The economy had also suffered significant job losses.

However, thanks to the President's COVID-19 strategy, the situation has improved. 300 million vaccine shots have been administered in 150 days, leading to a decrease of over 90% in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Additionally, the economy is experiencing a strong rebound.

The Biden administration's efforts have been focused on securing enough vaccine supply for all Americans, mobilizing Americans to get vaccinated, and increasing the number of vaccination sites. They have also prioritized equity, ensuring that communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19 have access to vaccines.

As a result of these efforts, more than 175 million Americans have received at least one vaccine dose, and COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are at their lowest levels since the start of the pandemic. The administration has also worked to increase vaccine confidence and accessibility through education and outreach efforts.

Overall, the progress made in the past 150 days has allowed America to start returning to normalcy, with a summer of joy and freedom on the horizon.
