The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has seen a surge in popularity, with more Americans signing up for health care coverage through its marketplaces than ever before. Over 19 million people have already enrolled, breaking previous records. Enrollment has grown by over 7 million since the current administration took office. The ACA has been successful in making health insurance premiums more affordable, with four out of five Americans finding coverage for $10 a month or less. However, there are concerns that extreme Republicans are trying to halt these efforts, pushing to repeal ACA improvements and potentially raising costs for millions of people, particularly older Americans and small business owners. The administration remains committed to expanding health coverage and reducing prescription drug costs, urging Americans to sign up for coverage before January 16th, 2024, through HealthCare.gov.
