The article discusses the new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan that was announced by President Barack Obama in 2009. The strategy aims to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its safe havens in both countries. It takes a regional approach, treating Afghanistan and Pakistan as two countries but one challenge, and focuses more intensively on Pakistan. The strategy includes increased U.S. and international support, both economic and military, linked to Pakistani performance against terror. It also emphasizes building capacity and providing more training for the Afghan National Security Forces. The strategy involves using all elements of national power, including civilian efforts and resources, to combat extremism. The President supports bipartisan bills to provide direct support to the Pakistani people and create Reconstruction Opportunity Zones in Afghanistan and the border regions of Pakistan. Additionally, the strategy aims to bring new international elements to the effort, including a new Contact Group for Afghanistan and Pakistan that includes all stakeholders in the region's security.
