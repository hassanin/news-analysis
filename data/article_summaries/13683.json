President Salih of Yemen called Assistant to the President John Brennan to apologize for his public remarks suggesting that Israel and the United States had engaged in destabilizing activities in Arab countries. President Salih expressed his commitment to political reform in Yemen and his efforts to engage with opposition groups through a democratic and peaceful process. Mr. Brennan appreciated the call and emphasized that blaming others for recent developments in the region is unhelpful and disregards the legitimate aspirations of Arab people. He encouraged President Salih to continue his constructive outreach and urged opposition groups to respond positively to the government's calls for dialogue. Mr. Brennan also reiterated President Obama's stance on nonviolent pursuit of interests by all sides.
