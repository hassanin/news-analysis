On November 6, 2017, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum stating that the national emergency declared with respect to Iran on November 14, 1979, will continue beyond November 14, 2017. The national emergency was initially declared to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The memorandum explains that the relations with Iran have not yet normalized and the process of implementing agreements with Iran is still ongoing. Therefore, the national emergency and measures adopted to deal with it must continue in effect. This renewal is distinct from previous emergency renewals and will last for one year. The memorandum will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
