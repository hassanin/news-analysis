The United States and Germany have a long history of security cooperation that began after World War II and grew stronger after German reunification. Germany is home to the largest permanent American force outside of the United States, with 51,000 troops. This presence allows for a strong transatlantic relationship and demonstrates the US commitment to European security. Germany hosts eight US military headquarters, including US European Command and US Army Europe. The country also houses the largest US Department of Defense medical facility outside of the US, which provides medical care to US service members wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq. Germany has been a part of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan since 2002 and is the third largest troop contributor. Germany also leads two Provincial Reconstruction Teams and operates the main logistic base supporting all forces in the region. The country is a significant contributor to international peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and deploys maritime forces to combat piracy off the coast of Africa. Germany and the US work closely together on nuclear non-proliferation initiatives and have cooperated to create a strong sanctions regime against Iran. In terms of counterterrorism and law enforcement, Germany and the US have a robust cooperative relationship, particularly in areas such as aviation security, cyber security, and countering violent extremism.
