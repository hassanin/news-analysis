A group of female former clerks of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh wrote a letter expressing their gratitude for his encouragement and support. Kavanaugh has hired more women than men as his law clerks, with 25 females and 23 males. In addition, 13 of his clerks are minorities, including five African-Americans, six Asian Americans, and two Hispanics. Kavanaugh has been known as a top "feeder judge," sending 39 of his 48 clerks to the Supreme Court. Despite being a conservative judge, Kavanaugh has also sent clerks to liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Stephen Breyer.
