The White House Office of the Vice President has released a new Public Service Announcement (PSA) as part of the 1 is 2 Many campaign, which aims to raise awareness about sexual assault. The PSA features film and television actors, including President Obama and Vice President Biden, and encourages men to speak up and intervene if they witness someone in danger of being sexually assaulted. It highlights the alarming statistics that 1 in 5 women are sexually assaulted while in college and that young women between the ages of 16 and 24 experience the highest rates of sexual violence from someone they know. The PSA will be shown in select movie theaters, on military installations, and ships worldwide, starting in May. Various actors participating in the PSA expressed their desire to raise awareness about sexual assault and promote prevention.
