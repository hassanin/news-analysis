In a press conference at Banks' Seafood Kitchen and Raw Bar in Wilmington, Delaware, President Biden discussed his recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the situation in Ukraine. The President stated that he made it clear to Putin that there would be severe sanctions if Russia makes any more moves into Ukraine. He also mentioned that the US will increase its presence in Europe with NATO Allies. The President expressed that he got the sense that Putin agreed to have three major conferences in Europe with senior staffs to discuss various issues. He emphasized the need for deescalation and not escalation of the situation in Ukraine. When asked if there will be more concrete progress after the talks in January, the President said that progress is expected when negotiating, but it remains to be seen. The President did not negotiate sanctions publicly but made it clear that Russia cannot move on Ukraine. The President and First Lady also expressed their condolences on the news of Betty White's death. When asked about New Year's resolutions, the First Lady stated that she hasn't made any yet, while the President jokingly said he will try to earn more love from her. The President mentioned that he may travel to Colorado and shared that he had a long talk with the Governor that morning, initiating additional help.
