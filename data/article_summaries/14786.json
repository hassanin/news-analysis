The President is expressing his support for a Senate proposal to fix the broken immigration system in the United States. He emphasizes the federal government's responsibility to enforce the law and secure borders. He also mentions that the failure to address the issue at the federal level has led to inconsistent and misguided actions at the state and local level. The President is pleased that the Senate proposal is consistent with a bipartisan framework presented by Senators Chuck Schumer and Lindsey Graham. He believes that the current immigration system doesn't work and it is unacceptable to have 11 million people living in the country illegally. The President outlines essential components that should be included in immigration legislation, such as stronger border security, tougher penalties for employers hiring illegal immigrants, clearer rules for future immigration, and a process for illegal immigrants to get right with the law, pay penalties and taxes, learn English, pass background checks, and eventually earn citizenship. The President emphasizes the need to iron out the details of a bill and welcomes a discussion on the topic. He commits his Administration to actively engage with partners on both sides of the aisle to work towards a bipartisan solution based on accountability.
