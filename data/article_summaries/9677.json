President Obama will be honoring the Stanley Cup Champion Chicago Blackhawks at the White House on March 11. First Lady Michelle Obama will also be present, along with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and USA Hockey Executive Director Dave Ogrean. After the ceremony, the First Lady, Commissioner Bettman, and Director Ogrean will oversee a street hockey workout and clinic on the South Lawn of the White House. The clinic is part of a collaboration between Mrs. Obama's Let's Move! initiative, the NHL, and USA Hockey to encourage American children to lead active and healthy lives. In addition to the event, members of the Blackhawks team and staff will visit troops and their families at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Media coverage of the President's remarks and the First Lady's event will be open, but limited space is available. Media members interested in covering the events must contact media_affairs@who.eop.gov by March 9. Those without a White House hard pass must also provide personal information for credentialing purposes.
