The United States has announced that it recognizes Niue as a sovereign and independent state and will establish diplomatic relations between the two nations. Niue plays a crucial role in the Pacific, supporting sustainable development, security, marine protection, and ocean conservation. This announcement will allow for deeper cooperation between the US and Niue on various challenges, including tackling the climate crisis, protecting maritime borders and resources, and promoting sustainable economic growth. The US plans to work closely with Niue, the Pacific Islands Forum, and the Pacific Community to strengthen Pacific regionalism and align objectives with the Pacific Islands Forum 2050 Strategy. The US is committed to being an active partner in the Pacific, as demonstrated by the launch of a national strategy for the Pacific Islands, the appointment of a US Envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum, and the hosting of the first US-Pacific Islands Summit. The recognition of Niue and the establishment of diplomatic relations will further strengthen bonds in the region and contribute to a shared future of greater security, prosperity, and dignity for all.
