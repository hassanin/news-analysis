Friday's jobs report showed a strong performance for the US economy, with 157,000 new jobs added in July, bringing the unemployment rate below 4%. Jobless claims remain at historically low levels, indicating rare layoffs. The manufacturing sector has also seen growth, adding 37,000 jobs in July, the highest number since December, and the strongest 12-month period for manufacturing job growth since 1995. Wages have increased, with US workers receiving their biggest pay increases in nearly a decade. Consumer confidence has also risen, with the rosiest view of current economic conditions since March 2001. The Federal Reserve described the economy as "strong" for the first time since 2006. The strong economic growth has been credited to President Trump's pro-growth agenda.
