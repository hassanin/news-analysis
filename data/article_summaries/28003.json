Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Wisconsin and ordered Federal assistance to help with recovery efforts in areas affected by severe storms, tornadoes, winds, flooding, and landslides from August 17 to September 14, 2018. Federal funding is available for affected individuals in eight counties, including grants for housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other recovery programs. State and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, can also receive federal funding for emergency work and facility repairs. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Steven W. Johnson has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free numbers will be available from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. seven days a week.
