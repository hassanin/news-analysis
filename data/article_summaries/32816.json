President Donald Trump has declared January 21-27, 2018 as National School Choice Week in the United States. The administration's vision for school choice is based on the principles of opportunity and results. They believe that communities should provide various educational options, such as traditional public schools, charter schools, private schools, magnet schools, parochial schools, virtual schools, and homeschooling. The goal is to empower parents and guardians to choose the best educational fit for their children. Charter schools, which didn't exist three decades ago, now have over 3 million students enrolled. School choice is particularly important for families who cannot afford to live in the school district of their choice, as it can be the difference between escaping poverty and falling behind. In 2017, over 16,000 schools participated in school choice events, and this year's National School Choice Week is expected to be even bigger. The Trump Administration believes that the education system should prepare students for future challenges and that a paper diploma is not enough for students.
