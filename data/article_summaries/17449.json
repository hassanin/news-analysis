The article discusses a memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on January 23, 2009, regarding the Mexico City Policy and Assistance for Voluntary Population Planning. The Mexico City Policy, introduced by President Reagan in 1984, restricted the use of US federal funds by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for abortions as a method of family planning. President Clinton rescinded the policy in 1993, and President George W. Bush reinstated it in 2001, extending it to include voluntary population planning assistance provided by the Department of State. However, President Obama revoked the policy in this memorandum, citing the broad conditions on grants and assistance awards as unwarranted and detrimental to efforts promoting safe and effective voluntary family planning programs in foreign countries. The memorandum directs the Secretary of State and the Administrator of USAID to waive any conditions in current grants and notify grantees of these waivers. It also instructs the Department of State and USAID to cease imposing these conditions in future grants. The memorandum concludes by stating that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States.
