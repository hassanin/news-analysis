President Biden convened a meeting with nine Democratic Governors to discuss the defense of reproductive rights. These Governors collectively represent a large number of women and are taking various actions to protect access to abortion care. Some of these actions include funding for reproductive health care services, public education, supporting the codification of the right to access abortion into state law and constitutions, issuing executive actions to defend patients and providers, and collaborating to support abortion access. The meeting focused on the impact of the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade, and the President reiterated his commitment to defending women's freedom to travel for lawful abortion care and access to FDA-approved medications for reproductive health care. The President also expressed his concern regarding the filibuster impeding the restoration of Roe into federal law and warned about Republican efforts to pass a nationwide ban on abortion. The President thanked the Governors for their work and expressed his Administration's desire for continued partnership to protect access to reproductive health care.
