Senior Biden-Harris Administration officials have met with manufacturers and partners of RSV immunizations, including Sanofi, AstraZeneca, and Thermo Fisher, to discuss the need to meet demand for immunizations this winter season. The administration has been urging manufacturers to expedite the availability of doses, and last month, an additional 77,000 doses were released for infants. The meeting also addressed efforts to increase availability of RSV immunizations for the 2024-25 viral season. The administration continues to prioritize access to vaccines and encourages Americans to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their loved ones.
