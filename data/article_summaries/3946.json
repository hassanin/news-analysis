Last week, a tragic mass shooting occurred in Nashville, resulting in the deaths of three students and three school officials. In response, 7,000 Tennesseans, including many students, marched to the state capitol to demand action from lawmakers. However, instead of addressing the issue, state Republican lawmakers voted to expel three Democratic legislators who supported the protesters. This expulsion is unprecedented and undemocratic, as it punishes elected representatives for engaging in peaceful protest. While the majority of Americans support common-sense gun safety reforms, Republican officials have been promoting bills that actually make schools, places of worship, and communities less safe. It is crucial for Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, enforce safe storage of firearms, eliminate gun manufacturers' immunity from liability, mandate background checks for all gun sales, and for state officials to follow suit.
