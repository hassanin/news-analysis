On World Humanitarian Day, National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice recognizes and honors the compassion and courage of humanitarians around the world. She remembers the 22 UN and relief agency staff who died in a bombing in Baghdad 13 years ago, as well as the thousands of aid workers who have been killed, wounded, or kidnapped in the past two decades. Rice emphasizes the importance of supporting and respecting humanitarians not only for their work, but also for what they symbolize - our capacity to help those in need, regardless of their background. She highlights the current global humanitarian crises, with a record 65 million people displaced within their own countries or living as refugees, and over 130 million people in need of humanitarian aid across 40 countries. Rice argues that these challenges cannot be solved by building barriers, but by fostering hope and compassion. She mentions President Obama's plan to convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees during the UN General Assembly, which aims to increase humanitarian funding, double the number of refugees benefiting from resettlement or other admissions programs, and empower refugees in countries of asylum. The goal is to strengthen the international humanitarian system to meet the unprecedented needs of today.
