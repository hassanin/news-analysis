The new commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Scott Gottlieb, wants to reduce drug prices significantly by enabling greater competition from generic drugs. Currently, drug spending in the U.S. accounts for about 17 percent of personal healthcare costs, with almost three-fourths of that spending going towards brand-name drugs. Generic drugs have been shown to substantially reduce prices when they enter the market. However, competition from generics often takes too long to arrive. Gottlieb aims to shorten the time it takes to approve generic drugs, potentially to as little as eight to 10 months. The FDA is also considering fast-tracking applications for generic copies of drugs that no longer have protected monopolies. Additionally, the FDA may allow the importation of generics approved by other well-regulated countries. Although the FDA's power to reduce drug prices is limited, Gottlieb's strategy has received wide support.
