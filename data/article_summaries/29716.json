The Office of the Special Representative for International Negotiations is working towards restarting discussions between Israelis and Palestinians in order to achieve a lasting peace in the region. One of their recent accomplishments is the agreement on the Red Sea-Dead Sea project, which will provide more drinking water in Gaza and the West Bank and construct a major water pipeline between Israel, the Palestinian Territories, and Jordan. Special Representative Jason Greenblatt has been praised for his genuine desire for peace and his diplomatic approach. Despite a busy schedule, he prioritizes his family and serves as an example of work-life balance. Despite a polarized political climate, both Republicans and Democrats are united in their hope for a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
