The White House has transmitted an Agreement on Social Security between the United States and the Slovak Republic to Congress. This agreement aims to coordinate social security systems between the two countries to prevent dual coverage and taxation for workers who divide their careers between the US and Slovakia. The agreement is similar to those already in force with other countries such as EU countries, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Norway, and South Korea. The agreement contains provisions required by the Social Security Act and additional provisions deemed appropriate by the President. The Social Security Administration has prepared a report explaining the key points of the agreement and providing a paragraph-by-paragraph explanation of the provisions. Another report has been included, as required by the Social Security Act, on the impact of the agreement on the US Social Security program's income, expenditures, and the number of individuals affected.
