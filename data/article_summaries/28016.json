President Donald J. Trump has signed into law H.R. 3298, the Wounded Officers Recovery Act of 2017. This bill allows the U.S. Capitol Police Memorial Fund to provide financial assistance to Capitol Police officers who are injured in the line of duty. This includes Special Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner, who were injured while defending Members of Congress and others during the shooting at the June 14, 2017 practice for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity. The President is proud to sign this bill and believes that Special Agents Bailey and Griner, along with all other law enforcement officers injured in the line of duty, deserve our unwavering support.
