The White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, issued a statement regarding the House Republican Budget Vote. The statement acknowledges the common goal of reducing the deficit and putting the country on a fiscally responsible path, but expresses disagreement with the Republican approach. The statement criticizes the House Republican plan for placing the burden of debt reduction on those who are least able to afford it, ending Medicare as it currently exists, and increasing healthcare costs for seniors in order to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. In contrast, the President has proposed a balanced approach to deficit reduction that emphasizes shared responsibility and shared prosperity. This approach involves cutting spending, reducing debt, supporting economic recovery, and making necessary investments for the future. The statement emphasizes the need for bipartisan cooperation in finding a solution to the nation's fiscal challenges.
