The White House has released a report highlighting the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The report states that the ACA has improved the healthcare system for millions of Americans and includes stories of individuals who have been helped by the law. Some of the key benefits mentioned in the report include: 

- 2.5 million more young adults have health insurance on their parent's plan.
- 5.1 million people with Medicare have saved an average of $635 on prescription drugs, and all Medicare recipients can receive free preventive services.
- Insurance companies are required to spend at least 80% of premiums on healthcare and cannot raise premiums by 10% or more without accountability.
- It is illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, and this protection will extend to all individuals in 2014.

The report also features examples of Americans who have benefited from the ACA, such as a recent graduate who can stay on her parent's plan until she is 26, small business owners who received a tax credit to offer health insurance to their employees, and a woman who was able to afford life-saving treatment due to the ACA. The report also discusses how the ACA is investing in public health and improving the quality of healthcare.
