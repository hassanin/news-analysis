President Donald Trump has transmitted legislation and supporting documents to the United States Congress to implement the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This agreement is a key part of the administration's efforts to rebalance trade in North America and modernize the trade relationship with Mexico and Canada. The USMCA aims to create new opportunities for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses by opening markets in Canada and Mexico and eliminating barriers to US goods, services, and investment. President Trump believes that approving this agreement is in the national interest and looks forward to Congress approving the legislation quickly.
