The International Atomic Energy Agency's Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) Bank has been launched in Astana, Kazakhstan. This initiative allows Member States of the IAEA to access a reserve of nuclear material for peaceful power reactors if they face difficulties in obtaining it on the international market. The LEU Bank was first conceived and funded by the Nuclear Threat Initiative and Kazakhstan has volunteered to host it, further establishing its reputation as a leader in promoting nonproliferation and nuclear security. In 2009, President Obama called for the development of an international fuel bank to ensure countries can access nuclear power without increasing proliferation risks. The American Assured Fuel Supply, created by down-blending surplus highly enriched uranium from the U.S. weapons program, along with similar programs by Russia and the UK, complement the IAEA's LEU Bank and provide a reliable supply of material for power reactor fuel in case of market disruptions. President Obama appreciates President Nazarbayev's leadership on nonproliferation for over two decades.
