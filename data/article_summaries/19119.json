In December 2011, the White House issued a statement by the President regarding the famine in the Horn of Africa. The region was experiencing the worst drought in 60 years, and over 13.3 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia were in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. The President expressed gratitude to the Americans who had donated and supported those in need in the Horn of Africa. He announced an additional $113 million in emergency relief assistance, bringing the total U.S. contribution to approximately $870 million. The funding would be used for food, health, shelter, water, and other urgent needs. The President also emphasized the importance of investing in the long-term food security of the region. The statement encouraged people to visit the FWD Campaign by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the website http://action.usaid.gov/ for more information on how to get involved.
