First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden are highlighting education for military families on a national tour. They hosted a science competition at Fountain-Fort Carson High School in Colorado Springs, where military children make up almost half of the student body. Joining them were Jamie Hyneman and Grant Imahara from the Discovery Channel program MythBusters. The event aims to raise awareness about the unique challenges military children face and the need for advanced placement courses and digital content services in math and science. The National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI), in partnership with the Military Child Education Coalition (MCEC) and Military Impacted Schools Association (MISA), is launching a campaign to bring rigorous STEM coursework to public high schools serving a high percentage of military families. This fall, NMSI will expand its Initiative for Military Families to an additional 28 public high schools in nine states, impacting over 40,000 students. Various organizations, including Boeing, Exxon Mobil, BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, and the Department of Defense Education Activity, are partnering to support this initiative. The Joining Forces initiative aims to ensure military families have the support they deserve.
