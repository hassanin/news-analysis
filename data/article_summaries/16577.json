Vice President Joe Biden and Governor Jon Corzine visited a construction site in New Jersey to highlight the progress of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The project involves upgrades to the Route 46 bridges and surrounding areas, which will create jobs and stimulate the economy. The bidding on the construction contract came in below estimates, allowing for additional construction projects. New Jersey has received $651 million in ARRA funds for highway projects and has committed $305 million to sixteen projects across the state. The Recovery Act has made nearly $27 billion available to states for repairs to roads and bridges.
