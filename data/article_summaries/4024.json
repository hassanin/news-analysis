The U.S. and Canada have co-hosted the first meeting of the U.S.-Canada Energy Transformation Taskforce, a result of President Biden's visit to Canada in March. The Taskforce aims to accelerate cooperation between the two countries on clean energy opportunities and supply chains, including renewable energy, electric vehicle supply chains, critical minerals, grid integration, and civil nuclear technologies. The meeting focused on refining strategic priorities and next steps for the year-long Taskforce, with a commitment to deploy clean energy solutions, electrify economies, and support the development of critical mineral and electric vehicle supply chains.
