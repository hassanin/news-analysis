On February 19, 2009, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13503, which established the White House Office of Urban Affairs. The purpose of this office is to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy for urban America. The order recognizes that about 80% of Americans live in urban areas, and the economic health and social vitality of these communities are crucial to the overall prosperity and quality of life in the country. The Office of Urban Affairs is tasked with coordinating the development of urban policy across executive departments and agencies, ensuring that federal programs consider the impact on urban areas, and effectively allocating federal funds to high-impact programs. The office is also responsible for engaging with state and local officials, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector to gather input and ensure the implementation of federal programs aligns with the goals of urban policy. The office works closely with various executive departments and agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, Department of Justice, Department of Commerce, Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, Department of Education, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Office of Urban Affairs is led by the Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Urban Affairs, who reports to the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Liaison, as well as the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. The executive departments and agencies are required to cooperate with the office and provide necessary support and assistance. The order states that it does not infringe on the authority of other departments or the functions of the Office of Management and Budget. It also clarifies that the order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other entity.
