The President has authorized targeted airstrikes in Iraq to support Iraqi Security Force operations in retaking the Mosul Dam. This mission is in line with President Obama's directive to protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq. The airstrikes are limited in nature, duration, and scope, and are being conducted in coordination with and at the request of the Iraqi government. The Administration will continue to consult with Congress and provide reports consistent with the War Powers Resolution.
