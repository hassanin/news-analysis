Jill and the author of the article send their best wishes to those celebrating Passover around the world. The Passover story is about overcoming adversity and finding hope, and it emphasizes the importance of recognizing the rights of others. It is a story of faith and a reminder that there is reason for hope even in times of oppression. This year, with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the message of Passover is especially relevant. The author hopes that next year, people will be able to celebrate in person and together.
