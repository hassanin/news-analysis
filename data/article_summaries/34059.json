The United States welcomes the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson and looks forward to his return home to be reunited with his family. They commend Pastor Brunson and his family for their strength during the two years of his detention. The US also expresses gratitude for the support of Members of Congress and the work of diplomats and consular staff in securing his release. However, the US remains concerned about the detention of other US citizens in Turkey and around the world and calls for their cases to be resolved in a transparent and fair manner. The US and Turkey have mutual concerns regarding regional security and stability and plan to work together on these issues.
