In a recent press conference, Jeff Zients, the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator, provided a progress report on the fight against the virus. He highlighted three fronts: vaccinations, testing, and ensuring an equitable response. The vaccination program for kids ages 5-11 is now fully up and running, with over 900,000 children in that age group estimated to have already received their first shot. The program includes trusted locations such as pediatricians' offices, pharmacies, children's hospitals, and community health centers. In addition, there has been progress in vaccinating unvaccinated individuals, with an average of 300,000 first shots given per day in the last seven days. Vaccination requirements have helped reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans ages 12 and older by almost 40 percent. Booster shots have also been successful, with over 25 million Americans receiving a booster dose. In terms of testing, the Department of Health and Human Services is investing $650 million to expand access to rapid diagnostic tests administered at healthcare settings. The goal is to increase overall testing capacity and make testing more accessible and affordable for consumers. Finally, efforts to ensure an equitable response have been effective in closing gaps in adult vaccination rates by race and ethnicity. The COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force has provided recommendations on how to continue mitigating health inequities caused by the pandemic and advance equity in the response. The administration has already taken action on 80 percent of the task force's prioritized recommendations and is investing $785 million in American Rescue Plan funding to support community-based organizations and initiatives focused on building vaccine confidence, protecting vulnerable populations, and improving access to quality healthcare.
