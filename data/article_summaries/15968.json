This article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney during a campaign trip to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Carney and Jen Psaki, both press secretaries, brief the press on matters of policy and campaign-related questions. They discuss President Obama's proposal to extend middle-class tax cuts and his opposition to extending tax cuts for the top 2 percent of American earners. They also mention the President's meeting with a middle-class family and the campaign's reports on the contrast between Obama and Romney's tax plans. They address questions about Romney's tax accounts overseas, the President's performance in Iowa, campaign financing, and the President's push for tax legislation. They also touch on foreign policy issues, such as the situation in Syria and Iran's role in the conflict. The press secretaries emphasize the President's efforts to fight against outsourcing and support companies that bring jobs back to the US.
