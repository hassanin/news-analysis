The White House National Monkeypox Response team has announced several actions taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to address the monkeypox outbreak and limit its spread. These actions include making vaccines, tests, and treatments more widely available, particularly to communities at high risk, such as the LGBTQI+ community. The administration has delivered almost 1 million doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine, the largest program of its kind in the world. The FDA has authorized the use of the vaccine for intradermal administration, allowing each vial to be used for up to five doses. This has led to some counties, including Los Angeles County and Fulton County, transitioning to intradermal administration. The CDC has provided resources to train healthcare professionals on administering the vaccine intradermally. The administration has also increased the availability of tests for the virus and made the TPOXX treatment more accessible to prescribe. To further protect communities at risk, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will make an additional 1.8 million vaccine doses available for ordering. HHS is also launching a pilot program to provide extra vaccine doses to jurisdictions hosting large LGBTQI+ events. Additionally, the HHS will make 50,000 courses of the TPOXX treatment available to jurisdictions for prepositioning. These actions aim to increase the availability of vaccines, tests, and treatments and protect communities most vulnerable to the virus.
