The Trump Administration has released a report titled "Emerging Technologies to Support an Aging Population," which highlights innovations that can improve the quality of life for older Americans. The report identifies six key areas where technology can enhance independence, safety, and well-being for older adults. These areas include artificial intelligence, autonomous transportation systems, the internet of things, and next-generation wireless networks. The report also emphasizes the need for intuitive, user-friendly designs and addressing privacy and security concerns. The widespread adoption of these technologies will require research and development efforts across various sectors. The Trump Administration aims to expand rural broadband to ensure that older Americans in all parts of the country can benefit from these technologies. The report serves as a guide for both the public and private sectors to support aging Americans in reaping the benefits of emerging technologies.
