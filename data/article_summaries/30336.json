During National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, Melania and President Trump express their support for those fighting colon and rectal cancer and remember those who have lost their lives to these diseases. The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2017, there were over 135,000 new diagnoses and 50,000 deaths from colorectal cancer in the United States. The administration is working with Congress to promote new approaches to cancer treatment, such as immunotherapy and precision medicine. They are also ensuring that new therapies, including gene therapies, can reach the market quickly while maintaining patient safety. Thanks to improved treatment and prevention measures, there are now over 1 million survivors of colorectal cancer in the United States. The President encourages all Americans to learn about their risk factors, prevention methods, and screening guidelines to reduce their risk of developing the disease. The administration supports all Americans battling colorectal cancer and appreciates the efforts of researchers, doctors, and other professionals in improving outcomes for cancer patients. With each medical breakthrough and survivor, they believe we are getting closer to a future free from the fear and threat of cancer.
