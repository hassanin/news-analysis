He emphasized the need for physical barriers and resources to address the crisis at the southern border. Pence called on Congress, particularly Democrats, to work with Republicans to close the loopholes in the border and end illegal immigration. He stressed that the situation is not just a crisis of illegal immigration, but also a crisis of national security. Pence and Governor Doug Ducey both urged Congress to act, emphasizing that this is not a partisan issue but a matter of public safety, border security, and national security. Pence clarified that the administration is not considering restarting family separations, but rather calling on Congress to close loopholes in the asylum system and amend court decisions that hinder the detention and processing of individuals. He also highlighted the need to be able to return apprehended individuals to their home countries. Pence stated that the system is broken and driving the crisis at the border, and it is crucial for Congress to recognize and address this issue.
