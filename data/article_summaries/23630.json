President Obama has granted commutations of sentence to 61 individuals. The individuals had been convicted of various drug offenses and were serving lengthy prison sentences. The commutations mean that their prison sentences will be shortened and they will be released earlier than originally scheduled. The commutations range from sentences expiring in July 2016 to sentences expiring in March 2017.
