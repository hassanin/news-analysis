The United States and 60 other countries have launched the Declaration for the Future of the Internet, which aims to address the challenges posed by rising digital authoritarianism and improve access to the internet. The declaration emphasizes the protection of human rights, the free flow of information, inclusive connectivity, privacy protection, and a multistakeholder approach to internet governance. The United States and its partners will work together to promote these principles globally while respecting each other's regulatory autonomy. The declaration aims to create a unified, unfragmented, and secure internet that supports freedom, innovation, education, and trust.
