President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Indiana and has ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding occurred between April 19 and May 2, 2011. The federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Donald L. Keldsen has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-3272.
