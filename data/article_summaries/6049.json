In this article, Vice President Kamala Harris responds to questions about new voting restrictions in Georgia and the possibility of abolishing the filibuster. She emphasizes the need for Congress to pass the For the People Act and restore the strength of the Voting Rights Act to prevent abusive practices that hinder people from exercising their constitutional right to vote. Regarding the filibuster, Harris acknowledges President Biden's stance on the issue and suggests that the Senate will ultimately make the decision. She expresses the importance of making progress and meeting the needs of the American people, particularly in areas like poverty. Harris also mentions the President's intention to be bold and focused on producing results rather than grand gestures, as seen with the American Rescue Plan and its impact on lifting children out of poverty.
