President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring December 3rd, 2016, as International Day of Persons with Disabilities. In the proclamation, Obama highlights the progress made in protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities in the United States, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Affordable Care Act. The proclamation also emphasizes the need to remove barriers and eliminate discrimination based on disability, both domestically and globally. The United States was the first country to comprehensively address non-discrimination on the basis of disability and declare that disability rights are human rights. Obama urges the Senate to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and calls on all Americans to observe the International Day of Persons with Disabilities with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
