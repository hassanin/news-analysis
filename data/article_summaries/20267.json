President Obama has declared a major disaster in Virginia and ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts after a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in December 2009. The federal funding will be available to the Commonwealth of Virginia, eligible local governments, and certain nonprofit organizations for emergency work, facility repairs, and replacement. The assistance will also cover emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation measures. Donald L. Keldsen has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-3272.
