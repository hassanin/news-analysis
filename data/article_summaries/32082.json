President Donald J. Trump has transmitted an Agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom regarding cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy to the Congress. The Agreement, negotiated in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, meets all applicable statutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and foreign policy interests of the United States. It provides a comprehensive framework for nuclear cooperation, allowing for the transfer of material, equipment, components, facilities, and information for nuclear research and power production. The Agreement has a term of 30 years but can be terminated by either party with one year's advance written notice. Key nonproliferation conditions and controls will continue in effect even after termination or expiration of the Agreement. The United Kingdom, as one of the five nuclear weapon states and a member of major export control regimes, plays an important leadership role in the global nonproliferation regime. The President has considered the views and recommendations of relevant departments and agencies and has determined that the Agreement's performance will promote the common defense and security. The President urges the Congress to give favorable consideration to the Agreement. Consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee will begin immediately, followed by a review period of 30 days in the Senate and 60 days in the Congress.
