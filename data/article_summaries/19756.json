The President has signed an Executive Order approving the implementation of portions of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRSHRA). This is part of the comprehensive sanctions effort aimed at pressuring Iran to meet its international obligations regarding its nuclear program. The ITRSHRA law, signed on August 10, 2012, expands on existing sanctions and imposes additional measures related to Iran's energy and financial sectors, weapons proliferation, terrorism support, and human rights abuses. The President has also delegated certain functions and authorities in the ITRSHRA to the Secretaries of State and Treasury and other cabinet-level officials. The United States will continue to work with Congress to implement the ITRSHRA in order to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The robust international sanctions, led by the United States, along with Iran's economic mismanagement and prioritization of its nuclear program over the needs of its people, have put unprecedented pressure on Iran's economy. If Iran continues to defy its international obligations, the United States and its partners will further tighten sanctions and impose increasing consequences.
