In this Presidential Memorandum issued on February 20, 2018, President Donald Trump addresses the need to review the regulations on bump fire stocks and similar devices following the mass shooting in Las Vegas in October 2017. The Obama Administration had previously deemed certain bump stock devices lawful, but President Trump sought further clarification on the law regarding fully automatic machine guns. The Department of Justice began the process of interpreting the definition of "machinegun" under federal law to determine if certain bump stock devices should be illegal. The public was given the opportunity to comment, and over 100,000 comments were received. President Trump now directs the Department of Justice to dedicate resources to review these comments and propose a rule banning all devices that convert legal weapons into machine guns. He emphasizes the importance of following legal procedures to ensure the resulting regulation is effective and does not create loopholes for criminals. The memorandum concludes by authorizing and directing the publication of this memorandum in the Federal Register.
