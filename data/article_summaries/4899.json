Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a press conference in the East Room, announcing that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act had passed in the United States Senate. She highlighted the importance of this bill, which will invest in roads, bridges, public transit, water systems, and high-speed internet access. The bill will also establish a national network of electric vehicle chargers and work towards a national fleet of electric school buses. Harris emphasized that this investment in infrastructure will create millions of union jobs and help businesses compete globally. She reassured that middle-class taxes will not be raised to pay for it. Harris thanked the senators and House members who worked together to pass the bill and praised President Joe Biden's leadership and commitment to delivering results for the American people. She concluded by stating that their work will continue even after the bill is signed into law. President Biden then took the podium to speak.
