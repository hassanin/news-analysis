President Obama signed the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act into law. This legislation protects a 35-mile stretch of Lake Michigan's coastline as a wilderness area and ensures public access for outdoor activities. It is the first public lands designation passed by Congress in five years and received bipartisan support. The President encourages Congress to consider other conservation proposals that would protect important lands and stimulate the economy. He will continue to protect federal lands for future generations.
