This executive order, issued on February 3, 2017, outlines the policy of the Trump Administration to regulate the United States financial system based on a set of principles called the Core Principles. These principles include empowering Americans to make independent financial decisions, preventing taxpayer-funded bailouts, fostering economic growth, enabling American companies to compete globally, advancing American interests in international financial regulation, making regulation efficient and effective, and restoring public accountability within federal financial regulatory agencies. The order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to consult with the heads of member agencies of the Financial Stability Oversight Council and report on the extent to which existing laws and policies promote the Core Principles and what actions have been taken to support them. The order also includes general provisions stating that it does not impair the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and it must be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
