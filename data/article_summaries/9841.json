The White House has announced that President Obama has extended the national emergency with respect to Sudan. This declaration, which was originally made in 1997, is based on the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan that continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The extension of this national emergency is necessary to address the ongoing crisis in Sudan.
