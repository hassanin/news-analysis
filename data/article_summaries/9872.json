The White House has announced new regulatory changes for Cuba sanctions, aimed at increasing opportunities for Americans and improving the lives of the Cuban people. The changes include making it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba, expanding access to U.S. financial institutions and the U.S. dollar from Cuba, and allowing Cubans living in the U.S. to earn a salary. These changes, along with the recent arrangement allowing up to 110 non-stop flights daily between the U.S. and Cuba, will significantly increase the ability of U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba and engage with the Cuban people. The goal of the President's policy with Cuba is to improve the lives of Cubans and advance U.S. interests by facilitating more interaction between the Cuban and American people. The White House believes that engagement and purposeful changes like these will empower the Cuban people, support human rights, improve their lives, and promote closer ties between the two nations.
