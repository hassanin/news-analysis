In this article, President Barack Obama issues a Presidential Memorandum to the Secretary of the Interior, directing the withdrawal of certain areas of the United States Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore Alaska from leasing disposition. The withdrawal is based on the principles of responsible public stewardship and takes into consideration the importance of these areas to Alaska Natives for subsistence use, as well as for marine mammals, wildlife, and wildlife habitat. The withdrawal is made under the authority granted in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and includes areas designated as leasing deferral areas within the Chukchi Sea Planning Area and the Beaufort Sea Planning Area, as well as the Hanna Shoal region of the Chukchi Sea Planning Area. The boundaries of the withdrawn areas are specified in attached maps and a table of OCS blocks. This withdrawal prevents these areas from being considered for future oil or gas leasing for exploration, development, or production, but it does not affect existing leases in the withdrawn areas.
