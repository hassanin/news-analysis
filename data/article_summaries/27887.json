Alabama, Hawaii, Maine, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington all saw rates that either matched or beat their previous lows. California, Colorado, Idaho, North Dakota, and Oregon also achieved new lows earlier in the year. The national unemployment rate currently stands at 4.1 percent, the lowest level since December 2000. Only two states, Alaska and South Dakota, along with the District of Columbia, have seen their unemployment rates increase in the past year.
