First Lady Jill Biden visited Burlington, Vermont as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's "Investing in America" tour. She thanked Governor Scott, Secretary Cardona, Senator Welch, Congresswoman Balint, Mayor Weinberger, and other leaders for their support. The administration has already announced over one billion dollars for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and green economy projects in Vermont. Jill Biden emphasized the importance of career-connected learning and the need for diverse learning paths that go beyond a high school diploma. She highlighted the creation of millions of new jobs in infrastructure, clean energy, and manufacturing that require associate degrees, certificates, or hands-on instruction. The Biden education pathway aims to provide free, high-quality universal preschool, access to affordable community college, and opportunities for students to pursue four-year degrees if desired. Jill Biden praised the state's investment in free community college and encouraged continued innovation in helping high schools and colleges work together to provide pathways to critical jobs. The Department of Labor also announced an $80 million grant competition to support training programs for jobs created by the administration's investment efforts. Jill Biden thanked Vermont for its leadership and expressed the administration's commitment to being partners in transforming opportunities for Americans to make a living and a life in the country.
