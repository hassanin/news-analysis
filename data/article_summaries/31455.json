On May 3, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to assist faith-based and community organizations in their efforts to strengthen civil society and American families and communities. The order emphasizes the important role that these organizations play in serving individuals, families, and communities, and aims to provide them with equal opportunities to compete for grants, contracts, and other federal funding. The order also amends previous executive orders related to faith-based and community initiatives, substituting the term "White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative" for "White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives" and making other changes to terminology. It establishes the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative, which will be headed by an Advisor and will work with various experts and leaders to implement the order and make recommendations to the President. The order also revokes previous executive orders related to faith-based and community initiatives. It concludes by stating that the order should be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, and that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
