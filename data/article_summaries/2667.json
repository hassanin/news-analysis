The Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to protect renters and homeowners who are still facing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC has extended the eviction moratorium until July 31, and the administration is providing support and guidance to state and local governments to prevent evictions. This includes urging courts to adopt eviction diversion practices and highlighting that funds from the American Rescue Plan can be used for eviction diversion plans, counseling, and legal services. The administration is also convening a White House Summit to develop community-specific solutions for eviction prevention. In addition, the administration is accelerating the delivery of emergency rental assistance and providing clarity on bulk payments, aiding those experiencing homelessness, and overcoming language and disability barriers. For homeowners, foreclosure moratoriums will be extended until July 31, and efforts will be made to prevent foreclosures and provide affordable loss mitigation options. The administration will also offer payment reduction options to help homeowners stay in their homes.
