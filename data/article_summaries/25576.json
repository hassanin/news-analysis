During a press briefing, Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin outlined President Trump's plan for tax reform. The plan includes significant tax cuts for both businesses and individuals, simplification of the tax code, and the elimination of certain deductions. The goal is to stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and provide relief for middle-income families. The plan also aims to make the US more competitive globally by lowering the corporate tax rate and implementing a territorial tax system. However, specific details and income brackets are still being worked out with Congress. The plan is expected to be revenue-neutral and pay for itself through economic growth and the reduction of deductions and loopholes. The President's tax returns were not addressed during the briefing.
