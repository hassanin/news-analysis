On May 22, 2003, President Barack Obama declared a national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq. This was done to address the threats posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of peace and security, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in the country. The obstacles to these efforts continue to pose a threat, so the national emergency declared in 2003 must continue in effect beyond May 22, 2014. As a result, President Obama has decided to continue the national emergency for another year. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
