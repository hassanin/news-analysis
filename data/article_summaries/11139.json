The White House has released a statement on the health care reform bill that was recently released by the Senate HELP Committee. The statement acknowledges the rising costs of health care and the burden it places on businesses, families, and governments. It highlights that the bill lowers costs, protects choice of doctors and plans, and ensures quality and affordable health care for Americans. The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed the bill and concluded that it will cost less and cover more Americans than originally estimated. The statement also mentions that the bill includes provisions to protect the coverage Americans receive at work. When combined with the Senate Finance Committee's companion pieces, the Senate will be prepared to vote for health reform legislation that does not add to the deficit, reduces health care costs, and covers 97% of Americans. The bill reflects many of the principles laid out by the President, such as prohibiting insurance companies from refusing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and the concept of insurance exchanges where individuals can find affordable coverage. The statement also mentions the inclusion of a public health insurance option, which would increase competition and provide more choices for consumers. The legislation also aims to improve the quality of patient care, patient safety, and preventive health care. The statement concludes by thanking Chairman Kennedy, Senator Dodd, and all the members of the HELP Committee for their hard work on health reform.
