Vice President Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Poroshenko about the Ukrainian government's efforts to resolve the crisis in the eastern part of the country. Biden offered condolences for the loss of Ukrainian service members and commended Poroshenko's commitment to his peace plan and efforts to unify the country. Biden emphasized that G-7 leaders have called for Russia to stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border and to influence separatists to renounce violence, both of which Russia has failed to do. Biden mentioned that the United States will impose further costs on Russia if it continues on its current course. The two leaders pledged to stay in touch leading up to the European Union leaders meeting on June 27.
