In this Presidential Memorandum issued by President Donald J. Trump on October 5, 2018, he determines that the development and purchase of equipment and materials needed for Lithium Sea-Water batteries are essential to national defense. The President states that without his action, the United States industry would not be able to adequately and timely produce these batteries. He further asserts that purchases, purchase commitments, or other action under the Defense Production Act of 1950 are the most cost-effective and practical way to meet this critical need. The memorandum concludes by authorizing and directing the publication of this memo in the Federal Register.
