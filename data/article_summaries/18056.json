Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko about the implementation of the Minsk agreements, economic reforms, and anti-corruption initiatives. They discussed Ukraine's local elections and the need for Russia and separatists to grant full access to the Donbas region. Biden also reiterated the US's willingness to provide a $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine, contingent on progress in investigating and prosecuting corruption and ensuring tax reform is consistent with the IMF program.
