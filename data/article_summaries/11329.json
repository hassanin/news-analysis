President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Maine and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts from Tropical Storm Irene. The funding will be available for emergency work, repairs, and replacements of damaged facilities in Franklin, Oxford, and York Counties. Hazard mitigation measures will also be funded on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Albert Lewis has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
