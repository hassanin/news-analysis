President Trump plans to sign an executive order directing federal agencies to allocate resources to "opportunity zones" across the country. These zones, designated by governors and approved by the Treasury Department, are areas with high poverty rates or adjacent to high-poverty areas. The aim is to attract investment by offering tax breaks to fund start-ups, housing developments, and other economic activities. The executive order will create a White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, led by Ben Carson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to prioritize these zones in federal efforts such as grant funding, loan guarantees, infrastructure spending, and crime prevention. The administration aims to encourage investors to focus on areas most in need of economic revitalization and believes this initiative will energize philanthropists and investment professionals concerned about economic inequality. The council will need to decide whether to prioritize the hardest-hit zones or to include all zones in federal aid.
