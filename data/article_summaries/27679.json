President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation recognizing Minority Enterprise Development Week, which celebrates the contributions of minority-owned businesses to the US economy. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of creating a business climate that allows minority business enterprises to thrive and expand. It also highlights the administration's plans for tax cuts and tax reform, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a cap on the top tax rate for family-owned and small- to mid-sized businesses. The proclamation calls for the elimination of unnecessary regulations, fair and reciprocal trade relationships, lower taxes, and increased capital flow to strengthen the US economy. The week is meant to empower hardworking Americans to contribute to the country and communities.
