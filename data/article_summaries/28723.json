The Presidential Memorandum issued by President Donald Trump on April 19, 2018, outlines the United States Conventional Arms Transfer Policy. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of strategic conventional arms transfers in achieving national, economic, and foreign policy objectives. It aims to maintain a technological edge over potential adversaries, strengthen partnerships with allies and partners, bolster the economy, enhance the defense industrial base, and protect against destabilizing arms trade. The memorandum also highlights the need to consider national security, economic security, relationships with allies and partners, human rights, international humanitarian law, and nonproliferation when making arms transfer decisions. The Secretary of State, in coordination with other relevant departments, is tasked with developing an action plan to implement the policy and align the export policy for unmanned aerial systems with national and economic security interests. This memorandum supersedes a previous Presidential Policy Directive and is subject to applicable law and appropriations.
