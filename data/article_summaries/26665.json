In this op-ed, Peter Navarro, Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, discusses the idea that economic security is national security. He argues that in today's complex times, it is not only military strength that is important, but also economic strength. Navarro believes that nations engaging in fair trade is crucial, as currently, the US engages in free trade with other nations without receiving fair reciprocation. He suggests that President Donald J. Trump's focus on economic security as national security is a new organizing principle for strategic policy.
