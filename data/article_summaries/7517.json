The US government is working to secure the release of Brittney Griner, who is being wrongfully detained in Russia. The President has directed the administration to urge her captors to improve her treatment and the conditions she is facing in a penal colony. Despite a lack of good faith negotiation by the Russians, the US government has continued to follow up on its offer to resolve the wrongful detentions of American citizens. The government is committed to advocating for the release of Brittney and other Americans detained in Russia, including Paul Whelan.
