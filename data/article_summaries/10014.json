This article is a message from President Barack Obama to the Congress of the United States regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans. According to Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice stating that it is to continue beyond the anniversary date of its declaration. In this case, the President has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the Western Balkans emergency is to continue beyond June 26, 2010. The crisis in the region, caused by extremist violence and acts obstructing the implementation of various agreements, has not been resolved. These actions are considered a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the President has determined it necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain sanctions to respond to this threat.
