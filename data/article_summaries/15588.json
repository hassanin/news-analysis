President Obama is commending Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio for their efforts in achieving a significant victory in early childhood education in New York. The state has committed to investing $1.5 billion over 5 years to gradually introduce publicly-funded preschool throughout the state, benefiting thousands of children, including 53,000 in New York City. The President is urging Congress to support his plan to collaborate with states and cities in offering high-quality preschool to all children, and is encouraging other states and cities to take similar action to ensure children are prepared for kindergarten.
