President Obama traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he toured Celgard, LLC, a lithium battery separator producer and stimulus grant recipient. He delivered remarks on the economy and took questions from an audience of approximately 300 Celgard employees. The President was joined by Rep. John Spratt, Jr. and greeted on arrival by Governor Bev Perdue, First Gentlemen Bob Eaves, Lt. Governor Walter Dalton, Mayor of Charlotte Anthony Foxx, U.S. Representative Mel Watt, State Senator Charlie Dannelly, State Representative Kelly Alexander Jr., Bryan Moorehead (Celgard Vice President of Operations), and Bob Toth (Polypore CEO). Celgard has won $49.2 million in Recovery Act grants to expand its capacity to produce separators for lithium-ion batteries. The expansion is expected to create between 200-300 North Carolina jobs within Celgard and provide more than 1,000 jobs among Celgard's contractors and suppliers.
