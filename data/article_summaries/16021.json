The article discusses the disappointment of the White House with the Senate Republicans' decision to deny emergency unemployment insurance for 1.7 million Americans. The White House believes that this insurance is crucial for supporting families as they actively search for jobs. The President has emphasized the need to give these hardworking individuals a chance and not allow one vote to hinder their support. In the past, both parties have worked together to prevent such hardships, and neglecting to do so now is deemed unacceptable, especially given the high long-term unemployment rate. The President has taken action by bringing together CEOs who have agreed to help the long-term unemployed find jobs, and he has announced new steps to expand partnerships for this purpose. The White House urges Republicans in Congress to allow this bill to be voted on and remove this unnecessary burden on the economy and American families.
