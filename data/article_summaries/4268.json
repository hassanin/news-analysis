One year ago, on International Women's Day, President Biden established the White House Gender Policy Council with the goal of advancing gender equity and equality. In the past year, the Biden-Harris Administration has made progress in expanding economic opportunities for women, preventing and responding to gender-based violence, improving access to healthcare, promoting gender equality globally, and supporting diverse leadership and full participation. They have also taken steps to advance equality for transgender Americans. Moving forward, the Administration remains committed to various initiatives, including helping women reenter the workforce, closing wage gaps, lowering costs for families, expanding access to healthcare, and addressing gender-based violence. They will continue to collaborate with partners both domestically and internationally to achieve their vision of a world where all genders have equity, equality, and dignity.
