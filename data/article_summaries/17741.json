President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New Jersey and authorized federal aid to assist in recovery efforts following a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred from January 22-24, 2016. The federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Atlantic, Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Somerset, Union, and Warren are eligible for this assistance. Additionally, funding for snow assistance is available for a continuous 48-hour period in several counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Seamus K. Leary has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
