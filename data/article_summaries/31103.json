On May 7, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation declaring it Be Best Day. The purpose of Be Best Day is to promote the well-being of children and educate them about critical issues they may face in today's world. The proclamation highlights two specific challenges: negative social media behavior and the opioid crisis. It emphasizes the importance of using technology in positive ways and raising awareness about the risks of neonatal abstinence syndrome. The proclamation encourages Americans to understand the issues children face, educate themselves about the harmful effects of drug misuse, and get involved in programs that help educate youth.
