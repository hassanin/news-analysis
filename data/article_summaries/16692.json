In this letter, President Barack Obama informs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate that he is continuing the national emergency with respect to Cuba. This emergency was initially declared due to the Cuban government's destruction of two unarmed U.S. registered civilian aircraft in international airspace in 1996. The President states that the emergency will continue beyond March 1, 2012, and he has sent the notice to the Federal Register for publication.
