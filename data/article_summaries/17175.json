This article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney during President Obama's trip to Orlando, Florida. The President is visiting Disney World and will be announcing an executive order and other initiatives to increase travel and tourism in the United States. The travel and tourism industry is a significant part of the US GDP and employment, and the President believes that increasing international tourism will create more jobs. The President has signed an executive order to develop a national strategy to make the US the top travel and tourism destination. He has also tasked departments to increase non-immigrant visa processing capacity in China and Brazil. The article also briefly mentions the Keystone pipeline and Iran's threatening comments towards US allies in the Middle East. The press gaggle ends with some light-hearted questions about the President's preference for Disney World or Disneyland and favorite rides.
