President Obama has announced the Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders, which is the new flagship program of the President's Young African Leaders Initiative. The program will bring over 500 young African leaders to the United States each year for leadership training and mentoring. It aims to invest in a new generation of young African leaders, respond to their demand for practical skills, deepen partnerships between the US and Africa, and build a network of young African leaders. The Fellows will receive training in public management, administration, business, entrepreneurship, and civic leadership. They will spend six weeks at American universities and colleges, and will also have the opportunity to intern at US agencies and companies. The program will also provide opportunities for Fellows to put their skills into practice in Africa, including internships and job opportunities in the private and public sectors. Washington Fellows will have access to funding opportunities to support their ideas and businesses. The program aims to sustain a strong alumni network by organizing regular events and networking opportunities. Participants will be required to mentor other young leaders and grow the network.
