In a press briefing, Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Bharat Ramamurti discussed the changes made to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to ensure more equitable distribution of relief funds to small businesses. These changes included a 14-day exclusivity period for businesses with fewer than 20 employees to apply for relief. Ramamurti highlighted the early results of these changes, which showed an increase in loans to smaller firms, minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, and first-time PPP borrowers. He also mentioned that there is still plenty of money available for small businesses and encouraged them to apply for relief. Additionally, Ramamurti mentioned that the American Rescue Plan includes over $50 billion in additional aid for small businesses. The press secretary, Jen Psaki, also addressed questions about the border crisis, vaccine passports, debt, and other topics.
