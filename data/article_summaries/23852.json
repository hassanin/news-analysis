Vice President Biden announced the creation of a new Manufacturing Innovation Institute in Rochester, New York, focused on integrated photonics manufacturing. This institute is the sixth of nine public-private partnerships aimed at boosting advanced manufacturing and fostering American innovation. The Department of Defense is awarding the institute to a consortium led by the Research Foundation for the State University of New York (RF SUNY), with a total investment of over $610 million. The institute will focus on developing lower-cost, higher-speed, and more efficient manufacturing processes for photonic circuits, with the goal of revolutionizing industries such as telecommunications, medical technology, and defense operations. The creation of this institute is part of a broader effort to strengthen American manufacturing and secure U.S. leadership in emerging technologies. Vice President Biden also called on Congress to make critical bipartisan investments in manufacturing to strengthen the economy and create jobs.
