The Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy Council, Jennifer Klein, and the Assistant to the President, Senior Advisor to the President, and Director of the Office of Public Engagement, Stephen Benjamin, hosted a discussion on pay equity with Deputy Director of the Office of Personnel Management, Rob Shriver, private sector employers, and equal pay experts. Executives from companies such as Microsoft, Mastercard, and Salesforce discussed the policies they have implemented to promote pay equity. Experts emphasized the importance of working with the private sector and companies of all sizes to advance fair pay practices. They highlighted that policies promoting pay equity benefit both workers and businesses by promoting workforce inclusivity, worker retention, and a culture of transparency and trust, which in turn lowers costs related to recruitment, hiring, and training. As part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to serve as a model employer, the Office of Personnel Management announced a proposed rule to advance pay equity for Federal workers. The rule would prohibit the use of a job applicant's prior salary history when making hiring decisions and setting pay for Federal employees. Participants agreed that leaders in both the private and public sectors have a role to play in ending discriminatory pay practices and committed to partnering together to adopt policies that benefit workers and businesses. The Administration officials thanked the participants for their leadership and reaffirmed the White House's commitment to pay equity.
