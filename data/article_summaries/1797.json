Private Travis King is in US custody, according to a US official. The US government has successfully facilitated King's departure from North Korea after a months-long effort involving multiple US government agencies. The US government has been reaching out to North Korea through various channels to ensure King's well-being and secure his safe return home. Private King appears to be in good health and good spirits. The Swedish government played a vital role as the protecting power for the United States in North Korea, and China assisted in facilitating King's safe transit. The focus now is on King's health and ensuring he receives appropriate support before reuniting with his family. The US government remains open to the possibility of further diplomacy with North Korea. There were no concessions given to North Korea in exchange for King's release. The exact details of the operation are not disclosed for operational security reasons. The President has been following the issue closely, but it's unclear if he has spoken with King or his family. The role of the Swedish government was to facilitate King's release, while China helped with the transfer. The Swedish government provided important communication and coordination throughout the process. The operation involved intense diplomacy and coordination among various departments and agencies. The focus now is on King's well-being and reintegration, and administrative actions will be addressed later.
