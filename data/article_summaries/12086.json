The White House Rural Forum, held at Penn State University, focused on issues facing rural communities, such as economic growth, healthcare, and housing. The White House Rural Council, established in 2011, coordinates efforts to improve rural America by streamlining federal programs and engaging stakeholders. The forum announced various investments and programs to support rural America, including $3 billion in private sector funding for rural infrastructure projects, grants for broadband deployment, funding for rural businesses, grants to increase rural veterans' access to healthcare, and investments in volunteer service to address the opioid crisis. Other initiatives include the Rural IMPACT Demonstration pilot program, economic development planning assistance for rural communities, health information technology investments, investments to address chronic diseases, community coaches to tackle child poverty, investments in rural teacher preparation programs, and the release of a memorandum titled "Rural Strategies that Work" which presents successful policies and administrative actions for rural communities. The accomplishments of the White House Rural Council were also highlighted.
