President Obama announced his intent to nominate Richard Cordray as the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB was created last year as an independent agency with the primary mission of acting as a watchdog for American consumers. Cordray is currently the Chief of Enforcement at the CFPB and has a strong background in advocating for middle-class families. The CFPB has already made progress in areas such as simplifying credit card forms, improving mortgage disclosures, protecting servicemembers, and ensuring compliance with consumer protection laws. As of July 21, 2011, the CFPB will consolidate the authority of seven other agencies and become the dedicated cop on the beat protecting American consumers. Cordray has a diverse background, having served as Ohio's Attorney General, State Treasurer, and Treasurer of Franklin County. He is a graduate of Michigan State University, Oxford University, and the University of Chicago Law School.
