In Presidential Determination No. 2023-04, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declares that it is important to the national interest to provide assistance under the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act. The assistance will not exceed $50 million from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund. This aid is intended to address unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs resulting from the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria in February 2023. The assistance will be directed towards international and non-governmental organizations to provide humanitarian aid to refugees, internally displaced persons, and their host communities. The Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration of the Department of State will also receive funds for administrative expenses. The determination will be submitted to Congress, accompanied by a Justification, and published in the Federal Register.
