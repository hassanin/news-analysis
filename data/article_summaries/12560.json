This article is a Presidential Proclamation issued by Barack Obama on March 14, 2016. The proclamation is related to the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which designates certain sub-Saharan African countries as beneficiaries for trade purposes. In the proclamation, Obama revokes a previous proclamation that suspended duty-free treatment for agricultural goods from South Africa under AGOA. The revocation is based on the determination that South Africa has taken actions to comply with the requirements of AGOA. The proclamation also states that any previous proclamations or executive orders inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded.
