This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on March 6, 2019, revokes Section 3 of Executive Order 13732. This section required the Director of National Intelligence, or another designated official, to release an unclassified summary of the number of strikes undertaken by the United States Government against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities, as well as assessments of combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from those strikes. It also mentions the reporting requirements on civilian casualties caused by United States military operations. The order states that the civilian casualty report should be submitted in unclassified form but may include a classified annex. It also mentions that the report shall be made available to the public unless the Secretary of Defense certifies that its publication would pose a threat to national security interests. The order concludes with general provisions, stating that it does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, and that it should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It clarifies that the order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
