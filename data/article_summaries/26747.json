On January 9, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to support the health and well-being of veterans and uniformed service members. The policy aims to improve mental healthcare and access to suicide prevention resources during the critical one-year period following the transition from uniformed service to civilian life. The order directs the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Homeland Security to collaborate on addressing the challenges faced by transitioning veterans. Within 60 days, they are required to submit a Joint Action Plan to provide seamless access to mental health treatment and suicide prevention resources. Within 180 days, a status report on the implementation of the plan and proposed reforms must be submitted. The order emphasizes the need for high-quality mental healthcare for veterans and the prevention of suicides during the transition period. The implementation of the order should be consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
