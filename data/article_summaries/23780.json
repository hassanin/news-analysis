In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims June 2014 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Pride Month. He celebrates the progress that has been made in achieving equality and justice for the LGBT community, including the Supreme Court's decision to strike down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act. The administration has extended benefits to legally married same-sex couples and has taken actions to prevent discrimination and violence against LGBT Americans. However, the President acknowledges that there is still work to be done, such as passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act to protect LGBT workers from being fired based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. The President also emphasizes the need to address health disparities within the LGBT community and calls on other nations to defend the universal human rights of LGBT individuals. The proclamation honors the brave leaders and allies who have fought for equality and encourages everyone to promote tolerance, justice, and dignity.
