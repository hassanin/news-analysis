In this press briefing, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs confirms that President Obama will not sign H.R. 3808, a bill related to notarizations for financial documents. The President is concerned about unintended consequences on consumer protections, especially in light of the home foreclosure issue and developments with mortgage processors. The President will exercise a pocket veto, sending the legislation back to Congress to iron out these unintended consequences. Gibbs also discusses the upcoming midterm elections, the Mideast peace process, the December AfPak report, the oil spill response, health care waivers, the economy, China's currency, and education. He also addresses concerns about the scientific integrity guidelines, the Ghailani trial, and the President's campaign schedule.
