On June 25, 2013, the President signed H.R. 475 into law. This law expands the list of vaccines covered under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. It adds all seasonal influenza vaccines to the list of vaccines that require a Federal excise tax of 75 cents per dose.
