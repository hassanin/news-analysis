The White House has announced a new $8 billion Community College to Career Fund, which aims to train two million workers for high-demand industries. The fund will support partnerships between community colleges and businesses to provide training programs in areas such as healthcare, transportation, and advanced manufacturing. It will also provide funding for paid internships and apprenticeships, as well as support for regional or national industry sectors to develop skills consortia. The fund will also implement "pay for performance" strategies to provide incentives for training providers and community colleges to ensure trainees find permanent jobs. Additionally, the fund will encourage businesses to invest in America by partnering with state and local governments. It will also support pathways to entrepreneurship for small business owners. The Obama Administration has already made significant investments in community college-led job training through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training initiative. They have also developed partnerships between businesses and community colleges through the Skills for America's Future initiative.
