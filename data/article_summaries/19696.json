President Obama has signed a major disaster declaration for the state of Michigan, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts after flooding occurred between April 16 and May 14, 2013. The declaration allows for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures in several affected counties. Mark A. Neveau has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
