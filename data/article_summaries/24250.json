President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Tennessee due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between June 5-10, 2014. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. This funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Anderson, Bledsoe, Carroll, Decatur, Henry, Hickman, Houston, Lawrence, Lewis, Madison, Marion, Maury, McNairy, Moore, Perry, Roane, Sequatchie, and Tipton are eligible for this assistance. Additionally, federal funding will be available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. W. Michael Moore has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and further designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and based on damage assessments.
