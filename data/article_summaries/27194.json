President Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to investigate China's laws, policies, practices, and actions related to intellectual property, innovation, and technology. The memorandum aims to determine whether China's actions are unreasonable, discriminatory, and harmful to American interests. China's laws and practices have been accused of encouraging the transfer of American technology and intellectual property to Chinese enterprises, restricting U.S. exports, and undermining American manufacturing, services, and innovation. The memorandum also highlights the theft of American intellectual property and defense-related technologies, which is estimated to cost the U.S. economy up to $600 billion per year. President Trump is committed to protecting America's intellectual property and technology.
