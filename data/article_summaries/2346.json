On Human Rights Day and during Human Rights Week, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reaffirms the importance of the idea that every person is created equal and endowed with inherent dignity and inalienable rights. He emphasizes that this idea was fundamental to America's founding and the enshrinement of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights following World War II and the Holocaust. The United States stands with those who fight for their basic human rights in the face of oppression and injustice, and the country has rejoined the United Nations Human Rights Council to assert its moral leadership on the global stage. The Biden Administration is amplifying the voices of marginalized communities and supporting pro-democracy activists and defenders. The President also mentions equipping the people of Ukraine to fight for their freedom against Russia's aggression. He hosted the first-ever Summit for Democracy and launched the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal, further strengthening the commitment to protect human rights and democracy. President Biden highlights the importance of leading by example, mentioning various actions taken by his Administration to promote human rights domestically, such as ending the Muslim ban, overturning the prohibition on transgender people serving openly in the military, advancing racial equity, addressing inequities in the criminal justice system, and establishing a White House Gender Policy Council. He also signed a major bipartisan gun safety law. President Biden calls upon the people of the United States to observe Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
