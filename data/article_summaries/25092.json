President Ronald Reagan declared the first National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month in 1983, and 11 years later, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease himself. Today, Alzheimer's disease continues to affect Americans, with an estimated 5.3 million Americans age 65 and older currently living with the disease. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The article emphasizes the need for greater awareness, support, and research to alleviate suffering and find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. The US government is committed to supporting research efforts through initiatives like the National Institutes of Health's Brain Research and the 21st Century Cures Act. Public-private efforts are also being made to speed up diagnosis and find new treatments for dementia. While progress is being made, there is still a long way to go in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.
