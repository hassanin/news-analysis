Governor Abbott's inspections of trucks at Texas-Mexico ports of entry are causing disruptions to the food and automobile supply chains. This is leading to delays in manufacturing, job losses, and increased prices for families in Texas and across the country. Local businesses and trade associations are urging the Governor to reverse this decision as trucks are experiencing long delays of over 5 hours at some border crossings and commercial traffic has decreased by up to 60 percent. These actions are hindering the smooth flow of legitimate trade and travel, and are negatively impacting the jobs and livelihoods of hardworking American families.
