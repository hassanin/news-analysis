Karen Pence, the Second Lady, visited Tracy's Kids at Methodist Children's Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. She painted with the children, and they shared with her the importance of art therapy. One 10-year-old boy even gave her one of his paintings of the Statue of Liberty. Pence also received a note from a patient who does art therapy for 95% of the day, and they recorded a video message for her. Another patient who has been in and out of the hospital for six months said art therapy is the only thing that gets her out of her room. Pence expressed her gratitude to the art therapist and the community in San Antonio for supporting the art therapy program. She is passionate about promoting art therapy and will continue to share stories about her visits across the United States and around the world.
