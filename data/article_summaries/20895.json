The article is a fact sheet and list of participants at a Rose Garden announcement by the Obama Administration on May 19, 2009. The announcement was about the national fuel efficiency policy, which aimed to regulate fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions. The program covered model years 2012 to 2016 and required an average fuel economy standard of 35.5 mpg in 2016. The policy was supported by ten car companies and the UAW and aimed to reduce oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. It was seen as beneficial for consumers, the economy, and the country by saving consumers money, preserving consumer choice, reducing pollution, providing clear rules, lowering compliance costs for automakers, promoting energy independence, and bringing people together. The on-stage participants included CEOs of car companies, UAW President Ron Gettlefinger, Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Jackson. The expected attendees included government officials, senators, governors, and representatives from environmental organizations.
