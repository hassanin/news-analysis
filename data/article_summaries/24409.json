President Barack Obama has proclaimed March 7 to March 13, 2010, as National Consumer Protection Week (NCPW). NCPW aims to educate American consumers about being careful consumers at every stage of life, from grade school to retirement. The focus is on teaching children about advertising, marketing, smart financial practices, and protecting personal information. The President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability is working to help individuals make informed financial decisions. The President supports the creation of an independent Consumer Financial Protection Agency to protect consumers from predatory practices. Federal, State, and local consumer protection agencies, as well as private sector organizations and consumer advocacy groups, have a responsibility to provide resources for consumers. Americans are encouraged to visit Consumer.gov/NCPW for informative and interactive resources to understand their consumer rights.
