Twenty-five years ago, Matthew Shepard was tragically murdered in a brutal act of hate and violence. His death shocked the nation and the world. In response to this horrific crime, Matthew's parents, Judy and Dennis Shepard, turned his memory into a movement to combat anti-LGBTQI+ hate and violence. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act was enacted to extend federal hate crimes laws to cover sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability. As Vice President, the speaker had the honor of participating in this legislation. However, despite progress, threats and violence targeting the LGBTQI+ community continue to rise. The speaker calls on Congress to pass the Equality Act to ensure full civil rights protections for LGBTQI+ Americans. The goal is to fight against hate, violence, and bigotry in all its forms, so that every American is treated with dignity, acceptance, and respect. The speaker sends their condolences and blessings to Judy, Dennis, and all those grieving and remembering Matthew Shepard.
