On May 12, 2022, the President signed a law called S. 270, also known as the "Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park Expansion and Redesignation Act." This law redesignates the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in Kansas as the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park. It also allows for the inclusion of additional related sites in the National Park System. The President expressed gratitude to Senators Coons, Carper, Graham, Warner, Tim Scott, Moran, Kaine, and Marshall, as well as Representatives Clyburn, Blunt Rochester, Norton, and Good for their leadership in making this law possible.
