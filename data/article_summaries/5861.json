Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act states that a national emergency will automatically terminate unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and transmits it to Congress within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the emergency declaration, stating that the emergency is to continue. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register, stating that the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations, which was declared in Executive Order 13581 on July 24, 2011, and further addressed in Executive Order 13863 on March 15, 2019, is to continue beyond July 24, 2021. The justification for this decision is that these criminal organizations pose a threat to the stability of international political and economic systems, as they are becoming more sophisticated and entrenched in foreign governments and the international financial system. They weaken democratic institutions, degrade the rule of law, undermine economic markets, and facilitate violent conflicts and the activities of other dangerous individuals. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
