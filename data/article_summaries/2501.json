The Biden-Harris Administration has made significant progress in jumpstarting the offshore wind industry in the United States. Two years ago, President Biden set a goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind electricity generation by 2030. Since then, the administration has taken transformative actions to achieve this goal and create good-paying jobs in sectors like manufacturing, shipbuilding, and construction.

At the International Offshore Wind Partnering Forum in Baltimore, White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi outlined ten ways the administration is making progress towards the 2030 goal and aiming for 110 gigawatts by 2050. These include announcements on offshore wind cost reduction pathways and innovation strategies. In the past year, American offshore wind investments have tripled, with an additional $10 billion invested across the nation.

The offshore wind industry not only expands economic opportunities for American workers and communities but also strengthens energy security, improves the reliability of the power grid, reduces costs, and decreases climate pollution. The administration is committed to advancing offshore wind development responsibly, in collaboration with states, tribes, coastal communities, and various stakeholders. Data-driven decisions are being made to protect marine ecosystems and promote ocean co-use.

To support offshore wind, the administration is taking actions across multiple federal agencies, including the Departments of the Interior, Energy, Commerce, and Transportation. These actions aim to develop stronger supply chains, upgrade infrastructure, and foster a growing clean energy economy.
