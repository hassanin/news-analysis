President Barack Obama will award Sergeant First Class Leroy Arthur Petry the Medal of Honor for his courageous actions during combat operations in Afghanistan in May 2008. This makes Petry the second living, active duty service member to receive the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan. Petry, currently assigned to the 75th Ranger Regiment, has completed multiple combat tours to Afghanistan and Iraq. He will be honored for his selfless service and bravery. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty.
