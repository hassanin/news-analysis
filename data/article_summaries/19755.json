Vice President Joe Biden has announced the signing of three Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) between the United States and Australia to advance cancer research and care. The MOUs will facilitate scientific collaborations in the field of clinical proteogenomic studies and their translation to cancer care. The agreements will create a framework for collaboration and data-sharing between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the United States and various research institutes in Australia. The state governments of New South Wales and Victoria have also signed separate MOUs with the NCI to promote and conduct research on cancer prevention, treatment, and management. The goal is to create an unprecedented international dataset that will be publicly available for use by cancer researchers and physicians around the world. Additionally, the government of New South Wales will invest $6 million dollars (AU) and the Victorian Cancer Agency will establish a new U.S./Victorian Cancer Fellowship program to support senior researchers conducting cancer research. The collaboration will focus on advancing proteogenomic research, training and exchanging scientists with expertise in proteogenomic data, and disseminating and sharing information.
