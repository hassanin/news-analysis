In May 2009, President Obama announced several steps to support sustainable energy options, specifically in the area of biofuels research and commercialization. He established a Biofuels Interagency Working Group, which would develop a comprehensive biofuel market development program, coordinate infrastructure policies, and identify new policy options for promoting the environmental sustainability of biofuels. The President also allocated $786.5 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to accelerate advanced biofuels research and development and expand commercialization. Additionally, he announced the Environmental Protection Agency's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Renewable Fuel Standard, which aimed to increase the supply of renewable fuels to reduce dependence on foreign oil and greenhouse gas emissions.
