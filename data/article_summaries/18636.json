In this letter, President Barack Obama declares a national emergency with respect to Venezuela under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The declaration is made due to the threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by the situation in Venezuela. The order does not target the people of Venezuela but aims to address issues such as erosion of human rights guarantees, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, violence and human rights violations in response to protests, arbitrary arrest and detention of protestors, and public corruption. The order blocks the property and interests of individuals involved in these actions and grants certain authorities to the Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of State to enforce the order. It also suspends entry into the United States for individuals meeting certain criteria. All executive agencies are directed to take appropriate measures to carry out the provisions of the order.
