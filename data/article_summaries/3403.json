The Biden-Harris Administration is urging states, localities, and tribes to effectively utilize the resources provided by the American Rescue Plan to address home energy costs this winter. They are calling on utility companies that receive public funding to prevent utility shut-offs and assist in the distribution of federal aid. Seven major utility companies, including DTE Energy, Eversource, and National Grid, have already committed to using their resources to help. The Administration is also encouraging states, localities, and tribes to prepare early for the distribution of expanded LIHEAP (Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program), use emergency rental assistance to help renters with utility costs, and utilize all available tools to support working and middle-class families. Additionally, the Administration highlighted additional financial support available to help families struggling with energy costs.
