This article is a presidential memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on October 15, 2010. The memorandum is titled "U.S. Drug Interdiction Assistance to Brazil" and is addressed to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. 

In the memorandum, President Obama certifies that the interdiction of aircraft suspected of engaging in illicit drug trafficking in Brazil's airspace is necessary due to the significant threat posed by drug trafficking to Brazil's national security. He also states that Brazil has appropriate procedures in place to prevent innocent loss of life during these interdictions, including measures to identify and warn an aircraft before the use of force is employed. 

The memorandum authorizes and directs the Secretary of State to publish this determination in the Federal Register and notify Congress of this decision.
