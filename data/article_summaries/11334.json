President Obama has declared an emergency in the State of Washington due to flooding and mudslides. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts. The Department of Homeland Security, through FEMA, will coordinate disaster relief efforts to alleviate hardship and suffering, save lives, and protect property and public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources as needed. Emergency protective measures will be provided at 75 percent federal funding. Michael J. Hall has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
