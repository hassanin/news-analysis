President Trump announced the launch of the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, a U.S. government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. The goal of the initiative is to reach 50 million women by 2025 through three pillars: helping women prosper in the workforce, assisting women entrepreneurs in accessing finance and capital, and creating enabling environments for women to thrive. The initiative will coordinate efforts across the federal government, work with other nations and organizations, and prioritize the allocation of funds to empower women. The President signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum to establish the initiative and directed the USAID to allocate an initial $50 million for a new W-GDP fund.
