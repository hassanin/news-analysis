President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor will continue beyond July 22, 2012. Despite Liberia's progress in promoting democracy and the conviction of Charles Taylor for war crimes, the actions and policies of Taylor and others still pose a threat to Liberia's efforts to strengthen its democracy and develop its institutions and resources. These actions and policies also pose a threat to the foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
