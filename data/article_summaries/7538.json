In a press conference, President Biden provides an update on his efforts to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza and evacuate Americans from the region. He reveals that he had a phone call with President Sisi of Egypt, who has agreed to open the Rafah Crossing to allow up to 20 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The trucks will be coordinated by Ambassador Satterfield and the United Nations will be responsible for distributing the aid once it crosses the border. However, if Hamas confiscates the aid, the United States will stop sending humanitarian aid to them. President Biden emphasizes the importance of providing relief to the people of Gaza and maintaining credibility worldwide. He also mentions his discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and his hope to evacuate more Americans from Gaza. President Biden expresses his sympathy for the survivors and first responders he met during his visit to the region and explains the significance of offering support and hope to those affected by tragedy. He addresses the controversy surrounding the destruction of the Gaza hospital and asserts that the U.S. Defense Department finds it highly unlikely that Israel was responsible. The press conference concludes with questions about the possibility of U.S. military involvement if Hezbollah initiates a war against Israel and the repairs needed on the roads for the aid trucks to pass through.
