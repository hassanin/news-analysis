The President has signed into law H.R. 2289, which changes a subsection of the Internal Revenue Code to allow married individuals filing a joint return to claim the maximum deduction for each spouse's qualified contribution to an individual retirement plan. This subsection will now be known as the "Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA" in honor of the former U.S. Senator from Texas.
