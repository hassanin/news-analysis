On October 12, 2017, President Donald Trump issued executive orders related to healthcare. The orders aim to increase competition and choice in the healthcare system, and provide more affordable options for Americans. The orders prioritize three areas for improvement: association health plans (AHPs), short-term, limited-duration insurance (STLDI), and health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs). AHPs would allow small businesses to group together to purchase insurance, giving them access to better terms and more affordable options. STLDI, which is exempt from certain regulations, would provide an alternative to government-run exchanges for individuals without coverage through their workplaces. HRAs would give employees more flexibility and choices regarding their healthcare financing. The orders also focus on promoting competition, limiting consolidation, and improving access to healthcare information. The Secretaries of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services are directed to propose regulations or revise guidance within specified timeframes to expand access to AHPs, increase availability of STLDI, and enhance the usability of HRAs. Public comments on the proposed regulations will be considered, and reports on the extent of non-conforming laws and actions that could be taken to align with the order's policies will be provided every two years. The order does not impair existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits.
