This article is a press gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest aboard Air Force One. Earnest is joined by Alan Krueger, the President's chief economist, who discusses the President's infrastructure proposals. Krueger explains that the US is underinvested in infrastructure and that investing more would make the country more competitive and bring more jobs back home. The President's three proposals include a national infrastructure bank, America Fast Forward Bonds, and expanding the TIFIA and TIGER grant program. These proposals are budget-neutral and would leverage $21 billion in capital. The article also briefly mentions the situation in North Korea, the Italian government, and a new rule on gasoline by the EPA. It concludes with a mention of the President's upcoming schedule, including the White House Easter Egg Roll and meetings with the Prime Minister of Singapore.
