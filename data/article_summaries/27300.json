The article discusses a series of executive orders issued by President Trump regarding online platforms and free speech. The President argues that a limited number of online platforms should not have the power to censor or control the speech that Americans can access on the internet. He believes that such censorship is un-American and anti-democratic. The executive orders aim to clarify the scope of immunity provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from liability for content posted by others. The orders also call for a review of federal spending on advertising and marketing on online platforms, as well as an assessment of viewpoint-based speech restrictions imposed by these platforms. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is instructed to consider taking action against unfair or deceptive acts or practices by online platforms. Additionally, a working group will be established to explore potential enforcement of state statutes that prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices by online platforms. The Attorney General will also develop a proposal for federal legislation to promote the objectives of the executive orders.
