President Barack Obama has declared September 19th to September 25th, 2010, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. In his proclamation, he acknowledges the hard work and dedication of farmers, ranchers, and farmworkers, recognizing their contributions to the nation's food production and economy. The president emphasizes the importance of ensuring the safety and health of those in the agriculture sector, as farming remains a labor-intensive and sometimes dangerous occupation. He encourages regular training on safety procedures and the proper handling of hazardous materials, as well as proactive health and safety instruction for farms and ranches with children or novice farmers. President Obama calls upon agencies, organizations, businesses, and extension services to strengthen their commitment to promoting farm safety and health programs. He also urges Americans to show appreciation for the contributions of farmers, ranchers, and farmworkers to the nation's agricultural heritage.
