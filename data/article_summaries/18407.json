The White House Press Secretary expressed disappointment in a statement regarding the Senate Republicans' blocking of the Cybersecurity Act of 2012. The Act was seen as a vital national security bill that aimed to address vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure systems. The statement also criticized the House information sharing bill, which was considered flawed and threatening to personal privacy without providing adequate protection for the nation's critical infrastructure. The Administration had previously sent a legislative package to Congress in May 2011, which included tools needed for securing the nation while safeguarding privacy rights and civil liberties. The Administration had also provided extensive briefings and testimonies on cybersecurity legislation. Despite the President's calls and pleas from national security officials, the politics of obstructionism and special interest groups prevented the passage of legislation to better protect the nation from cyber-attacks.
