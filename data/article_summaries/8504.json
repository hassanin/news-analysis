Seventy-seven years ago, the United Nations General Assembly was established with the goal of creating a world where all people can live with dignity. On United Nations Day, the commitment to sustaining and strengthening these institutions is renewed. As the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is commemorated, the call to advance freedom, justice, and peace is emphasized. The world is currently facing significant challenges such as conflicts, climate change, and humanitarian crises, and the decisions made now will shape the future. The United States recognizes its duty to lead in this critical moment and will work with international partners to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to eradicate poverty, ensure access to quality healthcare, protect the environment, and promote peace. The United Nations plays a crucial role in realizing this vision, and the United States is committed to making global institutions more responsive, effective, and inclusive. Efforts are being made to address workers' rights, workplace discrimination, climate change, and other challenges. By recognizing common hopes and supporting the United Nations, humanity can bend the arc of history towards peace, conflict prevention, and alleviating human suffering. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. proclaims October 24, 2023, as United Nations Day and encourages appropriate ceremonies and activities to observe this day.
