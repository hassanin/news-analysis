Yesterday, the U.S. Government, along with the Council of Economic Advisers and the Treasury, convened a workshop to address the integration of climate risks into macroeconomic models. The workshop aimed to identify best practices for incorporating climate risks into economic forecasts, share data gaps and modeling limitations, and raise awareness of climate-related macroeconomic risk assessment and management. The physical consequences of climate change pose a significant risk to the global economy, and the transformation of energy systems needed to address climate change will require fundamental shifts in investment strategies. The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes this challenge and has instructed relevant government agencies to develop methods for accounting for climate risks in economic assumptions and long-term projections. The White House has also taken steps to collaborate with external organizations and countries to develop new methodologies. The workshop represents a collaborative effort to advance knowledge and speed up the transition towards a net-zero global economy.
