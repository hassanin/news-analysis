President Biden is convening a meeting with private sector companies that have committed to ending surprise fees by fully disclosing fees to consumers upfront. These companies service millions of consumers each year and aim to provide a better shopping experience without surprise fees at check-out. Junk fees, hidden fees that companies add onto customer bills, are a widespread issue in various industries. Research has shown that these fees make it harder to compare prices, hinder competition, and result in consumers paying more. Companies such as Live Nation, SeatGeek, xBk, Airbnb, and others are making commitments to offer all-in pricing or improve transparency in the coming months. These actions are in response to President Biden's call to address hidden fees. The administration has also taken administrative actions to tackle junk fees in every sector of the economy. The voluntary actions by companies demonstrate their recognition of the importance of providing consumers with upfront, transparent pricing. However, more legislative action is needed to address junk fees comprehensively. President Biden continues to call on Congress to pass legislation that mandates upfront all-in pricing, bans surprise fees, eliminates early termination fees, and bans family seating fees.
