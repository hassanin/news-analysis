The Vice President is scheduled to engage in various activities in Los Angeles related to addressing the root causes of migration from Central America. These activities include delivering remarks at a women's economic empowerment event, hosting roundtables with women leaders and business executives, and announcing new initiatives and funding to support women's economic empowerment and reduce gender-based violence in the region. The Vice President's approach is centered around providing hope and economic opportunities to individuals in Central America, with a focus on addressing issues such as poverty, corruption, and gender-based violence. The administration has been successful in generating over $3.2 billion in investments from 40 different companies and organizations for the region, which will create tens of thousands of jobs. The Vice President believes that addressing the root causes of migration requires a comprehensive approach that includes better governance, anti-corruption efforts, rule of law, reducing violence, and empowering women. Additionally, the Vice President will launch an initiative called the Central American Service Corps, which will provide young people in northern Central America with paid community service opportunities to address local priorities and develop life and job skills. The administration is committed to engaging with the governments of the Northern Triangle countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras) and civil society, while also upholding principles such as anti-corruption and good governance. The participation of Northern Triangle leaders in the summit may vary, but their countries will be represented, and the Vice President maintains relationships with these leaders. The Vice President will also engage with other countries, including Spain and Canada, on migration issues.
