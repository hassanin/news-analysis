On April 23, 2009, President Obama declared a major disaster in the state of Georgia due to severe storms, flooding, tornadoes, and straight-line winds that occurred since March 26, 2009. This declaration allows for federal funding to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Affected individuals in certain counties can receive grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other assistance programs. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures. Terry L. Quarles has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional counties may be designated for assistance. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling FEMA.
