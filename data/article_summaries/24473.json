President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Iowa and has ordered federal aid to assist in recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between June 14-23, 2014. The declaration makes federal funding available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The funding will be provided on a cost-sharing basis. Additionally, federal funding will also be available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Michael L. Parker has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and further designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments.
