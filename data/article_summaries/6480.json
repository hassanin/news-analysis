President Biden's Investing in America Agenda is allocating $8.2 billion for 10 major passenger rail projects in the United States. This funding is part of the larger $66 billion investment in passenger rail from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago. The selected projects include building a new high-speed rail system between California and Nevada, creating a high-speed rail line through California's Central Valley to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, upgrading frequently-traveled rail corridors in Virginia, North Carolina, and the District of Columbia, and expanding capacity at Chicago Union Station in Illinois. These projects will create tens of thousands of good-paying, union jobs, improve economic opportunity, and provide safe and climate-friendly travel options. The investment also includes $34.5 million to guide passenger rail development on 69 rail corridors across 44 states. President Biden has announced a total of $30 billion for rail projects, including investments in the Northeast Corridor and rail safety projects. The administration aims to create a pipeline of intercity passenger rail projects for future investment through the Corridor ID Program. Overall, these investments will reduce greenhouse emissions, create jobs, and improve rail infrastructure in the United States.
