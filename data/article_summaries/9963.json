The article announces that the United States has lifted most of its sanctions on the Government of Libya after consulting with the new Libyan government. The sanctions were initially imposed in response to attacks by the Qadhafi regime against the Libyan people. The international financial sanctions prevented Qadhafi from using Libya's assets for violence and preserved the country's wealth for its rightful owners. With the defeat of the Qadhafi regime and Libya's transition to democracy, the United States has now unfrozen all government and Central Bank funds within its jurisdiction, except for those belonging to the Qadhafi family and former regime members. These measures, along with the actions taken by the United Nations Security Council, will allow the Libyan government to access most of its worldwide holdings and support the country's transition and reconstruction. The United States is also assisting Libya in making these assets available from financial institutions. The article emphasizes the US's support for the Libyan people in ending the Qadhafi regime and looks forward to a continued partnership with the new government.
