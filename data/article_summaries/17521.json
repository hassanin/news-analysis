President Obama announced a reciprocal visa validity arrangement with China that will extend the validity of short-term tourist and business visas from one to ten years, and student and exchange visas from one to five years. This arrangement aims to improve trade, investment, and business ties between the two countries by facilitating travel and offering easier access to both economies. The United States hopes to welcome a growing share of eligible Chinese travelers, inject billions into the U.S. economy, and create hundreds of thousands of additional jobs. Chinese travelers consistently rank the United States as their most-desired travel destination, but ease of visa policies is cited as the second most important factor in deciding where to travel. By extending visa validity, the United States aims to secure its place as the chosen destination for millions of Chinese travelers. The growth of outbound travel from China represents a significant opportunity to foster job creation in the United States. China is the fastest-growing outbound tourism market in the world, and in 2013, 1.8 million Chinese travelers visited the United States, contributing $21.1 billion to the U.S. economy and supporting over 109,000 American jobs. The number of Chinese citizens able to afford international travel is projected to more than double in the coming years, and close to 7.3 million Chinese are projected to travel to the United States by 2021, contributing nearly $85 billion a year to the economy and supporting 440,000 jobs. By extending visa validity, the United States aims to maintain a competitive advantage in the global business arena and attract more Chinese travelers. Additionally, the arrangement will enhance student visas, allowing American and Chinese students to more easily travel back and forth, increasing opportunities for people-to-people ties and boosting mutual understanding.
