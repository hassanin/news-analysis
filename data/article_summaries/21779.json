The White House is hosting its first-ever South by South Lawn (SXSL) event on October 3rd. SXSL is inspired by South by Southwest and aims to bring together creators, innovators, and organizers for a day of music, film, and ideas. The festival will be live-streamed on WhiteHouse.gov, Facebook, and sxsw.com/live. The event will also be open to pre-credentialed media, although space is limited. Participants can join the conversation using #SXSL to share their ideas and how they plan to make a difference in the world. For more information, visit obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/SXSL.
