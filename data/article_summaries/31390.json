President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump hosted the Ford's Theatre pre-Gala reception at the White House, continuing a tradition that began in 1978 with President Jimmy Carter and First Lady Rosalynn Carter. The reception is considered the cornerstone of the Ford's Theatre Annual Gala weekend. Guests included past Lincoln Medal recipients, members of Congress, and other distinguished guests. After the reception, the President and First Lady attended a variety show at Ford's Theatre, featuring performances by Kevin McAllister, Johnnyswim, Nova Y. Payton, Angaleena Presley, David Selby, and Ricky Skaggs. This year's Lincoln Medal recipients were Ronald Perelman and Peyton Manning. Ford's Theatre, which reopened in 1968 after being closed for over 100 years following the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, is a partnership between Ford's Theatre Society and the National Park Service, and serves as a destination to explore and celebrate Lincoln's ideals and leadership principles.
