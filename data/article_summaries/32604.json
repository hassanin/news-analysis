On March 27, 2019, President Trump awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor to Staff Sergeant Travis Atkins, a fallen hero who sacrificed his life for the nation. The ceremony took place in the East Room of the White House and was attended by members of Congress, military leaders, and the Atkins family. Travis Atkins grew up in Montana and joined the Army at the age of 24. He served in Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division and later re-enlisted with the 10th Mountain Division. On June 1, 2007, in a town outside of Baghdad, Atkins and his squad encountered suspected terrorists. As Atkins searched one of the insurgents, he realized the man was wearing a suicide vest. Atkins engaged the insurgent in hand-to-hand combat and managed to throw him to the ground, sacrificing his own life to shield his fellow soldiers from the explosion. Atkins' son, Trevor, accepted the Medal of Honor on behalf of his father. The ceremony also honored the three soldiers who were saved by Atkins' heroic actions.
