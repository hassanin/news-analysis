President Obama has signed an Executive Order to improve educational outcomes for African Americans. The White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans will work with federal agencies and partners to ensure that African American students receive a complete and competitive education. The initiative aims to address obstacles such as lack of access to effective teachers, safe schools, and college-preparatory classes. Improving educational outcomes for African Americans will benefit the country by increasing college completion rates, employment rates, and the number of African American teachers. The initiative will focus on increasing kindergarten readiness, providing access to rigorous coursework and support services, promoting equitable access to effective teachers, reducing disciplinary disparities, decreasing the dropout rate, increasing college access and attainment, and improving adult education and career readiness. The initiative will also establish a Presidential Advisory Commission and a Federal Interagency Working Group to enhance educational outcomes for African American students.
