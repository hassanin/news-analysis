On September 12, 2018, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared a national emergency due to the threat of foreign interference in United States elections. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. While there has been no evidence of a foreign power altering election outcomes or vote tabulation in the US, foreign powers have historically tried to exploit the country's political system. The proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has increased the vulnerability to foreign interference. The ability of individuals outside the US to undermine public confidence in elections through unauthorized access to election infrastructure or the dissemination of propaganda remains a significant threat to national security and foreign policy. As a result, the national emergency declared on September 12, 2018, will continue beyond September 12, 2022. This extension is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
