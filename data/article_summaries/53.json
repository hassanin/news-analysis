President Biden and Prime Minister Modi co-hosted a group of G20 leaders at the 2023 G20 Summit in New Delhi, India. The leaders discussed the acceleration of investments in high-quality infrastructure projects and the development of economic corridors through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI). The aim is to narrow the infrastructure gap in low- and middle-income countries, promote economic activity, and enable inclusive and sustainable growth. The United States will leverage public capital to mobilize private sector investments and collaborate with partners to meet the needs of the countries involved. The PGI will build coalitions of partners, including governments, the private sector, and multilateral development banks, to develop key economic corridors and drive high-quality investments. President Biden announced new projects, including the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, a partnership with the European Union to expand the Lobito Corridor, and PGI projects in various sectors and regions. The article also highlights specific initiatives, such as the modernization of ports in El Salvador, investment in graphite mining in Mozambique, the development of a vessel traffic management system in the Philippines, and efforts to bridge the gender digital divide through the Women in the Digital Economy Initiative.
