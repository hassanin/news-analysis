FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell provided an operational update on the recovery efforts in Florida after Hurricane Ian. She mentioned that there are still over 1,600 federal responders on the ground, supporting various operations such as feeding, sheltering, power and communications restoration, and public health and safety. The search and rescue mission has ended, and the focus is now on power restoration, with less than 1% of the state currently without power. Criswell also mentioned the registration of thousands of families for federal assistance and the approval of Critical Needs Assistance and Clean and Sanitize Assistance. When asked about the disagreement with Governor DeSantis regarding the President's visit, Criswell stated that the location was mutually agreed upon and that there were no concerns expressed by Florida emergency officials. She also reassured that the disagreement would not impact the ongoing recovery efforts.
