Karen Pence, the Second Lady, recently visited art therapy programs in New York City. She spent time with Dr. Irene Rosner David, who started an art therapy program for 9/11 attack victims. The artwork shared by Irene showed a transition from images of destruction to images of hope and new beginnings. Terry Miles, the Executive Director of the World Trade Center Environmental Health Center, also joined the visit. The World Trade Center Health Program helps those affected by the aftermath of 9/11. The art therapy program provides a sense of hope and resolution for the victims turned survivors. Karen Pence also visited the Behavioral Health Chemical Dependency Art Therapy Program at Bellevue Hospital. Here, she observed a group art therapy session for patients dealing with addictions. Lena Friedman and Emily Bradley, two art therapists at Bellevue, led the session. The clients shared how art therapy has helped them discover their true selves and gain confidence to overcome their addictions. Bellevue Hospital offers art therapy to all mental health patients, combining it with medical treatment, counseling, and social work. The program has been successful in helping patients find their identities and overcome challenges.
