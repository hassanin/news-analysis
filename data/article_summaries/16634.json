The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet on the progress made in using behavioral science insights to better serve the American people. The fact sheet highlights the work of the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team (SBST), which was created in 2014 to translate research insights into improvements in federal policies and programs. Over the past year, SBST has collaborated with various agencies on more than 40 projects, focusing on areas such as healthcare, economic opportunity, climate change, criminal justice reform, job assistance, and family health coverage. Some of the notable results include increased workplace savings plan enrollment rates, improved access to credit for small family farms, increased enrollment in retirement savings accounts, and enhanced decision-making tools for health insurance plans. The fact sheet also mentions the release of new guidance to agencies to support the continued implementation of behavioral science insights. Overall, the fact sheet emphasizes the positive impact that behavioral science can have on delivering more efficient and effective government services.
