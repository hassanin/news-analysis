The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to engage communities with high numbers of uninsured individuals. The goal is to help these individuals gain health coverage through outreach efforts. At the end of the enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of signups in each community to the estimated number of eligible uninsured individuals to determine the most successful community. The winning community will receive a visit from President Obama. In North Carolina, the health insurance coverage through the Marketplace is affordable, with the majority of people able to find a plan for $100 or less. Tax credits are available, with the average savings being $315 per month. Consumers have multiple options for health plans, with an average of 24 plans per county in North Carolina. Switching to the lowest-cost plan can result in significant savings on premium costs. While progress has been made in reducing the uninsured rate, there is still work to be done. In Charlotte and the surrounding region, there are 153,000 uninsured individuals eligible for the Marketplace.
