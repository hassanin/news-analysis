President Obama has declared a major disaster in Kentucky due to severe storms, flooding, mudslides, and tornadoes that occurred from May 1, 2010, onwards. Federal aid will be provided to supplement recovery efforts in the affected areas. This includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to assist individuals and business owners in recovering from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is coordinating recovery operations, and additional counties may be eligible for assistance once damage assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
