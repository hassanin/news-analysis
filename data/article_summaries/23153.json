Senator Wendell Ford, who recently passed away, was a highly effective legislative leader according to Vice President Joe Biden. Ford believed in working together with colleagues instead of making speeches, and always prioritized Kentucky while representing all of America. He played a crucial role in bringing transparency to government, improving airline safety, and ensuring greater access to voting. As the Whip, Ford's leadership led to the passing of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, which had a profound impact on the lives of women and men globally. On a personal note, Ford had a long-standing connection with Biden's family, as he provided Sara Jones Biden her first job on Capitol Hill, which led to her meeting Biden's brother. Last year, Jill Biden had the honor of speaking in Ford's hometown, Owensboro, Kentucky, and it was evident that his legacy will endure in the community and across the United States. Biden considered Ford not only a respected senator but also a close personal friend, seeking his advice long after Ford's retirement from the Senate. The Vice President expressed his condolences to Ford's family during this challenging time, emphasizing that Ford was a good man who will be missed.
