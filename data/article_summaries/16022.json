President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Ohio due to severe storms and flooding caused by the remnants of Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Warren J. Riley has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
