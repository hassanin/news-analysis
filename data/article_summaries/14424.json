In this statement, President Barack Obama strongly condemns the violence against unarmed civilians in Cote d'Ivoire. He expresses particular shock at the killing of unarmed civilians, especially women, who were marching in support of the legitimately elected President Alassane Ouattara. The President emphasizes the need for all armed parties to protect civilians and calls for the identification and accountability of those responsible for atrocities. He reaffirms that Alassane Ouattara was elected as the President of Cote d'Ivoire, and Laurent Gbagbo's refusal to step down is an assault on the rights and democracy of the Ivorian people. President Obama urges Gbagbo to respect the will of the people and peacefully transfer power to President Ouattara.
