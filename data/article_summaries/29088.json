Dr. Benjamin Carson, the HUD Secretary, believes that there is no housing issue more important than when a person or a family is completely without housing. It is especially tragic when this person is a veteran who once served the nation. Homelessness is a problem that can be solved, and last week, Dr. Carson joined the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust to take steps towards effectively ending veteran homelessness in South Florida. Ending homelessness requires creating a system that ensures homelessness is rare, brief, and non-recurring. Miami-Dade County is joining a national movement, along with 63 other communities, to end veteran homelessness. This is not an easy task, but progress has been made in reducing veteran homelessness through the efforts of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and others.
