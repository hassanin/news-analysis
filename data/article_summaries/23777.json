In this message, President Barack Obama informs Congress that he has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared on March 15, 1995, will continue beyond March 15, 2011. The President believes that the crisis between the United States and Iran has not been resolved and that the actions and policies of the Iranian government are contrary to the interests of the United States. He determines that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain comprehensive sanctions against Iran to address the threat it poses to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States.
