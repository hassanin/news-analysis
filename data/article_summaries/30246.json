President Donald Trump has issued a statement declaring the continuation of a national emergency regarding the situation in Nicaragua. This national emergency was initially declared on November 27, 2018, in response to the violent government response to protests and the dismantling of democratic institutions by the Ortega regime. The ongoing situation, including the use of violence and repressive tactics against civilians, corruption, and the destabilization of Nicaragua's economy, still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. As a result, President Trump has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This declaration will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
