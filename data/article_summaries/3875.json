In honor of National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. acknowledges the courage, strength, and resilience of individuals facing Alzheimer's. He recognizes the support of families and caregivers and pledges to continue advancing scientific research and treatment options. Alzheimer's remains a leading cause of death in older adults and disproportionately affects African Americans, Latinos, and individuals with Down syndrome. The administration has taken steps to address the disease, including securing funding for research and development, approving a prescription drug that can alter the course of Alzheimer's, and implementing initiatives to improve access to high-quality care and support for caregivers. Efforts are also being made to increase early detection and diagnosis, reduce dementia risk, prevent hospitalizations, and support caregivers. The president calls on the nation to come together, honor those affected by Alzheimer's, and work towards preventing, treating, and eliminating the disease.
