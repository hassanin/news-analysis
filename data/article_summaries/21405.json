The White House expressed concern about the actions of Niger's President Mamadou Tandja, who ruled by ordinance and decree and dissolved the National Assembly and the Constitutional Court in an attempt to retain power beyond his constitutional mandate. The United States believes that these decisions undermine Niger's progress in promoting good governance and the rule of law. The African Union has sent a delegation to Niger to help resolve the political crisis, and the United States will consult with its regional partners and closely monitor the situation.
