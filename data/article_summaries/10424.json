President Obama announced an agreement between Senator Max Baucus and pharmaceutical companies to bring down drug prices for seniors. This agreement is part of the health reform legislation that Congress is expected to enact. Pharmaceutical companies will extend discounts on prescription drugs to seniors who fall within the coverage gap, also known as the "doughnut hole," of Medicare. The agreement is a result of the commitment made by health industry leaders to reduce health spending by $2 trillion over the next decade. This deal will provide significant relief for seniors who currently face high out-of-pocket expenses for medication. President Obama commended House chairmen Henry Waxman, George Miller, and Charles Rangel for addressing this issue in the health reform legislation. This agreement is seen as a tangible example of the type of reform that will lower costs and ensure quality healthcare for all Americans.
