On December 20, 2017, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency regarding serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and was aimed at addressing the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The President has determined that the prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption originating outside the United States continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the country. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2017 will remain in effect beyond December 20, 2020. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, and the notice of continuation will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
