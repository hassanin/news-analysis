The White House hosted a forum on combating human trafficking in supply chains, bringing together leaders from the private sector, NGOs, and the federal government. This is part of President Obama's commitment to combat human trafficking, with a particular focus on issues in supply chains. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) has published updates to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) as required by the President's Executive Order, which establish new safeguards for federal contractors and subcontractors. These include prohibiting recruitment fees and fraudulent practices, requiring a trafficking compliance plan for work over $500,000 outside the US, and certification that neither the contractors nor subcontractors have engaged in trafficking-related activities. The Administration will continue to collaborate with the private sector, civil society, and government partners to fight against human trafficking in all its forms.
