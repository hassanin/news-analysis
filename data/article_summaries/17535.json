The article is a transcript of a press briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney and Jeff Zients, the Federal Chief Performance Officer and the Deputy Director for Management at the Office of Management and Budget. They discuss a legislative proposal to change the way the government manages federal properties in order to save taxpayers billions of dollars. The proposal aims to sell federal properties that are no longer needed and cut through red tape to expedite the process. The goal is to return at least $15 billion to taxpayers. They also mention other efforts to save money, such as curbing uncontrolled growth in contract spending and improving how government buys and utilizes information technology. The proposal will require congressional approval. They also touch on other topics such as the possibility of a no-fly zone in Libya, rising oil prices, and budget negotiations.
