The Biden-Harris Administration is announcing steps to expand offshore wind jobs and local economic development in the US. This includes proposing the first-ever Gulf of Mexico offshore wind lease sale. The actions align with President Biden's clean energy and economic agenda, aiming to revitalize American manufacturing and deliver reliable, affordable power while creating jobs and strengthening energy security. The administration has already attracted billions of dollars in investments for the offshore wind industry and supports the development of the entire supply chain. The President has set ambitious goals of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030 and 15 gigawatts of floating offshore wind by 2035. The administration is also working on implementing provisions of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to further accelerate offshore wind development, including tax credits and investments in infrastructure.
