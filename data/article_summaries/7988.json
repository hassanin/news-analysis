The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has extended the federal eviction moratorium for 90 days, in an effort to provide relief to renters and landlords during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biden-Harris Administration is coordinating with federal agencies such as the Treasury Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to ensure that tenants and landlords receive the assistance they need. The extension of the eviction moratorium is part of the Administration's ongoing efforts to address the economic challenges caused by the pandemic, with $25 billion already allocated for rental assistance and an additional $21.5 billion provided through the American Rescue Plan. The White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator is working with various agencies and offices to implement the housing provisions of the plan.
