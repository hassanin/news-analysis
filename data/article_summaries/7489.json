The United States Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy establishes the executive branch's priorities and rationale for adjudicating the export of conventional arms. The policy aims to strengthen global security, promote shared interests with allies and partners, and reinforce diplomatic relations. It emphasizes the importance of working with trusted actors who will use defense materiel responsibly and share United States interests. The policy also highlights the need to protect human rights, prevent proliferation, and maintain technological advantages. The United States will consider arms transfers on a case-by-case basis, taking into account foreign policy and national security interests. The policy also addresses arms transfers and human rights, arms transfer restraint, and promotion of responsible defense trade. It emphasizes the importance of good security sector governance and encourages recipients of United States arms transfers to demonstrate effective security sector governance. The United States will continue to participate in multilateral arrangements that contribute to the objectives and interests outlined in the policy. Arms transfer decisions will be foreign policy and national security decisions that support broader United States policy objectives. The policy also applies to arms transfers involving emerging technologies. This memorandum supersedes National Security Presidential Memorandum 10 of April 19, 2018 (United States Conventional Arms Transfer Policy).
