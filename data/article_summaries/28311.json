On National HIV Testing Day, the progress made in the fight against HIV is recognized, including efforts to spread awareness about the importance of getting tested. Early detection of HIV is crucial in preventing the advancement of the virus to AIDS. Medical advances have helped over a million Americans with HIV live longer and healthier lives, and generic medications have been approved to reduce the risk of infection. However, in 2016, nearly 40,000 people were diagnosed with HIV in the US, with a significant number of diagnoses among those aged 20-29. Additionally, 44% of people aged 13-24 living with HIV were unaware of their infection. National HIV Testing Day serves as a reminder that those who are unaware of their status are at the highest risk of unknowingly infecting others and missing out on life-saving treatments. It is encouraged for all Americans to invest in their health and be aware of their HIV status through greater awareness and education.
