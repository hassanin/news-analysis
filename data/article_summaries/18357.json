President Obama has launched the "Educate to Innovate" campaign, which aims to improve science and math achievement among American students over the next decade. The campaign includes partnerships with leading companies, foundations, non-profits, and science and engineering societies to inspire and motivate young people in science and math. The partnerships involve over $260 million in financial and in-kind support and will use media, interactive games, hands-on learning, and volunteers to reach more than 10 million students. The campaign also includes commitments from leaders in various fields to increase support for STEM education and an annual science fair at the White House. The Obama Administration has identified increasing STEM literacy, improving the quality of teaching, and expanding opportunities for underrepresented groups as priorities in STEM education. The President's $4.35 billion Race to the Top program provides a competitive advantage to states that commit to improving STEM education. Public-private partnerships, such as Time Warner Cable's "Connect a Million Minds" campaign and Discovery Communications' "Be the Future" campaign, are among the initiatives announced by the President. Sesame Street is also launching an early STEM literacy initiative, and National Lab Day aims to bring hands-on learning to 10 million students. Additionally, there will be national STEM game design competitions to encourage the development of STEM-related video games.
