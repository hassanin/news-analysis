This article is a readout of President Obama's visit to FEMA's National Response Coordination Center. During a video teleconference, the President received updates from governors and emergency managers in areas affected by Hurricane Irene along the east coast. The VTCs are held daily during major federal responses and have been taking place since Monday. The President's participation in this particular VTC was not previously announced. The VTCs are attended by governors or their representatives, as well as emergency managers and federal agencies involved in the response. Governors from Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts participated in the VTC and provided updates for their states. The President was thanked by governors and state and local representatives for the emergency declarations that have been granted to support preparations and response efforts. The President also inquired about any unmet needs, and while no immediate additional requirements were identified, he directed Administrator Fugate and Secretary Napolitano to remain vigilant as the storm progressed, including addressing any additional sheltering needs.
