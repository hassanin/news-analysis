President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 18 to May 24, 2013, as National Safe Boating Week in the United States. The purpose of this week is to raise awareness about responsible boating and encourage boaters to take necessary precautions. Some of the recommended safety measures include filing a float plan, getting a free vessel safety check, participating in a boating safety course, checking the marine forecast before setting off, and ensuring that all passengers wear life jackets. The President also emphasizes the importance of not operating a boat under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The proclamation recognizes boating as an important part of the national heritage and calls for the continuation of safe boating practices to protect lakes, rivers, and oceans for everyone's enjoyment.
