In his weekly message, President Obama reflects on the progress made in the past year and expresses his commitment to continue working on unfinished issues, particularly the epidemic of gun violence. He acknowledges that Congress has repeatedly failed to pass laws to reduce gun violence and has tasked his team at the White House to identify new actions he can take. He will meet with the Attorney General to discuss options. The President calls on everyone to join him in the fight to reduce gun violence, emphasizing that it will take the collective effort of all to make the United States safer for our children.
