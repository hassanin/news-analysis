President Obama has directed the Department of Labor to propose a rule that would require retirement advisers to act in the best interest of their clients, putting their clients' interests before their own profits. This is in response to the current system where financial advisers may benefit from backdoor payments and hidden fees, leading them to recommend bad retirement investments with high costs and low returns. The conflicts of interest in the current system result in annual losses of 1 percentage point for affected investors, which can have a significant impact on their retirement savings. The proposed rule would help protect middle class families from receiving bad retirement advice and potentially losing out on significant amounts of their savings. The Department of Labor will seek public feedback on the proposed rule in the coming months.
