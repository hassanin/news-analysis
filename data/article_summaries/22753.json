President Obama held a press conference at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. to discuss the progress made in securing nuclear material and to address other foreign policy issues. He highlighted the significant achievements in securing the world's nuclear material over the past six years, including the removal of highly enriched uranium and plutonium from more than 50 facilities in 30 countries. He also emphasized the importance of international cooperation and the need to continue working towards nuclear security, as there is still a great deal of nuclear material that needs to be secured. President Obama also addressed the issue of terrorism and the importance of information-sharing among nations to prevent terrorist attacks, particularly those involving weapons of mass destruction. He expressed concern over recent statements made by a Republican presidential candidate regarding the possibility of Japan and South Korea acquiring nuclear weapons, stating that such statements show a lack of understanding of foreign policy and nuclear issues. Finally, President Obama discussed the importance of maintaining a strong relationship with Turkey, while also expressing concerns about the country's approach to press freedom and democracy. He emphasized the need for Turkey to continue to pursue democracy and openness, while also working together in the fight against ISIS.
