Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed a group of leaders to the White House to discuss the importance of the right to vote. She emphasized that the right to vote is a given and a fundamental right of citizenship. She expressed concern over attempts to interfere with this right, citing the recent example of Texas. Harris stated that the administration is committed to protecting the voices of those who seek to preserve the right to vote and will do everything in their power to ensure access to voting. She stressed that this is not a partisan issue but an American issue that affects people from all walks of life, including those with disabilities, seniors, and students. Harris also mentioned the importance of passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the For the People Act to reinstate protections and prevent further attacks on voting rights. The discussion focused on Senate Bill 7, which Harris argued would make it difficult for people to vote. She praised the leaders in attendance for their courage in speaking up for the people and expressed gratitude for their work.
