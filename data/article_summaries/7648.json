The speaker begins by expressing gratitude for the opportunity to discuss President Biden's competition agenda. They highlight President Biden's Executive Order on Competition, which emphasizes the importance of open and fair competition in American capitalism. The speaker draws parallels to the antitrust efforts of Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt, who understood the need to reshape the regulatory framework to prevent market dominance and promote competition.

The speaker acknowledges that the competitive attributes of the American economy have been declining over the years, leading to fewer options for consumers and workers. They emphasize the need to reverse these trends and drive structural changes that promote competition, innovation, productivity, and opportunity. The speaker cites academic research that demonstrates the loss of competition and rising corporate concentration in the economy, leading to increased market power and higher prices for consumers.

The speaker highlights the work that has been done in the past year to address these competition challenges. They mention the 72 specific actions directed by the Executive Order, which have targeted various sectors such as non-compete agreements, occupational licensing requirements, prescription drugs, internet bills, airline tickets, and more. These actions aim to open up markets, remove regulatory barriers, and encourage competition.

The speaker also emphasizes the importance of antitrust enforcement and the role of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in vigorously enforcing antitrust laws. They acknowledge the need for resources to rebuild the capabilities of these agencies and mention recent legal victories against mergers that would have raised prices.

Furthermore, the speaker discusses the establishment of the White House Competition Council, which includes 17 federal agencies and aims to institutionalize competition policy as part of overall economic policy. They highlight the collaboration and cross-pollination between agencies facilitated by the Council, leading to innovative approaches to enforcement and the setting of priorities in critical areas such as ocean shipping and the tech sector.

The speaker addresses some misconceptions, stating that their approach is not based on a belief that "big is bad" or that competition is the singular cure for inflation. They emphasize that market structure matters and that promoting competition is one tool that can help lower price pressures in the economy.

In conclusion, the speaker emphasizes the need to continue the work of promoting competition and making structural changes to serve America's economic dynamism. They express optimism about the future and call for the recruitment of talent to drive this work. They believe that with the right efforts, America can once again recalibrate its competitiveness and create a more resilient and competitive economy.
