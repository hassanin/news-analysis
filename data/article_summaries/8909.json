On April 15, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared a national emergency in response to harmful foreign activities conducted by the Russian government. These activities include undermining democratic elections, engaging in cyber attacks, promoting corruption, targeting dissidents and journalists, and violating international law. The national emergency was expanded in scope on March 8, 2022, and additional steps were taken on August 20, 2021, March 11, 2022, and April 6, 2022. President Biden has now announced that the national emergency will continue for another year, as these harmful activities still pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This notice has been published in the Federal Register and will be transmitted to Congress.
