In a speech delivered on October 13, 2017, President Donald Trump announced a new strategy to address the "destructive actions" of the Iranian regime. He emphasized that the United States will work with its allies to counter Iran's destabilizing activities and support for terrorist proxies in the region. The President also mentioned that additional sanctions will be imposed on the regime to block its financing of terrorism, and efforts will be made to address Iran's proliferation of missiles and weapons. Trump criticized the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, calling it one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. He expressed concern over Iran's continued development of its nuclear program and called for the deal's flaws to be addressed. The President stated that if a solution cannot be reached with Congress and allies, the agreement will be terminated. Trump concluded his speech by expressing solidarity with the Iranian people and hoping for a future of peace and prosperity in the Middle East.
