President Donald J. Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13851 regarding the situation in Nicaragua will continue beyond November 27, 2020. The violent response by the Nicaraguan government to protests, as well as its dismantling of democratic institutions, use of indiscriminate violence, repression of civilians, and corruption leading to economic destabilization, are cited as reasons for the national emergency to remain in effect.
