President Biden has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in Nicaragua will continue beyond November 27, 2023. The decision is based on the violent response by the Nicaraguan government to protests, the dismantling of democratic institutions, the use of violence against civilians, and corruption leading to economic destabilization. President Biden believes that these actions pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
