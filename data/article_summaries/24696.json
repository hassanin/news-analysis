In a statement from Press Secretary Robert Gibbs on June 14, 2009, the White House expressed support for Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech. The President welcomed the speech as an important step forward and reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution, with a Jewish state of Israel and an independent Palestine. The President believes that this solution is necessary to ensure both Israel's security and the fulfillment of the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations for a viable state. The President will continue to work with all parties involved, including Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Arab states, and Quartet partners, to fulfill their obligations and responsibilities in order to achieve a two-state solution and comprehensive regional peace.
