President Biden has announced new domestic steps to further strengthen supply chain resilience. These steps include holding a Summit on Global Supply Chain Resilience with the European Union and 14 other countries, expanding port operating hours on the U.S. west coast, establishing an Early Warning System for potential disruptions in semiconductor manufacturing, and forming a new public-private alliance called Li-Bridge to develop a secure domestic supply chain for lithium-based batteries. These actions build on the President's previous Executive Order to build resilient supply chains and aim to address immediate challenges while also creating long-term supply chain reliance. The Summit will involve discussions on how to tackle supply chain challenges during the economic recovery.
