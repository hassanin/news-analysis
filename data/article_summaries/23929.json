First Lady Michelle Obama has announced a nationwide commitment to get over 1.7 million American children active as part of her Let's Move! initiative to combat childhood obesity. This commitment is made through partnerships with various organizations, including the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), U.S. Paralympics, and USOC National Governing Bodies for sport. These organizations will provide beginner athletic programming to children across the country. The Partnership for a Healthier America (PHA) has also created a website to help families find affiliated sports programs in their area. Mrs. Obama, who will lead the Presidential Delegation to the 2012 Olympic Games in London, aims to turn the inspiration of the games into action by encouraging kids to get healthy and active. The Let's Move! initiative is a comprehensive effort to engage every sector of society in tackling childhood obesity.
