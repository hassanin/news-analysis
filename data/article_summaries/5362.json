President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency in Afghanistan due to the widespread humanitarian crisis in the country. This includes the urgent needs of the Afghan people for various basic necessities such as food security, livelihood support, water, sanitation, health, hygiene, shelter, settlement assistance, and COVID-19-related aid. The Executive Order aims to address this emergency by blocking all property and interests in property of the Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) held in the United States by any US financial institution, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The blocked property will be transferred into a consolidated account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
