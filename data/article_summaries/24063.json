The President called Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand to thank him for successfully chairing the meeting of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) leaders in Bali, Indonesia on October 8. They discussed the productive outcomes from the meeting and welcomed the agreement among the twelve member nations to work towards concluding negotiations this year. They also committed to intensifying efforts to reach that goal. The TPP Leaders Statement noted that this comprehensive and high standard agreement is a model for future trade agreements and a promising pathway to building a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific, which is a goal of APEC.
