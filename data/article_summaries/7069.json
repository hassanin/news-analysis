President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has declared an emergency due to threats to the availability of sufficient electricity generation capacity in the United States. Factors such as disruptions to energy markets caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change have contributed to the challenges. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation have both warned of near-term electricity reliability concerns. To ensure electric resource adequacy, utilities and grid operators must engage in advance planning to build new capacity. Solar energy has been a rapidly growing source of new electric generation, but the unavailability of solar cells and modules jeopardizes planned additions. The majority of solar modules installed in the United States are imported, particularly from Southeast Asia, but the country has been unable to import sufficient quantities recently. This shortage puts at risk near-term solar capacity additions necessary to meet electricity generation needs and combat rising energy prices. The federal government is working with the private sector to promote the expansion of domestic solar manufacturing capacity, but immediate action is needed to ensure access to a sufficient supply of solar modules. President Biden has invoked emergency authority to provide additional authority to the Secretary of Commerce to respond to the declared emergency. The Secretary may take appropriate action to permit the importation of certain solar cells and modules from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, free of duties, to address the shortage. The proclamation is implemented subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations.
