The author expresses deep disappointment in the recent decision by the United States Supreme Court that weakens the Voting Rights Act and perpetuates racial disparities in voting opportunities. They argue that this decision, along with the recent blocking of the For the People Act by Senate Republicans, undermines voting rights and the promise of democracy. The author believes that additional laws are needed to protect the integrity and independence of the election system, as well as to address threats of election subversion. They emphasize the importance of continuing the fight for voting protections through legislation such as the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The author concludes by urging a coalition of Americans from all backgrounds and political parties to come together and demand a democracy that truly reflects the will of the people.
