Shaun Donovan, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), has announced that HUD is granting $2 billion in funds from the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) to states, local governments, and non-profit developers. The funds aim to promote economic development in communities severely affected by the economic crisis and generate employment. Nearly 60 beneficiaries will receive the grants. The NSP grants, funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, are awarded through a bidding process to applicants with innovative ideas to rebuild local communities and demonstrate responsible stewardship of taxpayer money. The grants will help stabilize communities by converting foreclosed homes into affordable housing opportunities. The NSP was created to redevelop severely affected communities, create jobs, and promote the development of local economies by providing resources to purchase and remodel foreclosed homes. Last year, HUD granted nearly $4 billion in NSP funds to over 300 beneficiaries nationwide. In addition, $50 million in technical assistance grants were provided to help beneficiaries effectively manage the inventory of foreclosed homes purchased through the NSP. The grants aim to assist with fiscal, administrative, and financial management, evaluate outcomes, increase public-private partnerships, develop strategies to assist low-income families, incorporate energy efficiency, support land banks, and train NSP beneficiaries on HUD program requirements and financial management. The Recovery Act, signed into law by President Obama in February 2009, has already provided nearly $100 billion in tax relief, helped close budget gaps for severely affected local and state governments, and supported thousands of projects that create jobs and lay the foundation for long-term economic growth.
