President Biden has announced five new federal judicial nominees who are highly qualified, experienced, and committed to upholding the rule of law and the Constitution. These nominations reflect the President's commitment to diversifying the nation's courts in terms of personal and professional backgrounds. If confirmed, Ana Reyes would be the first Hispanic woman and openly LGBTQ person to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. This is President Biden's seventeenth round of nominees, bringing the total number of announced federal judicial nominees to 95. The President has prioritized filling judicial vacancies and has had the most lower court judges confirmed in the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration. The nominees include Circuit Court Judge Sarah A. L. Merriam, who has served as a U.S. District Court Judge for the District of Connecticut since 2021. District Court nominees include Judge Elizabeth Hanes, who has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia since 2020, and Anne M. Nardacci, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP in Albany, New York. Ana C. Reyes, a partner at Williams & Connolly LLP in Washington, D.C., and Lara E. Montecalvo, the Public Defender of Rhode Island, are also nominated for District Court positions.
