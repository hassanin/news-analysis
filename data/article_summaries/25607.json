President Trump has signed an Executive Order to establish the National Council for the American Worker, which is tasked with developing a national strategy for training and retraining workers in high-demand industries. The Council aims to increase access to job data and raise awareness of workforce issues, such as the skills crisis and the importance of STEM education. More than 20 companies and associations have signed the Pledge to America's Workers, committing to creating new opportunities for American students and workers through apprenticeships, on-the-job training, and reskilling.
