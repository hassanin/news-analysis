President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Utah due to straight-line winds that occurred from September 7 to September 8, 2020. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The counties of Salt Lake, Weber, Davis, and Morgan are eligible for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Kenneth G. Clark has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
