This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on January 31, 2020, addresses the exploitation of e-commerce by traffickers and the evasion of customs duties, taxes, and fees by foreign exporters and U.S. importers. The order aims to protect consumers, intellectual property rights holders, businesses, and workers from counterfeit goods, narcotics, and other contraband. It establishes criteria for importers to obtain an importer of record number and states that any person debarred or suspended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for importation-related reasons shall be ineligible for an importer of record number. The order also outlines the responsibilities of express consignment operators, carriers, hub facilities, and licensed customs brokers to notify CBP of any attempt by ineligible persons to re-establish business activity requiring an importer of record number. It directs the United States Postal Service (USPS) to collaborate with the Secretary of State to notify the international postal network of the U.S. government's policy and provisions regarding importers of record. The order requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, through CBP, to develop a compliance metric for international posts and implement appropriate measures to prevent the importation of shipments from non-compliant posts. It also calls for the publication of information about seizures involving intellectual property rights violations, illegal drugs, and other contraband in the international mail and express consignment environments. The order assigns resources to prioritize the prosecution of import violations and mandates a report on the sufficiency of fees collected by CBP. The order includes definitions for key terms and contains general provisions regarding its implementation.
