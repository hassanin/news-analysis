The United States has expressed serious concern over the Cambodian government's dissolution of the main opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). The government's actions, based on unfounded allegations of a conspiracy to overthrow it, have restricted civil society, suppressed the press, and banned over 100 opposition leaders from political activities. These actions have hindered Cambodia's democratic development and put its economic growth and international standing at risk. The United States plans to respond to these actions by terminating support for the Cambodian National Election Committee and its administration of the 2018 national election, as it is expected to be neither legitimate, free, nor fair. The Cambodian government is urged to reverse its actions, release imprisoned CNRP leader Kem Sokha, and allow opposition parties, civil society, and the media to continue their legitimate activities.
