The press secretary released a statement announcing a significant drop in illegal border apprehensions, which they attribute to President Trump's commitment to securing the border and supporting law enforcement. The Trump Administration is expanding the border patrol, cracking down on sanctuary cities, and directing resources towards building a southern border wall. In March 2017, there were 16,600 individuals apprehended or deemed inadmissible, a 35% decrease from February and a 61% decrease from January. This represents a 64% decrease from the same month last year.
