President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Indiana due to a severe winter storm that occurred from January 26-28, 2009. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, as well as the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding. Regis Leo Phelan has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-4600.
