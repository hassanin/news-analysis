President Donald J. Trump spoke about the benefits of tax cuts for middle-income families, including an expanded standard deduction, increased child tax credit, and lower tax rates. The tax plan also aims to help small businesses, with more than 99% of them facing the lowest top marginal tax rate in over 80 years. Tax reform is expected to lead to higher economic growth, wages, and job creation. The current tax code is seen as burdensome and complex, costing the economy $262 billion annually and making U.S. businesses less competitive.
