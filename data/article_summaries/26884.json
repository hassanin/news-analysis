Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Rep. Bradley Byrne have proposed the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act, which aims to provide students with more options and freedom in their education. The program would offer a federal income tax credit for contributions to nonprofit organizations that provide scholarships for individual elementary and secondary school students. The scholarships would allow students to access various educational opportunities, such as dual enrollment, special education services, advanced courses, and career and technical education. The proposal emphasizes the importance of personalized education and empowering students and parents to make decisions about their education. The authors argue that this program is not an attack on public education but rather an opportunity to enhance and improve existing options.
