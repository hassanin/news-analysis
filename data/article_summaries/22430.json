This article is a copy of an order signed by President Barack Obama regarding the acquisition of four U.S. wind farm project companies by Ralls Corporation. The President states that there is credible evidence suggesting that Ralls Corporation and its subsidiaries, along with the Sany Group (a Chinese company affiliated with Ralls) and its senior executives Mr. Dawei Duan and Mr. Jialing Wu, might take actions that threaten U.S. national security. The President orders that the acquisition of the project companies by Ralls Corporation is prohibited, and Ralls must divest all interests in the project companies and their assets within 90 days. The order also requires the removal of any items or structures from the properties where the wind farms were proposed to be constructed, and prohibits the sale or transfer of any items produced by the Sany Group to third parties for use at the properties. The Companies and individuals acting on their behalf are prohibited from accessing the properties, except for U.S. citizens contracted by the Companies for the purpose of fulfilling the removal requirements. The order also establishes that CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) is authorized to implement measures to verify compliance with the order. The Attorney General is authorized to enforce the order, and the President reserves the right to issue further orders to protect national security.
