President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation designating May 15th as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 12th to May 18th as Police Week. The proclamation honors the men and women who serve as police officers and recognizes their sacrifices. It calls for Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities and encourages the flag to be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of supporting law enforcement by putting cops back on the beat, providing them with necessary tools and training, and implementing measures to reduce gun violence.
