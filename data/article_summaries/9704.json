This article is a notice from the President of the United States, Barack Obama, regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Belarus. The national emergency was declared in 2006 due to the actions and policies of certain members of the Belarusian government and other individuals undermining democratic processes or institutions, committing human rights abuses, and engaging in public corruption. Despite some progress, serious challenges remain, and the national emergency must continue for another year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
