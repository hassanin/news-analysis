The United States is expressing concern over China's new Law on the Management of Foreign NGO Activities, stating that it will limit civil society in China and restrict contact between individuals and organizations in the US and China. The US government believes that a vibrant civil society is important for stability and prosperity, and has consistently supported the role of civil society in China. They are urging China to respect the rights and freedoms of human rights defenders, journalists, business groups, development professionals, and all others involved in civil society, and to protect the ability of foreign NGOs to operate in China.
