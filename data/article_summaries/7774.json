The US government successfully facilitated the departure of American citizens and lawful permanent residents from Afghanistan on a Qatar Airways flight. The flight landed safely in Qatar, and the US government expressed gratitude to Qatar for their assistance. The Taliban has cooperated in allowing the departure of Americans on charter flights and has been described as flexible, businesslike, and professional in the process. The US government will continue its efforts to ensure the safe travel of American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and Afghan allies who wish to leave Afghanistan. Due to ongoing terrorist threats, specific details of these efforts will not be shared until people are safely out of the country. So far, over 6,000 American citizens and lawful permanent residents have been brought back to the US under Operation Allies Welcome. President Biden has emphasized that there is no deadline for American citizens who wish to leave Afghanistan, and the US government remains committed to assisting them.
