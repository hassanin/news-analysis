The President believes in attracting and retaining good jobs in the US by rewarding companies that bring jobs back to America. He proposed a legislation that would give companies a tax credit for moving operations back to the US, funded by eliminating deductions for moving operations overseas. Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress blocked this proposal, choosing to play politics instead of encouraging job creation and strengthening the middle class. The administration will continue to push for Congress to act on proposals like this, as well as other parts of the President's American Jobs Act, which economists say could create a million new American jobs. The statement calls on Republicans in Congress to stop obstructing these common-sense proposals and take action to create jobs in the US.
