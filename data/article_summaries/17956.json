President Barack Obama has issued a Presidential Proclamation declaring January 2017 as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month. The proclamation recognizes the ongoing issue of modern slavery and human trafficking, both globally and within the United States. It calls for efforts to shine a light on these crimes and protect the basic rights and freedoms of victims. The proclamation highlights the various vulnerable populations that are targeted by traffickers, such as migrants, refugees, homeless LGBT youth, and children in poverty. The United States government has taken steps to combat human trafficking, including the creation of the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of addressing the consequences and root causes of human trafficking, as well as the need for international cooperation. It calls upon businesses, organizations, families, and all Americans to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities to raise awareness and combat slavery and human trafficking.
