The Biden Administration has released the first full-color image from the Webb Space Telescope, which has captured the highest-resolution images of the infrared universe ever. The telescope, launched in December 2021, is now orbiting the Sun one million miles away from Earth. The image, called "Webb's First Deep Field," shows galaxies that are over 13 billion years old, formed just after the Big Bang. In the coming days, NASA will release additional images revealing details about exoplanet atmospheres, star formation, interacting galaxies, black holes, and the death of stars. The Webb Space Telescope is an international program led by NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency. It will study cosmic history over the past 13.5 billion years, from our solar system to the early universe. The telescope is a result of the collaboration of thousands of engineers, scientists, universities, organizations, and companies. President Biden and Vice President Harris were briefed on the images by NASA officials, highlighting the importance of U.S. government leadership and international partnerships in scientific discoveries. The Biden-Harris Administration aims to restore scientific integrity and engage Americans in science and technology solutions.
