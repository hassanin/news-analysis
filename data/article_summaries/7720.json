On the anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death, the United States expresses solidarity with the Iranian people who have been killed, wounded, or imprisoned for peacefully demanding democracy and human rights. Mahsa's story has inspired the Woman, Life, Freedom movement, advocating for gender equality and human rights in Iran and globally. The United States remains committed to supporting Iranians in their fight for a free and democratic future. They will determine their country's fate, but the US will stand with them and provide tools for advocacy. The US will also speak out against gender-based violence and support women human rights defenders. The US has taken diplomatic actions against the Iranian government, provided safe haven for activists, facilitated internet access, and imposed sanctions on human rights abusers. On this day, the US reaffirms its commitment to the courageous people of Iran and stands with them, along with allies and partners.
