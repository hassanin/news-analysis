President Obama has signed a memorandum to modernize the management of government records, directing agencies to move into a digital-based records keeping system. This move aims to save taxpayer dollars, promote accountability, and increase government transparency. The current federal records management system, which relies on paper and filing cabinets, is outdated. The memorandum calls for a comprehensive assessment of agency systems for collecting, maintaining, and preserving records, with reports due within the next 120 days. The goal is to improve records management programs, identify obstacles, and outline potential reforms. The directive will focus on making records management more cost-effective and accessible to the public, as well as transitioning from paper-based to electronic records where appropriate. The Director of OMB and the National Archivist will consult with both government and public stakeholders interested in improving records management and open government.
