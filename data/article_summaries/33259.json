This article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Donald J. Trump on April 12, 2018, regarding the implementation of air quality standards in the United States. The memorandum focuses on the timely processing of State Implementation Plans (SIPs), cooperative engagement with states in reviewing Regional Haze Plans, timely processing of preconstruction permit applications, demonstrations or petitions relating to emissions beyond the control of state and local air agencies, monitoring and modeling data usage, flexibility in identifying and achieving offsets, future National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) reviews, timely issuance of implementing regulations and guidance, and the review of rules, guidance, memoranda, and procedures relating to State Implementation Plans and permitting. The memorandum aims to ensure efficient and cost-effective implementation of air quality standards while reducing unnecessary impediments to new manufacturing and business expansion.
