The article discusses the first-ever whole-of-government strategy by the United States to address the risks and benefits associated with digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. The market for digital assets has seen significant growth, with a market cap of over $3 trillion. Around 16 percent of adult Americans, or approximately 40 million people, have invested in or used cryptocurrencies. Over 100 countries are exploring or piloting Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).

The rise of digital assets presents an opportunity for American leadership in the global financial system and technology, but also poses risks related to consumer protection, financial stability, national security, and climate change. The United States aims to maintain technological leadership, support innovation, and mitigate risks for consumers, businesses, and the financial system. Additionally, the US seeks to play a leading role in international engagement and global governance of digital assets.

To address these priorities, President Biden will sign an Executive Order that outlines a national policy for digital assets. The Order focuses on six key priorities: consumer and investor protection, financial stability, illicit finance, US leadership in the global financial system and economic competitiveness, financial inclusion, and responsible innovation.

The Executive Order calls for measures to establish policies that guard against risks and promote responsible innovation. The administration will work with agencies, Congress, and the private sector to develop aligned international capabilities, respond to national security risks, and support technological advancements in digital assets.
