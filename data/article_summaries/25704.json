According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States will surpass Russia to become the world's largest oil producer by 2023. The IEA predicts that U.S. crude production will reach a record of 12.1 million barrels per day in 2023, up from the current level of around 11 million barrels per day. This growth is attributed to technological advances, improved efficiency, and a recovery in oil prices, which has encouraged shale companies to increase drilling. The U.S. is also expected to increase its influence on global oil markets, with oil exports more than doubling to 4.9 million barrels per day by 2023. Overall, U.S. production, including all liquids, is projected to rise to nearly 17 million barrels per day over the next five years.
