When asked about the possibility of impeaching Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Gidley referred reporters to Congress and the Department of Justice for further information. He also stated that the President wants transparency and cooperation from the DOJ. Gidley could not confirm reports of North Korea returning U.S. remains, but mentioned that it was a topic discussed at the summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un. In response to a question about a possible U.S. strike on Iran, Gidley referred reporters to the Department of Defense and emphasized the President's stance on Iran's destabilizing actions and nuclear ambitions. Gidley also addressed questions about a CNN reporter being barred from a White House event, the Michael Cohen tapes, the $12 billion fund for farmers impacted by tariffs, and the President's relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He concluded the briefing by stating that the President has the legal authority to endorse candidates during official events and that readouts of calls with foreign leaders will continue to be provided in various forms.
