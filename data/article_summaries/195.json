The Biden-Harris Administration has released the National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology, aiming to strengthen the US foundation for safeguarding consumer technology and promoting US leadership in international standards development. The strategy focuses on four key objectives to prioritize standards development for critical and emerging technologies. The US private sector, led by organizations like the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), plays a significant role in standards activities. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 provides funding for semiconductor research and development, which will enhance US influence in international standards development. The US government has already committed to leading and coordinating international efforts through partnerships and cooperation mechanisms. The actions outlined in the strategy align with national security and cybersecurity strategies and will protect standards development integrity while ensuring long-term US innovation success.
