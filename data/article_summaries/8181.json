Vice President Kamala Harris recently held a roundtable discussion in Chicago, Illinois, with various stakeholders to address reproductive health care and abortion access following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs case. The Vice President acknowledged the efforts of participants in protecting reproductive rights in Illinois and commended them for providing care to women from other states where access is restricted. Concerns were raised about the spread of misinformation and the negative impact of Dobbs on the health care workforce, including training future professionals and the well-being of providers. The Vice President has been actively engaging with leaders nationwide in the fight to protect reproductive rights, holding over 20 convenings since May and meeting with state legislators, health care providers, legal experts, faith leaders, and various advocates.
