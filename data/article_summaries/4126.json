The Biden administration is requesting a $33 billion supplemental budget from Congress to support Ukraine. The funding will be allocated for military and security assistance, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and food security. The goal is to provide Ukraine with the resources needed to defend against Russian aggression and support its basic functions. The request also includes provisions to seize assets of Russian oligarchs and elites, with the proceeds going to Ukraine. The administration emphasizes the importance of bipartisan support and continued aid to Ukraine. The call was on background and embargoed until 10:30 a.m. EDT.
