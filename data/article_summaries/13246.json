The Obama Administration is launching competitions to create three new manufacturing innovation institutes with a Federal commitment of $200 million across five Federal agencies â€“ Defense, Energy, Commerce, NASA, and the National Science Foundation. These institutes will serve as regional hubs that bridge the gap between basic research and product development, bringing together companies, universities, community colleges, and Federal agencies to co-invest in technology areas that encourage investment and production in the U.S. The Department of Defense will lead two of the new institutes focused on "Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation" and "Lightweight and Modern Metals Manufacturing", and the Department of Energy will lead one new institute on "Next Generation Power Electronics Manufacturing". These institutes will be selected through an open, competitive process, and winning teams will be announced later this year. Federal funds will be matched by industry co-investment, support from state and local governments, and other sources. The goal is to make these institutes financially self-sustaining.
