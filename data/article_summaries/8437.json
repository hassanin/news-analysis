In a teleconference, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed community leaders, labor leaders, and state and local elected officials to discuss the debt ceiling. She emphasized the importance of preventing the United States from defaulting on its debt, as this would have severe consequences for the economy and everyday Americans. Harris criticized congressional Republicans for using the debt ceiling as a political tactic, pointing out that if they truly cared about reducing the nation's debt, they wouldn't fight to protect tax cuts for the wealthy. She highlighted that defaulting on the debt could trigger a recession, impact military paychecks, raise interest rates, and put programs like Social Security and Medicare at risk. Harris urged the leaders on the call to make their voices heard and raise awareness about the potential consequences of defaulting on the debt. She emphasized that in the United States, the government pays its bills, and with the support of the leaders on the call, the nation will not default on its debt.
