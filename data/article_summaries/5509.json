The Biden-Harris Administration is taking new actions to protect renters and strengthen tenant protections in the rental market. These actions include ensuring fair tenant screening practices, funding tenant education and outreach, providing more time for tenants to avoid eviction, increasing resident engagement requirements, and ensuring renters have a seat at the table in policy discussions. The administration is also encouraging private sector and state and local governments to take action to improve the quality of life for renters. These actions build on previous efforts by the administration to address housing affordability and protect renters. The administration is calling for congressional action to codify renters' rights into law and to pass the President's budget proposal, which includes investments in lowering housing costs, expanding housing supply, and eviction prevention.
