President Obama held a conference call with the National Security Council to discuss the situation in Egypt. He expressed concern over the violence and political polarization in the country. The United States does not support any specific Egyptian political party or group and rejects false claims that it is trying to dictate Egypt's transition. The US remains committed to the Egyptian people and their aspirations for democracy. They call on all Egyptians to come together in an inclusive process that allows for the participation of all groups and political parties. The US urges Egyptian leaders to condemn the use of force and prevent further violence, while also calling on demonstrators to protest peacefully. The goal is to bridge Egypt's divisions, reject reprisals, and restore stability and democracy.
