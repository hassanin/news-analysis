The National Security Council Spokesperson, Bernadette Meehan, released a statement acknowledging the 25th anniversary of the fall of communism in Romania. The statement recognizes the bravery of the Romanian citizens who rose against the repressive regime and demanded their freedom. It also highlights the sacrifice of over a thousand Romanians who lost their lives in December 1989, which ultimately led to the ouster of the last communist regime in a Warsaw Pact nation and the fall of the Iron Curtain. The statement emphasizes the positive changes Romania has undergone since then, including the exercise of their right to choose their leaders and their transformation from a captive nation to a NATO Ally. The spokesperson congratulates the people of Romania on this historic anniversary and expresses a commitment to continue working together to advance security, prosperity, and freedom in the region and globally.
