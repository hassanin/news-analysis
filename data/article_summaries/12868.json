President Obama announced a new national fuel efficiency policy aimed at increasing fuel economy and reducing greenhouse gas pollution for all new cars and trucks sold in the United States. The new standards, covering model years 2012-2016, require an average fuel economy standard of 35.5 mpg in 2016, surpassing the previous CAFE law requirement of 35 mpg in 2020. The policy is expected to save 1.8 billion barrels of oil over the program's lifetime and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 900 million metric tons. The policy is a result of collaboration between the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, auto manufacturers, the United Auto Workers, and environmental and state governments. It provides regulatory certainty, predictability, and cost reductions for the auto industry, while also promoting energy independence and reducing air pollution.
