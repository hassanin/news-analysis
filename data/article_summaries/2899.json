During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki introduced Brian Deese, the Director of the National Economic Council, who provided context on the President's plan to invest in American families. Deese explained that one element of the plan is to change how capital gains taxes are taxed for taxpayers making more than $1 million per year in income. He emphasized that this change will only affect a small percentage of taxpayers, about 500,000 households in the country. Deese argued that the change is fair and will help reduce tax avoidance by treating capital gains the same as wages for the top 0.3% of income earners. He also noted that there is no evidence that capital gains tax rates significantly impact long-term investment in the economy. In response to questions, Deese stated that the President's focus is on equalizing the treatment of ordinary income and capital gains for the highest-income Americans and that the revenue from this provision would be invested directly in children, families, and future economic competitiveness.
