President Obama has declared a major disaster in Massachusetts and ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following a severe storm and snowstorm in October 2011. The federal funding will be available to local governments and nonprofit organizations for emergency work, facility repairs, and snow assistance. Additionally, federal funding will be provided for hazard mitigation measures. Mark H. Landry has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and further designations may be made based on damage assessments.
