Today is the eighth anniversary of the kidnapping of American journalist Austin Tice, who is also a former Marine Corps officer. The US government has previously asked Syria to assist in finding and returning Tice, and is now calling on Syria again for help. The US, along with coalition partners, has successfully destroyed ISIS' physical caliphate and remains committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people. The recovery and return of Americans missing abroad is a top priority for the US administration, and the Tice family deserves answers. The US stands with the Tice family and is determined to bring Austin home.
