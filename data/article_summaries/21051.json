President Obama issued a statement in 2010 announcing the extension of benefits to same-sex domestic partners of federal employees. He had previously instructed the Office of Personnel Management and the Secretary of State to identify and extend certain benefits to gay and lesbian federal employees and their families. These benefits included long-term care insurance, expanded sick leave, medical care abroad, eligibility for employment at posts, cost-of-living adjustments abroad, and medical evacuation for domestic partners of foreign service members. The President signed a Memorandum requiring executive agencies to immediately take action to extend meaningful benefits to same-sex domestic partners, including family assistance services, hardship transfers, and relocation expenses. The Memorandum also called for equal treatment of opposite-sex spouses and same-sex domestic partners in terms of benefits, to the extent permitted by law. However, the President acknowledged that existing federal law prevented his administration from providing same-sex domestic partners with the full range of benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples. He called for the swift passage of the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act, which would grant same-sex domestic partners of federal employees the same benefits as opposite-sex spouses.
