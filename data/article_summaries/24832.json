President Obama spoke with Prime Minister Cameron of the United Kingdom to discuss the crisis in Ukraine. They were pleased to hear that separatists have agreed to implement the ceasefire declared by President Poroshenko. The leaders stressed the importance of Russia stopping the flow of weapons and militants across the border and using its influence over separatist groups to encourage them to follow President Poroshenko's peace plan. If Russia fails to take immediate steps to deescalate the situation, the United States and the European Union will work together to impose additional measures to put pressure on Russia. They also discussed the situation in Iraq and the threat of ISIL.
