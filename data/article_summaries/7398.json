Beloved German Shepherd, Champ, has passed away peacefully at home. He was a cherished companion to the Biden family for 13 years. Despite his declining health, he always greeted his family with wagging tail and affection. Champ loved being by their side and brought comfort in various settings, whether it was curling up by the fire, attending meetings, or enjoying the White House garden. In his younger years, he enjoyed chasing golf balls and playing with the grandchildren. Champ was a constant source of support and love, understanding his family's emotions in both happy and sad times. He will be dearly missed.
