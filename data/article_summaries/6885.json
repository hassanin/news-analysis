A new analysis by the President's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) shows that the American Rescue Plan's support for child care has significantly reduced child care costs for families. The analysis reveals that a typical family with young children has seen a decrease of over $1,200 per child per year in child care expenses. The Child Care Stabilization program, which was part of the American Rescue Plan, provided historic support to more than 225,000 child care programs serving up to 10 million children across the country. This support helped keep child care centers open for working families who rely on them. The investments made through the program had a benefit-cost ratio of about 2:1, meaning the benefits to the economy outweighed the costs. With the end of the program approaching, the report emphasizes the need for Congress to provide further investment in the child care sector. President Biden and Vice President Harris have called on Congress to provide an additional year of funding for child care stabilization, as well as sustained investments to ensure affordable, high-quality child care for all families and fair compensation for child care workers. The Department of Treasury's 2021 report on the economics of child care supply in the U.S. highlights the underinvestment in the child care sector, which hampers parents' ability to contribute to the economy. The Department of Health and Human Services is also releasing data on the broad reach of the Child Care Stabilization program, showing its impact on child care providers across the country, particularly small women-owned businesses and women of color who make up a significant portion of the child care workforce.
