The article discusses the decision made by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 regarding the stabilization of Iraq. Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act states that a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and transmits it to Congress, stating that the emergency will continue beyond the anniversary date of its declaration. In this case, President Biden has sent a notice to the Federal Register, stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq will continue beyond May 22, 2021. The President's decision is based on the ongoing obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of peace and security, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in the country, which pose a significant threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
