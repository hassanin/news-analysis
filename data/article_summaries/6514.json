President Biden has directed his national security team to conduct a 100-day review of U.S. government efforts to address domestic terrorism, which is currently the most urgent terrorism threat facing the country. As a result of this review, the Biden Administration has released the first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism. The strategy aims to improve the federal government's response to domestic terrorism by understanding and sharing information, preventing recruitment and mobilization to violence, disrupting and deterring terrorist activity, and confronting the long-term contributors to domestic terrorism. The strategy is organized around four pillars: understanding and sharing domestic terrorism-related information, preventing recruitment and mobilization to violence, disrupting and deterring domestic terrorism activity, and confronting long-term contributors to domestic terrorism. The strategy emphasizes the protection of civil rights and civil liberties and involves collaboration with various stakeholders, including Congress, state and local governments, academia, civil society, religious communities, and foreign governments. The strategy also focuses on addressing online terrorist recruitment, increasing support for law enforcement, improving employee screening processes, and confronting racism and bigotry. The Biden Administration is committed to strengthening trust in American democracy, countering polarization, and fostering a healthy information environment.
