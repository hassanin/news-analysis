On December 18, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order stating that all executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government will be closed and their employees excused from duty on Monday, December 24, 2018, the day before Christmas Day. However, the heads of executive departments and agencies have the discretion to determine if certain offices and installations must remain open for reasons of national security, defense, or other public need. The order also states that December 24, 2018, will be considered within the scope of existing statutes regarding the pay and leave of employees. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management is responsible for implementing this order. The order must be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, and it does not create any enforceable right or benefit against the United States or any other party.
