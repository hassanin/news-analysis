The United States and the Netherlands have released a joint statement on climate change and financing the transition to low-carbon investments abroad. Both countries express their commitment to taking urgent action on global climate change and emphasize the importance of reaching a global climate change agreement in 2015. They recognize the role of the private sector, sub-national actors, and civil society in finding solutions to carbon pollution and improving resilience to climate change impacts. The two countries pledge to cooperate towards adopting such an agreement at the United Nations climate conference in Paris in 2015. They also reaffirm their support for scaling up the mobilization of climate finance and acknowledge the need for different forms of financing to support countries transitioning to a low-emission, climate resilient economy. The Netherlands is joining the United States, the United Kingdom, and others in ending support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants abroad, except in rare circumstances. They are also working together to promote a technology-neutral standard in the OECD Export Credit Group that limits support for high carbon intensity power plants by export credit agencies.
