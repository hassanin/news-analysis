President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Alabama and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between January 22-23, 2012. Federal funding will be provided to affected individuals in Chilton and Jefferson Counties, which can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Joe M. Girot as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Damage assessments are still ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated in the future. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can start applying for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling the provided toll-free numbers. The telephone lines will be operational from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time, seven days a week.
