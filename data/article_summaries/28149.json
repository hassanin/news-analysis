The article discusses the growth of worker wages in the United States. It states that while corporate profits declined in the first quarter of 2019, wages grew at an annual rate of 10.1%. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) recently published revised data showing that employee compensation rose 4.5% in 2017 and 5% in 2018, which is higher than previously reported. In the first six months of 2019, compensation increased by $378 billion or 3.4%. Wages and salaries also saw upward revisions, with a growth rate of 5.3% in May year over year and 5.5% in June. The article argues that these numbers refute claims that worker incomes were not growing faster during the Obama administration and suggests that deregulation and tax reform have contributed to the growth of worker wages.
