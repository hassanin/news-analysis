President Barack Obama has declared September 21-27, 2014, as National Farm Safety and Health Week in the United States. The proclamation recognizes the difficult and often dangerous conditions in which farmers and ranchers work and pays tribute to their contributions to the nation. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of ensuring the safety and well-being of agricultural workers and highlights the efforts of the government to mitigate risks and promote farm safety and health programs. The Farm Bill, signed by President Obama, is mentioned as a measure that supports small ranches and family farms and provides crop insurance to protect farmers from disasters. The proclamation concludes by urging agencies, organizations, businesses, and extension services to strengthen their commitment to promoting farm safety and health programs and calling upon Americans to appreciate the contributions of farmers, ranchers, and farmworkers to the nation.
