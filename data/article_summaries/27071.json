First Lady Melania Trump visited the Microsoft Innovation and Policy Center in Washington D.C. as part of her Be Best campaign. She met with students from Microsoft's Council for Digital Good, who provide ideas and feedback for the company's youth-focused online safety policy work. The students had designed art projects representing individual expressions of digital civility, which Mrs. Trump viewed and discussed with the students. She also participated in a listening session where she learned about the 15 tenets of responsible digital behavior established by the teen council. Mrs. Trump praised the students for their positive leadership in the digital world and thanked Microsoft for the opportunity to visit.
