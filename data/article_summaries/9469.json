This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, dated June 20, 2013. It states that a national emergency regarding the disposition of Russian highly enriched uranium has been declared by Executive Order 13617. The emergency was declared due to the risk of nuclear proliferation caused by the accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in Russia. The full implementation of the Agreement Between the United States and Russia Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium is crucial for US national security and foreign policy goals. The notice mentions that assets of the Russian government related to the implementation of the agreement may be subject to legal processes, which could jeopardize the agreement. To protect the payments due to the Russian government, Executive Order 13617 blocks all property and interests in property of the Russian government related to the agreement. The national emergency declared in Executive Order 13617 and the measures adopted to deal with it must continue in effect beyond June 25, 2013, according to the notice. As a result, the national emergency is being continued for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress. The notice is signed by President Barack Obama.
