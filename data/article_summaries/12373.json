President Obama met with representatives from the credit card industry to discuss the impact of the economic crisis on consumers. He called for measures to strengthen consumer protection in the credit card market. The Federal Reserve has taken steps to improve disclosures and end unfair practices, and there are bills in the House and Senate to codify and strengthen these regulations. The President highlighted principles he wants to see in the final legislation, including strong consumer protections, plain language in credit card forms and statements, easy access to contract terms, increased accountability, and penalties for violations of the law. Credit card debt has increased by 25% in the past 10 years, reaching $963 billion in January 2009. More than three-quarters of families have credit cards, and close to half carry a balance. The average credit card debt among families with a balance was $7,300 in 2007. Delinquency rates have increased by over a third since the end of 2006. Credit card issuers collect $15 billion annually in penalty fees, and one-fifth of those carrying credit card debt pay an interest rate above 20%.
