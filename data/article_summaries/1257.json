The Biden-Harris Administration is increasing access to COVID-19 testing in schools to ensure they can remain open for full-time, in-person learning. They plan to provide an additional 10 million tests per month to schools, more than double the volume of testing that occurred in November 2021. The administration believes that vaccinations, boosters, indoor masking, physical distancing, improved ventilation, and screening testing are effective measures to keep students and staff safe in schools. They have already provided significant funding and resources to states and school districts, including $130 billion for school reopening and addressing students' needs, and $10 billion for COVID-19 testing. The administration is also urging school officials to take advantage of available resources to support testing programs.
