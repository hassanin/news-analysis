The leaders discussed the Administration's efforts to promote prosperity, civil rights, and equal representation for the Arab American community. They highlighted key priorities such as representation, immigration, education, anti-discrimination, disability rights, civil rights, foreign policy, and data collection. The officials emphasized the work of the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice to combat hate and discrimination, specifically focusing on Anti-Arab discrimination and Islamophobia. They also discussed the Equitable Data Working Group's report on the need for a Federal data infrastructure that better reflects diversity and addresses inequities. The U.S. Census Bureau's efforts to improve data collection for people of Middle Eastern and North African heritage were also mentioned. The recent tensions in Jerusalem and the West Bank were discussed, with hopes for a peaceful final week of Ramadan. The community leaders and Administration officials agreed to continue working together on these priorities in the future.
