During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre discussed several topics. First, she mentioned that President Biden and First Lady will host a screening of the film "Till," which tells the story of Mamie Till-Mobley, the mother of Emmett Till, who pursued justice after his lynching. The screening will be attended by the cast of the film, Emmett Till's family, civil rights leaders, historians, and families of victims of hate-fueled violence.

Jean-Pierre also mentioned that President Biden had his physical examination that morning, and a comprehensive written report from his doctor will be released later in the day. She did not provide any details about the examination or any potential health issues.

Regarding the recent unidentified aerial objects and the interagency review process, Jean-Pierre stated that President Biden will speak about the United States' response to the objects and China's high-altitude surveillance balloon. She mentioned that the interagency team is continuing to work on parameters for addressing the issue.

When asked about the FBI searching the University of Delaware for President Biden's papers, Jean-Pierre referred the question to the Department of Justice and stated that she cannot comment on ongoing investigations.

Jean-Pierre also addressed comments made by Nikki Haley, who called for mental competency tests for politicians 75 and older. Jean-Pierre did not directly respond to Haley's comments but highlighted President Biden's accomplishments and stated that he has beaten his critics before.

On the topic of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Jean-Pierre expressed the Biden administration's opposition to unilateral measures that undermine the two-state solution and exacerbate tensions. She emphasized that settlements are counterproductive to the cause of peace and reiterated the administration's longstanding position on this issue.

Regarding the debt ceiling, Jean-Pierre stated that the President does not believe in negotiating on this matter and that it is Congress's constitutional duty to address it. She mentioned that the President is open to discussing ways to lower the deficit and fiscal responsibility but does not believe negotiations should be tied to the debt ceiling.

When asked about the train derailment in Ohio and Norfolk Southern's response, Jean-Pierre stated that multiple federal agencies are working on the response and that the health and safety of the community are the top priority. She mentioned that the EPA Administrator is on the ground and that the President has been in regular communication with the governor.

Regarding the recent incident with China's surveillance balloon and the bilateral relationship, Jean-Pierre stated that the administration's approach to China remains calm, resolute, and practical. She emphasized the need for open lines of communication and stated that China's actions were irresponsible.

Jean-Pierre did not provide specific details about the ongoing investigation into the unidentified objects or the President's upcoming trip to Poland.

Finally, Jean-Pierre briefly discussed the President's commitment to workers' rights and support for LGBTQ+ service members. She mentioned that the administration is aware of the challenges faced by veterans unfairly discharged under "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and that efforts are being made to simplify the process of upgrading discharges.
