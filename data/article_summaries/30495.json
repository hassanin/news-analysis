This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Donald J. Trump on January 23, 2017. The memorandum orders a freeze on the hiring of Federal civilian employees across all executive departments and agencies, with the exception of military personnel. No vacant positions existing as of January 22, 2017, can be filled, and no new positions can be created, except in limited circumstances. The heads of executive departments or agencies may exempt positions necessary for national security or public safety. Within 90 days, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will recommend a plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government's workforce through attrition. The memorandum also prohibits contracting outside the government to bypass the hiring freeze. It does not limit the appointment of officials requiring Presidential appointment or Senate confirmation, non-career positions in the Senior Executive Service or Schedule C positions in the Excepted Service, or any other officials who serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority. It also does not limit hiring personnel if it conflicts with applicable law, revoke prior appointments made before January 22, 2017, or abrogate any collective bargaining agreements.
