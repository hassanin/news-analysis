The article discusses a bipartisan group of senators proposing rail safety legislation that aligns with the administration's goals. The legislation aims to hold companies accountable and prevent tragic incidents like the Norfolk Southern derailment in East Palestine. It includes measures such as strengthening safety requirements for trains carrying hazardous materials, phasing in safer tank cars, requiring hotbox detectors every 10 miles, and increasing HAZMAT fees to train first responders. The legislation also seeks to increase fines for safety violations and make companies like Norfolk Southern accountable for long-term damage to communities. The article urges Republicans and Democrats to quickly advance these rail safety measures and send a bill for the president to sign into law.
