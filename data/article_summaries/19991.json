The White House has denied reports that the United States and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks or any meeting after the American elections. The US continues to work with the P5+1 on a diplomatic solution and is prepared to meet with Iran bilaterally. The goal is to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and the US will take necessary actions to achieve that. Sanctions are being used to pressure Iran to comply with its obligations, and if they fail to do so, they will face increased pressure and crippling sanctions.
