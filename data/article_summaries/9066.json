Last week, the White House held a meeting with national health policy and advocacy groups to discuss protecting access to health care, specifically access to abortion. The participants emphasized the potential health care crisis that could arise if Roe v. Wade is overturned and stressed that individuals have the right to make decisions about their own health. They also highlighted the importance of reproductive health care as a matter of health equity and economic security, noting that restrictions disproportionately affect underserved communities. Administration officials expressed the President's strong commitment to reproductive rights and pledged to maintain engagement and partnership with these groups. The meeting included representatives from various organizations.
