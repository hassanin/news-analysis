On July 21, 2023, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Lebanon, which was initially declared on August 1, 2007, by Executive Order 13441. The declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and was aimed at addressing the threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by certain individuals who sought to undermine Lebanon's legitimate government, democratic institutions, and the rule of law. Additionally, ongoing activities such as Iran's arms transfers to Hezbollah were identified as contributing to political and economic instability in the region and as a threat to US national security. Therefore, the national emergency was extended for another year in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
