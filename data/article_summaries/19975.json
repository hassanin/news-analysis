President Obama spoke with Chancellor Merkel about the situation in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists, with support from Moscow, are working to undermine the Ukrainian state. They called for Russia to move its troops back from the border region and discussed the upcoming meeting of the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. foreign ministers and EU High Representative. They praised the Ukrainian government's efforts for reform and emphasized the importance of international financial support for Ukraine. The President stressed the need for the U.S., EU, and other global partners to be prepared for further Russian escalation with additional sanctions. They plan to continue their discussion during Chancellor Merkel's visit to Washington.
