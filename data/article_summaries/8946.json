One year ago, a terrorist attack was launched from Yemen targeting civilian sites in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). While the UAE's air defense systems successfully intercepted the missiles, three innocent civilians lost their lives. The United States remembers the victims and reaffirms its commitment to the safety and security of the Emirati people. The US will continue to support the UAE in defending itself against threats, whether from Yemen or elsewhere. Diplomacy is being pursued to bring a peaceful end to the war in Yemen, and the US will provide military assistance to ensure the security of the UAE and other partners in the Middle East. The US and UAE are also working together to address the climate challenge and advance initiatives like the Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) and the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII). The strong partnership between the two countries is crucial for promoting peace, stability, and integration in the region.
