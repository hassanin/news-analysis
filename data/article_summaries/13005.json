In this press gaggle, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest discusses the situation in Syria and the possibility of increased U.S. involvement. He acknowledges reports of widespread civilian deaths and the use of chemical weapons, which the President finds of grave concern. The President believes that this situation requires attention from the international community and that all options remain on the table when it comes to Syria. However, the President does not envision American boots on the ground and will evaluate the proper course of action based on American national security interests. The Department of Defense is prepared to provide advice to the President, but specific military options are not discussed. The President has asked his team to carefully examine the situation and consult with allies. The President has mentioned a shortened timeline for a decision due to the mass casualty incident and the possible use of chemical weapons. The President's priority is to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and protect allies. The President is committed to working with the international community and has seen some encouraging statements from the Russians and the Syrian opposition regarding cooperation with the UN investigative team. The Assad regime is hindering the investigation and putting itself at odds with the international community. The President wants to build international support to address the situation in Syria. In addition to Syria, Earnest briefly mentions that the list of people on the NSA panel is being worked on, but he does not have a specific date for its release.
