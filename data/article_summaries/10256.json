In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims March 16-22, 2014, as National Poison Prevention Week. He highlights the decline in childhood deaths from accidental poisonings over the past four decades, thanks to improved safety measures and public awareness. However, he also mentions that unintentional poisoning still claims the lives of about 30 American children each year and sends many more to the hospital. The President emphasizes the importance of keeping potentially harmful products out of children's reach and sight in the home. He urges immediate action by calling the Poison Help Line at 1-800-222-1222 if poisoning is suspected. President Obama also encourages Americans to be aware of carbon monoxide dangers and to have heating systems inspected annually and install carbon monoxide alarms. He addresses the issue of prescription drug overdose as the most common cause of fatal poisoning and advocates for proper storage and disposal of medications. The President directs Americans to resources for safe prescription drug disposal and information on preventing accidents and helping poisoning victims. He concludes by calling upon all Americans to observe National Poison Prevention Week by taking actions to protect their families from hazardous household materials and misuse of prescription medicines.
