This article discusses the progress of the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), launched by President Obama in January 2015. The PMI aims to improve health and treat diseases by tailoring treatment and prevention strategies to individuals' unique characteristics. The White House is hosting a Champions of Change event to honor individuals who are driving precision medicine forward. Federal agencies and private-sector groups are making commitments to advance the PMI, including making health data more portable, ensuring patients can access and share their own health information, protecting patient privacy and security, and supporting research platforms connecting researchers and participants. The article also highlights the administration and private-sector commitments launching today, such as developing tools for patients to access their health data, supporting research projects on precision medicine, and launching new capabilities for data registries.
