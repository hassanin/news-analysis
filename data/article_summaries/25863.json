On March 7, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order with the purpose of reducing crime, enhancing public safety, and increasing opportunity in the United States. The order highlights the need to prevent crime and provide individuals who have engaged in criminal activity with opportunities to lead productive lives. It emphasizes the importance of evidence-based rehabilitation programs and reducing recidivism rates. The order establishes the Federal Interagency Council on Crime Prevention and Improving Reentry, which will be co-chaired by the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Senior Advisor to the President in charge of the White House Office of American Innovation. The Council will work with federal, state, local, and tribal officials, as well as other stakeholders, to develop recommendations for evidence-based reforms, improve collaboration, reduce duplication of efforts, and facilitate research in the areas of crime prevention and reentry. The Council will submit an initial report within 90 days and a full report with recommendations within one year. The order revokes a previous Presidential Memorandum from 2016 and will be in effect for three years.
