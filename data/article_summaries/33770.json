The Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence, spoke at the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro in San Diego, California to welcome home the crew after their three-month deployment. Pence commended the Coast Guard for their efforts in combating drug trafficking, particularly in the Eastern Pacific corridor where 80% of cocaine enters the United States. The offload from the Munro's maiden voyage included over 39,000 pounds of cocaine, 933 pounds of marijuana, and the prosecution of 55 alleged smugglers. Pence emphasized the importance of the Coast Guard's work in saving American lives, as drug overdose deaths continue to rise. He also highlighted the connection between drug trafficking and the crisis at the southern border, expressing the administration's commitment to securing the border and ending the crisis. Pence assured the Coast Guard that they have the support of the President and the American people, and that the administration is dedicated to providing the necessary resources for their mission.
