The White House Press Secretary released a statement emphasizing the need for fiscal responsibility. The statement highlights the economic challenges inherited by the current administration and the consequences of failing to pay for new policies in the past. It mentions the transformation of projected surpluses into trillions of dollars in deficits, which could hinder job creation and economic growth. The statement advocates for statutory PAYGO (Pay-As-You-Go), a principle that requires Congress to offset any new spending or tax cuts with revenue increases or spending reductions. It acknowledges that both houses of Congress have incorporated the PAYGO principle into their rules but suggests that enacting it into law would strengthen enforcement and demonstrate a commitment to fiscal discipline. The President is supportive of the Senate's efforts to pass statutory PAYGO as a step towards achieving that goal.
