President Donald Trump recently unveiled a new immigration plan aimed at transforming America's broken immigration system into a source of national unity. The plan consists of two parts: strengthening border security through operational and structural reforms, and implementing a merit-based legal immigration system that protects American wages and prioritizes immediate families. Trump argues that fixing these issues will benefit both citizens and immigrants, as illegal immigration, an unfair entry process, and underfunded law enforcement are harmful to everyone. He also criticizes special interests, such as corporations that exploit cheap, illegal labor, and career politicians who benefit from the status quo. Trump calls for bipartisan support and encourages Democrats to put politics aside and prioritize security and wages. He highlights that America has not reformed its legal admissions system in over 50 years, while other developed countries have modern immigration systems that attract the best talent. Trump emphasizes the need to restore the American Dream for all citizens and newcomers.
