Dr. Cecilia Rouse, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, joined the press briefing to discuss the February jobs report. The report showed that the economy added 678,000 jobs in February, exceeding market expectations. The unemployment rate also decreased to 3.8 percent, and the labor force participation rate increased. Since President Biden took office, the economy has created 7.4 million jobs, including the greatest single year of job growth in American history. The report also showed broad-based growth across industries, with the unemployment rate for workers with less than a high school degree reaching a record low. While the care industry is still lagging behind, there were significant increases in nursing and residential care, childcare, and state and local government employment. The recovery from the pandemic recession has been faster than previous recessions, and measures of long-term unemployment and involuntary part-time work have been decreasing. The administration remains focused on sustainable economic growth and increasing wages through investments in infrastructure, healthcare, childcare, and reducing costs for families. During the briefing, questions were also asked about the impact of rising oil prices, the possibility of a recession, the President's economic plan, and the recent stock market slide.
