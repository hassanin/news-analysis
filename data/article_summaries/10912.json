In this statement, the President expresses his support for financial regulatory reform, stating that it will bring oversight and accountability to the financial system and prevent taxpayers from paying for the mistakes of large banks and financial institutions. He congratulates Chairman Dodd and the Senate Banking Committee for their progress in creating a new consumer agency to enforce clear rules in the financial marketplace. The President pledges to continue fighting to strengthen the bill and prevent attempts to undermine the independence of the agency. He also opposes any loopholes that could harm consumers or investors or allow institutions to avoid critical oversight for financial stability. The President urges Senators to resist pressure from those who want to maintain the status quo and to support long overdue reform that will protect American families and the economy.
