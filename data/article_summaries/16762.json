The White House is pleased with the passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act by the House. This bill aims to improve upon the No Child Left Behind Act by reducing over-testing and federal mandates. It also ensures that all students are held to high academic standards and provides support for students who are falling behind. Additionally, the bill includes funding for high-quality preschool education. The White House is hopeful that the Senate will also pass this bill quickly.
