The article discusses the success of the Affordable Care Act in providing health insurance to Americans. It states that a record-breaking number of Americans have signed up for health insurance through the ACA, with over 16.3 million people enrolling between November 1st and January 15th. This is more than double the number of enrollees during the first Open Enrollment in 2014. In addition, there has been a 50% increase in enrollment in the 30 states that use HealthCare.gov since the current administration took office in January 2021. The article also highlights that four out of five consumers were able to find coverage for as little as $10 a month or less, thanks to lower rates introduced in the American Rescue Plan. These lower rates, which were set to expire at the end of 2022, have been extended through the Inflation Reduction Act, allowing millions of families to save $800 per person per year on their premiums. The article concludes by emphasizing the progress made in expanding coverage and lowering costs, providing affordable health insurance to more Americans.
