The White House has released a presidential determination on refugee admissions for fiscal year 2016. The determination states that up to 85,000 refugees will be admitted to the United States, taking into account humanitarian concerns and national interest. The admission numbers will be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern in different regions, including Africa, East Asia, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America/Caribbean, Near East/South Asia, and an unallocated reserve. The unallocated refugee numbers can be used in regions where additional admissions are needed. Unused admissions allocated to a particular region can be transferred to other regions if there is a greater need. The determination also designates certain groups of people, such as those in Cuba, Eurasia and the Baltics, Iraq, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and persons identified by a U.S. Embassy in any location, as refugees for the purpose of admission to the United States within their countries of nationality or habitual residence. The determination will be published in the Federal Register.
