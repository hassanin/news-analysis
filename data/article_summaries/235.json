On May 12, 2014, President Biden declared a national emergency through Executive Order 13667 in response to the situation in the Central African Republic. The declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat posed by the breakdown of law and order, intersectarian tension, the use of child soldiers, and widespread violence and atrocities. Entities such as the Wagner Group, linked to the Kremlin and Yevgeniy Prigozhin, have been involved in committing these acts. The President has determined that the national emergency still persists and therefore, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, has extended the emergency for another year. This notice has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
