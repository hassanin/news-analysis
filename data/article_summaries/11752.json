President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 of June 26, 2008, expanded in scope in Executive Order 13551 of August 30, 2010, and addressed further in Executive Order 13570 of April 18, 2011, is to continue in effect beyond June 26, 2012. The reason for this continuation is the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, as well as the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea that destabilize the region and pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. President Obama has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency and the measures taken to address these threats.
