This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by Barack Obama in December 2011. The memorandum addresses the global challenge of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals and emphasizes the United States' commitment to promoting human rights. Obama expresses concern over the violence and discrimination faced by LGBT people worldwide, including the criminalization of LGBT status and conduct, physical attacks, and killings based on perceived sexual orientation. The memorandum directs all agencies engaged abroad to ensure that U.S. diplomacy and foreign assistance support and protect the human rights of LGBT individuals. It outlines specific actions to combat the criminalization of LGBT status, protect LGBT refugees and asylum seekers, enhance engagement with foreign governments and civil society, respond to human rights abuses, and engage international organizations in the fight against LGBT discrimination. The memorandum also requires agencies to report on their progress in advancing these initiatives.
