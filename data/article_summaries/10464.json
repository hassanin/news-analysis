Vice President Biden is making a trip to Mexico to discuss the economic relationship between the US and Mexico. The trip is part of a larger effort by the US to engage with Latin America and promote a middle class, secure, and democratic hemisphere. The Vice President will lead the first delegation of the new High-Level Economic Dialogue, which aims to promote competitiveness, foster growth and job creation, sustain innovation, and explore ways to partner for global leadership. The Vice President will also meet with President Pe√±a Nieto to discuss a wide range of issues. The trip was originally planned to include a stop in Panama, but it was postponed due to the situation in Syria. The Vice President will address the recent storms in Mexico and the possibility of providing assistance.
