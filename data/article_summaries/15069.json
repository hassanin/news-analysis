The article discusses the launch of the Cybersecurity Framework by the Obama Administration. This framework is a voluntary guide for organizations in the critical infrastructure community to enhance their cybersecurity. It is a result of a year-long effort led by the private sector and aims to strengthen the security and resilience of critical infrastructure through public-private cooperation. The framework gathers existing global standards and practices to help organizations understand, communicate, and manage their cyber risks. It consists of three components: the Framework Core, Profiles, and Tiers. The Core includes cybersecurity activities grouped into five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The Profiles help organizations align their cybersecurity activities with business requirements, risk tolerances, and resources. The Tiers provide a mechanism for organizations to view their approach and processes for managing cyber risk. While the adoption of the Framework is voluntary, the Department of Homeland Security has established the Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community (C3) Voluntary Program to increase awareness and use of the Framework. This program connects companies and government partners to resources that assist in managing cyber risks. Federal, state, and local governments are evaluating how they can use the Framework to enhance the protection of their systems.
