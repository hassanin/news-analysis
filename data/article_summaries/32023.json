President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Save Our Seas 2.0 Act," which aims to combat marine debris and its negative impact on the US economy, marine environment, and navigation safety. However, Trump has expressed concerns about the constitutionality of certain provisions in the Act. Specifically, he highlights Section 112(b) which grants the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere the authority to appoint and remove members of the Board of Directors of the Marine Debris Foundation, who would be considered inferior officers. According to the Appointments Clause, only the President, the head of a department, or a court of law can appoint inferior officers, and the Under Secretary does not fall into any of these categories. To address this, Trump states that the Under Secretary must make these appointments with the approval of the Secretary of Commerce or by designating already duly appointed officers who have relevant pre-existing duties. Additionally, Trump notes that certain provisions in the Act direct the executive branch's foreign policy and negotiations with foreign governments and international organizations. He asserts that his administration will implement these provisions in line with his constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs.
