President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Delaware, authorizing federal aid to support recovery efforts after severe winter storms and snowstorms that occurred from February 5-11, 2010. The federal funding will be used for emergency work, facility repairs, and replacement in Kent, New Castle, and Sussex Counties. It will also cover emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation measures statewide. Regis Leo Phelan has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made if requested by the state and deemed necessary based on further damage assessments.
