The Obama Administration has released a report called The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment, which highlights the significant threat climate change poses to public health. The report, developed over three years by experts in climate change science and public health, states that as the climate continues to change, the risks to human health will grow, exacerbating existing health threats and creating new challenges. The report provides examples of the increased health risks, such as worsening allergies and asthma conditions due to increased air pollution and allergens, an increase in premature deaths from extreme heat, an earlier onset of Lyme disease cases, and an increase in water-related illnesses. Vulnerable populations, including low-income individuals, communities of color, children, pregnant women, and those with preexisting medical conditions, are most at risk. The report also outlines actions the Administration is taking to respond to these challenges, such as expanding the scope of the President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, developing educational materials on climate change and health for K-12 students, and launching the Climate-Ready Tribes and Territories Initiative. The Administration is also designating May 23-27, 2016, as Extreme Heat Week to enhance community preparedness for extreme heat events.
