President Obama has announced a comprehensive plan to lower veteran unemployment and ensure that servicemembers leave the military career-ready. This plan includes hiring tax credits, private sector commitments, and reforms to improve the way servicemembers are prepared, trained, and educated for civilian jobs. The President has challenged the private sector to hire or train 100,000 unemployed veterans or their spouses by the end of 2013. Several companies, including Microsoft, Siemens, and Walmart, have already made commitments to hire veterans or provide training. The President will also propose returning heroes and wounded warrior tax credits, as well as reforms to ensure that every member of the service receives the training and credentials they need to transition to the civilian workforce. The Department of Labor will establish an initiative to deliver enhanced job search services to transitioning veterans, and the Office of Personnel Management will develop a "Best Practices Manual" for the private sector to help companies identify and hire veterans.
