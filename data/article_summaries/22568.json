President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring September 25, 2010, as National Public Lands Day. This day is meant to celebrate and protect the natural places in America, such as parks, forests, and wildlife refuges. Americans are encouraged to volunteer their time and talents to conserve and restore these public lands. Last year, approximately 150,000 volunteers participated in activities such as removing litter and invasive plants, cleaning water resources, building and maintaining trails, and planting trees and native plants. The President also hosted the White House Conference on America's Great Outdoors to address conservation challenges and opportunities, and to develop a conservation agenda for the 21st century. Through the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, the Administration aims to reconnect Americans to nature and engage in conversations about the conservation of important landscapes and cultural sites. President Obama calls on all Americans to participate in a day of service for public lands and work towards preserving them for future generations.
