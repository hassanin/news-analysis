President Obama visited Hudson Valley Community College to discuss his commitment to fostering new jobs, new businesses, and new industries by promoting innovation. The Obama Innovation Strategy aims to harness the ingenuity of the American people and the private sector to create a more solid and broad-based economy. The strategy consists of three parts: investing in the building blocks of American innovation, promoting competitive markets that spur entrepreneurship, and catalyzing breakthroughs for national priorities. The strategy includes investments in research and development, creating a national environment for entrepreneurship, and government involvement in sectors such as alternative energy, health IT, and advanced vehicle manufacturing.
