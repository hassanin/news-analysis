The article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued on July 21, 2020, regarding the exclusion of illegal aliens from the apportionment base following the 2020 Census. The memorandum states that the Constitution requires the enumeration of the population every 10 years and grants Congress the power to direct the census. The Secretary of Commerce is responsible for conducting the census and transmitting the report of total population to the President, who makes the final determination of the number of Representatives to be apportioned to each state. The Constitution does not specifically define which persons must be included in the apportionment base, but the term "persons in each State" has been interpreted to mean only the "inhabitants" of each state. The discretion to determine who qualifies as an "inhabitant" includes the authority to exclude aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status. The memorandum states that for the purpose of reapportionment following the 2020 Census, it is the policy of the United States to exclude aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status from the apportionment base. This policy is seen as more consonant with the principles of representative democracy and aims to discourage violations of federal law. The memorandum directs the Secretary of Commerce to take appropriate action to provide information to the President to carry out this policy. The memorandum also includes general provisions regarding its implementation and its intent not to create any right or benefit enforceable against the United States or any other party.
