Second Lady Karen Pence and Deputy Secretary of Interior Katharine MacGregor visited the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to discuss the mental health benefits of spending time outdoors. They participated in the reopening of the Clingmans Dome road, which had been closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pence delivered remarks at the Clingmans Dome Visitor Center, highlighting the positive impact of the outdoors on mental health. Research shows that spending time in nature can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Pence and MacGregor also spoke to park employees and praised their efforts to reopen the park safely. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is developing a Park Peer Support Team to assist employees with mental health concerns. The National Park Service is encouraging parks to create Employee Health and Wellness Programs. Pence is the Lead Ambassador for PREVENTS, an interagency task force focused on addressing mental health issues, particularly among veterans. PREVENTS has launched a campaign called "More Than Ever Before" to support people dealing with pandemic-related stress and anxiety.
