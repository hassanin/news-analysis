President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed October 2023 as National Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. In his proclamation, he acknowledges that domestic violence affects every community in the nation, transcending race, religion, and background. He expresses gratitude towards first responders, service providers, and community members who work to ensure the safety and dignity of all Americans. President Biden reflects on his 30-year commitment to ending gender-based violence and highlights the importance of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in shifting the legal and social burdens away from survivors. He emphasizes the improvements made to VAWA over the years, including its expansion to include stalking and sexual assault, access to services for immigrants and communities of color, and protections for LGBTQI+ individuals. President Biden also discusses other legislation he signed, such as gun safety laws and laws supporting domestic violence survivors. He outlines the government's efforts to combat gender-based violence, including the National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence. Despite the progress made, President Biden acknowledges that more needs to be done, as a significant number of Americans still experience sexual abuse, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner. He encourages individuals to seek help through the National Domestic Violence Hotline and emphasizes that survivors are not alone and deserve better. President Biden calls for collective action in changing social norms, supporting survivors, and expressing gratitude to those involved in prevention and response efforts. He envisions a nation free from gender-based violence and urges everyone to work towards that goal.
