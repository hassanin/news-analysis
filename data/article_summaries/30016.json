This article discusses the issue of unaccompanied alien children (UACs) entering the United States and the dangers associated with the current system. The article mentions a tragic incident where two teenage girls were assaulted and killed by members of the MS-13 gang. President Trump argues that loopholes in the law have allowed gang members and other criminals to enter the country as UACs. The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) releases UACs to individuals who claim to be family members or sponsors in the US, but this system is flawed and puts the children at risk. The article also mentions that UACs often fail to appear for immigration court hearings, further exacerbating the immigration court backlog. The Trump Administration has called on Congress to amend the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act to provide better protections for UACs who are genuine victims of trafficking and to allow for the prompt and safe repatriation of those who are not. The article concludes by urging Congress to strengthen immigration laws, fix loopholes, and prioritize public safety.
