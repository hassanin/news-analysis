President Biden's Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy has resulted in the FDA making hearing aids available over the counter without a prescription. This new rule allows adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss to purchase hearing aids at stores or online without the need for a prescription, exam, or audiologist fitting. The FDA estimates that this change could reduce the average cost of hearing aids by up to $3,000 per pair. This development is expected to benefit the nearly 30 million Americans with hearing loss, including almost 10 million adults under the age of 60. Retailers nationwide are now selling over-the-counter hearing aids, providing more options and accessibility for individuals in need.
