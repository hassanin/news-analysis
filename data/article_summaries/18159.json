The White House Office of Media Affairs has announced a conference call to preview President Obama's upcoming visit to Kansas City, Missouri. The call will be held at 1:00 p.m. EDT today and will feature Jared Bernstein, Chief Economist to Vice President Biden, and Matt Rogers, Senior Advisor to Energy Secretary Chu. During his visit to Kansas City on July 8, President Obama will tour Smith Electric Vehicles, an all-electric, zero emissions commercial truck manufacturer. Smith Electric received a $32 million grant from the Recovery Act to build all-electric trucks. This grant is part of the $2.4 billion in Recovery Act advanced battery and electric vehicle grants announced by the President last August. The funds are helping Smith Electric establish operations at a re-purposed jet engine overhaul facility at the Kansas City International Airport. Smith Electric plans to open up to 20 regional assembly plants across the U.S.
