President Barack Obama has proclaimed October 12, 2015, as Columbus Day, in honor of Christopher Columbus's historic voyage over 500 years ago. The proclamation recognizes Columbus's ambitious spirit of exploration and the contributions of Italian-Americans to the United States. However, it also acknowledges the suffering inflicted upon Native Americans during this time and reaffirms the commitment to strengthening tribal sovereignty. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and for the flag of the United States to be displayed on all public buildings.
