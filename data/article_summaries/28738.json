President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency at the southern border of the United States due to the ongoing border security and humanitarian crisis. The southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics. The problem of large-scale unlawful migration has worsened in recent years, with sharp increases in the number of family units entering the country. The inability to provide detention space for these individuals has resulted in many being released into the country and becoming difficult to locate or remove. The Department of Defense has provided support to the Department of Homeland Security, but additional support from the Armed Forces is deemed necessary. The declaration invokes the National Emergencies Act and grants the Secretary of Defense additional authority to use the Armed Forces and invoke construction authority. The Secretary of Defense, along with the Secretaries of the military departments, is directed to order units or members of the Ready Reserve to active duty to assist and support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The proclamation does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States.
