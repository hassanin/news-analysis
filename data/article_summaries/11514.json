Vice President Joe Biden called the Navistar electric truck team to congratulate them on shipping the first electric vehicle produced as a result of the $2.4 billion in Recovery Act advanced battery and electric drive grant awards. The electric truck, powered by an advanced battery manufactured by A123 Systems, is the first of 400 that Navistar plans to build with the help of the Recovery Act funding. President Obama announced the funding last August.
