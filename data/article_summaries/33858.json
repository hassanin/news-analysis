President Donald Trump has vetoed the Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act, stating that it would effectively terminate the West Coast drift gillnet fishery. He argues that the regional fishery management process has had bipartisan support and that forcing the fishery to use alternative gear that has not been proven economically viable would harm small businesses and exacerbate the seafood trade deficit. President Trump also claims that the fishery is subject to robust environmental protections and that eliminating it would increase reliance on imported seafood with higher bycatch levels. He highlights his administration's efforts to support American fishermen and expresses willingness to support provisions of the bill related to the Pacific Halibut fishery if passed separately. However, he opposes the bill as a whole, citing concerns about bypassing the fisheries management process without adequate consultation.
