White House officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, met with Attorneys General Dana Nessel of Michigan and Keith Ellison of Minnesota to discuss efforts in key states to protect reproductive rights. The Vice President emphasized the important role that Attorneys General play in safeguarding the rights of their states' residents and encouraged them to continue defending reproductive rights. Both Attorneys General have taken action to protect access to abortion, with Nessel pledging not to enforce Michigan's outdated abortion ban and Ellison assuring that no one will be prosecuted in Minnesota for seeking or providing a legal abortion. The Administration expressed gratitude for their efforts and committed to working together to protect women's right to make decisions about their own bodies. This meeting follows a previous meeting the Vice President had with seven Attorneys General to discuss reproductive rights.
