According to an important measure of inflation, overall prices in the US went down last month, while incomes increased. This indicates that the American people are experiencing some relief from high prices. The Inflation Reduction Act, which was recently signed, is expected to further bring prices down. Gas prices have also seen a significant decline this summer, the fastest in over a decade. The report also showed an increase in personal income last month. While there is still work to be done to help families living paycheck to paycheck, this report confirms that the economic plan is making progress in building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
