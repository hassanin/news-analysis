The Obama Administration has launched the Build America Investment Initiative to increase investment in infrastructure projects by facilitating partnerships between federal, state, and local governments and private sector investors. The Administration is announcing new steps that federal agencies are taking to bring private sector capital and expertise to improve roads, bridges, and broadband networks. These steps include launching a new Water Finance Center at the Environmental Protection Agency to help address the needs for drinking water and wastewater management, and highlighting the progress of the Rural Opportunity Investment Initiative at the Department of Agriculture to drive investment to rural America. The Administration is also proposing the creation of Qualified Public Infrastructure Bonds (QPIBs) to level the playing field for public-private partnerships. Additionally, the Transportation Investment Center at the Department of Transportation is facilitating private investments in the transportation system. The Administration is also signing a Presidential Memorandum to improve the early phases of infrastructure project planning and design. Lastly, the Administration is promoting investment in U.S. highways and ports through the SelectUSA Investment Summit. These actions and announcements are part of the Build America Investment Initiative's two-year action plan.
