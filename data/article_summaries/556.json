Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany is scheduled to visit the White House tomorrow for a working visit with President Biden. The meeting will focus on the deepening bilateral cooperation between the two countries and the current situation in Ukraine, one year after Russia's invasion. President Biden and Chancellor Scholz have developed a strong partnership over the past year, and this meeting will provide an opportunity for them to assess the progress made in their cooperation. The leaders are expected to discuss Ukraine extensively, as both have recently met with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and have been coordinating on security assistance. While China is not the main focus of the meeting, it may be discussed in the context of Ukraine, as there are concerns about China providing lethal aid to Russia. The leaders will also touch on other global issues, including the upcoming NATO Summit and the challenges posed by China. The meeting is expected to be productive and will likely include a one-on-one component. The details of the meeting, including the location within the White House, are yet to be determined.
