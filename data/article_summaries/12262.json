The White House has released a fact sheet outlining key infrastructure initiatives that support U.S. economic priorities. The fact sheet highlights the importance of infrastructure investment for sustainable and inclusive economic growth. It emphasizes the need for interconnected transportation networks, a reliable electric grid, and well-maintained water infrastructure to efficiently move goods, improve job access, and enhance citizens' quality of life. The fact sheet mentions the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors' recognition of the importance of increasing infrastructure investment to boost demand and lift growth. They outlined a multi-year agenda to promote knowledge-sharing and facilitate infrastructure investment in emerging and developing countries. The agenda includes the creation of the Global Infrastructure Initiative (GII) as a global knowledge platform to disseminate best practices and consolidate information on infrastructure projects worldwide. The fact sheet also highlights support for the World Bank Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF) to improve the investment climate in developing countries and increase resources for infrastructure investment. It encourages the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) to optimize their balance sheets to finance infrastructure in the developing world. Additionally, the fact sheet mentions the APEC Finance Ministers' commitment to advancing infrastructure investment and financing through public-private partnerships (PPP). They endorsed an implementation roadmap to develop successful infrastructure PPP projects in the APEC region and encouraged member economies to set up their own PPP centers. The launch of the APEC PPP Experts Advisory Panel was welcomed as a resource to build capacity and facilitate knowledge sharing among member economies and the private sector.
