The article discusses a proclamation issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the imports of steel articles into the United States. The proclamation establishes a tariff-rate quota on steel articles imported from member countries of the European Union (EU), with steel articles melted and poured in the EU being eligible for in-quota treatment. The United States and the EU have reached an agreement to expand coordination on trade remedies and customs matters, monitor bilateral steel and aluminum trade, and address non-market excess capacity. The proclamation also renews exclusions granted for the import of steel products tariff-free from the EU for two years. The Secretary of Commerce is directed to review and revise the exclusion process, and a process will be established to assist U.S. steel and aluminum consumers in identifying suppliers from trading partners with arrangements under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. The modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) will take effect on January 1, 2022.
