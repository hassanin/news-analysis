In this article, President Joe Biden declares October 2021 as National Youth Substance Use Prevention Month. He acknowledges the devastating impact of addiction and the overdose epidemic on families, with over 93,000 people dying from an overdose in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for resources to address substance use disorder. The administration aims to expand evidence-based prevention programs and access to care and recovery support services. The Drug-Free Communities Support Program helps local communities reduce youth substance use. It is essential for parents, caregivers, educators, and the community to actively promote evidence-based prevention efforts. Delaying substance use until after adolescence decreases the likelihood of developing a substance use disorder. The administration is committed to advancing racial equity in drug policy and supporting tailored tools for prevention efforts in diverse communities. Poverty, homelessness, trauma, and adverse childhood experiences disproportionately impact drug use and the health of youth, especially people of color. By advancing equity in various systems, such as education, healthcare, criminal justice, and housing, a future where all Americans can lead healthy lives can be built. The president emphasizes the disease nature of substance use disorder and vows to expand access to evidence-based prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support services while reducing the supply of illicit drugs. The proclamation calls on various individuals and groups, including communities, parents, caregivers, educators, healthcare professionals, law enforcement officials, faith and community leaders, and all Americans, to take action in promoting evidence-based prevention and improving the health of the nation.
