President Trump has signed four executive orders aimed at reducing prescription drug prices and increasing access to medications such as insulin. These orders are part of ongoing efforts to make medications more affordable and accessible for all Americans. In 2018, prescription drug prices saw the largest annual decrease in over 50 years, and average premiums for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans have fallen by 13.5% since 2017. The executive orders build on this progress. The White House also shared personal stories from Americans who have faced high medical costs and emphasized the importance of lowering medicine prices for all patients.
