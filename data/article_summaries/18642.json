President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation establishing the First State National Monument in Delaware. The monument includes sites related to the settlement of the Delaware region by the Swedes, Finns, Dutch, and English, as well as the role Delaware played in the establishment of the Nation. The monument will be managed by the National Park Service and its partners, who will protect and manage the historic objects and interpret them for the public. The sites within the monument include Fort Christina, New Castle, Dover, and the Brandywine Valley. The proclamation also mentions the preservation of Woodlawn, a property that was donated to the United States by the Conservation Fund. The Secretary of the Interior will be responsible for managing the monument and preparing a management plan within three years. The plan will ensure the preservation and interpretation of the historic objects and the vision of William Poole Bancroft, who established Woodlawn as a rural landscape accessible to the public for their health and well-being. The National Park Service will consult with state and local agencies and other organizations in planning for interpretation and visitor services at the monument. The proclamation also states that existing withdrawals, reservations, and appropriations will not be revoked, but the monument will be the dominant reservation.
