President Barack Obama has established the Reconstruction Era National Monument in South Carolina to commemorate the period between the early Civil War years and the start of Jim Crow racial segregation in the 1890s. This period was a time of significant transformation in the United States as the nation grappled with integrating newly freed African Americans into society. The Reconstruction Era saw the passage of constitutional amendments abolishing slavery, guaranteeing equal protection under the law, and giving all males the right to vote. The monument will preserve and protect historic sites associated with this era, including the Old Beaufort Firehouse, the Penn School, the Brick Baptist Church, and the Camp Saxton site. The National Park Service will manage the monument, and a management plan will be developed within three years. The monument is intended to interpret the objects, resources, and values related to the Reconstruction Era and ensure their preservation for future generations.
