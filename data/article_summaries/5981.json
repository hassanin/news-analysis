The article is a Presidential Determination, specifically Presidential Determination No. 2022-06. It outlines the determination made by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the efforts of foreign governments in combating trafficking in persons. 

According to the determination, the United States will not provide nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance to several governments, including Afghanistan, Burma, China, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, and South Sudan, until they comply with the minimum standards set forth in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 or make significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance. 

Additionally, the United States will not provide nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance to or allow funding for participation in educational and cultural exchange programs by officials or employees of governments such as Cuba, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Eritrea, Nicaragua, Russia, and Syria until they comply with the Act’s minimum standards or make significant efforts to do so. 

The determination also instructs the United States Executive Director of each multilateral development bank and the International Monetary Fund to vote against and deny any loan or utilization of funds for the governments mentioned above until they comply with the Act’s minimum standards or make significant efforts to do so. However, humanitarian assistance, trade-related assistance, and development assistance that directly addresses basic human needs and is not administered by the government of the respective country are exempted from this restriction. 

The determination concludes with provisions for Algeria, Malaysia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela, stating that providing assistance to these countries would promote the purposes of the Act or is otherwise in the national interest of the United States. Partial waivers are also granted for Eritrea and Russia to allow funding for educational and cultural exchange programs, and for Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, and South Sudan to allow certain types of assistance. 

The Secretary of State is directed to submit this determination, along with the required certification and Memorandum of Justification, to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
