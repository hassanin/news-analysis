Vice President Joe Biden wrote an op-ed urging Congress to act now to protect women from domestic violence. He explained that the Violence Against Women Act, which he wrote in 1994, provides law enforcement with tools to prosecute domestic violence crimes, helps victims find safe places to stay, and gives women a crisis hotline for immediate help. While progress has been made, domestic violence still occurs, and improvements are needed. Biden highlighted the importance of new screening tools to reduce domestic violence homicide rates. He shared the tragic story of Sarah Rosio, who was strangled to death by her boyfriend despite seeking a protective order. Biden called on Congress to make the protections in the Violence Against Women Act available to everyone in the country. He expressed disappointment that the House passed a weaker version of the bill compared to the Senate's bipartisan version. Biden emphasized that support for the act is broad and deep, including law enforcement, prosecutors, victims' advocates, faith groups, and members from both parties. He urged Congress to pass the bipartisan version approved by the Senate, as time is running out for victims of domestic violence. Despite political differences, Biden called for leaving politics aside on this issue and prioritizing the safety of women.
