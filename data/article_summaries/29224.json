President Donald J. Trump is calling on Congress to close loopholes in the immigration system that have allowed MS-13 and other criminals to enter the country. He believes that MS-13 is a threat to American communities and is committed to taking strong action against the gang. The current immigration system has loopholes and barriers that make it difficult to effectively combat MS-13.
