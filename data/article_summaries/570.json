Vice President Kamala Harris addressed the issue of medical debt in a teleconference, emphasizing that access to healthcare should be a right for all Americans. Currently, one in three adults, or around 100 million Americans, struggle with unpaid medical bills, with a disproportionate number being Black, Latino, or living in rural areas. This debt often stems from unexpected medical emergencies, causing individuals to accrue tens of thousands of dollars in bills. In addition to the financial burden, medical debt can also harm people's credit scores, limiting their ability to secure loans and investments. To address this issue, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will propose a new rule stating that medical debt cannot impact credit scores and cannot be used to determine credit eligibility. These measures aim to improve the credit scores of millions of Americans and provide them with greater opportunities for financial stability, such as qualifying for loans, owning a home, or starting a small business. The Vice President also highlighted other efforts to lower medical bills and protect consumers, including reducing out-of-pocket healthcare costs, capping the cost of insulin and prescription drugs, and allowing Medicare to negotiate medication prices.
