The White House held an embargoed conference call on June 12, 2009, to discuss new savings in Medicare and Medicaid. The call was attended by OMB Director Peter Orszag and Office of Health Reform Director Nancy-Ann DeParle. The purpose of the call was to provide reporters with information about the new savings proposals that President Obama would announce in his weekly address the following day. The specifics of the proposals were outlined in a letter the President sent to Senators regarding health reform. The call and report were embargoed until 6:00 AM the next day. The conference call was on the record and open for reporters to attend.
