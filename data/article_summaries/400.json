Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman on the US Supreme Court, was a committed and pragmatic advocate for the rule of law and an independent judiciary. She overcame discrimination early in her career and dedicated her life to public service. O'Connor emphasized the importance of civics education and civil discourse, believing that democracy requires listening to one another and finding common ground. In honor of her memory and service, President Biden ordered that the US flag be flown at half-staff at the White House and all public buildings, military posts, naval stations, and naval vessels. This order also applies to US embassies and facilities abroad.
