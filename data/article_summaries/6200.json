The President announced new actions to lower the cost of living for American families and hold big corporations accountable. These steps aim to eliminate unfair fees, known as "junk fees," that burden consumers. The actions include addressing surprise banking overdraft fees, excessive credit card late fees, hidden hotel booking fees, and termination charges for switching cable and Internet plans. The President emphasized that these fees disproportionately affect low-income individuals and people of color. The administration estimates that these actions will save consumers over $1 billion each year. Additionally, efforts are being made to reduce fees in other industries, such as airlines, internet companies, and concert ticket sales. The President highlighted the importance of competition in the economy, stating that capitalism without competition is exploitation. The administration is also working to lower prices and increase competition across various sectors. Overall, the goal is to make the economy work for the middle class and ensure that hardworking Americans have more financial stability.
