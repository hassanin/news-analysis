On July 28, 2011, President Barack Obama issued a notice regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Lebanon. This emergency was initially declared on August 1, 2007, in response to certain persons undermining the sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic processes and institutions. The President determined that these actions pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Ongoing activities, such as arms transfers to Hizballah, were identified as contributing to political and economic instability in Lebanon and undermining its sovereignty. Therefore, the national emergency and related measures blocking the property of certain individuals will continue beyond August 1, 2011, for one year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
