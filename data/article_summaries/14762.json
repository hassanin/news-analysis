President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring March 3, 2014, as Read Across America Day. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of literacy in a child's education and how reading can open doors to opportunity, connect families and friends, and transport us to different worlds. It also pays tribute to Theodor Seuss Geisel, also known as Dr. Seuss, whose books have been instrumental in introducing countless Americans to the joy of reading. The proclamation encourages children, families, educators, librarians, and public officials to celebrate this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that promote reading and engage children in the pastime of reading.
