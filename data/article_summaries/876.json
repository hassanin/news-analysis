President Biden is taking significant steps in response to the military coup in Burma and the unjust detention of President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and other civilian officials, as well as human rights defenders, journalists, and civil society leaders. The United States, together with allies, partners, and international organizations, will stand with the people of Burma as they protest peacefully for democracy. President Biden is implementing concrete actions to hold those responsible for the coup accountable and reaffirm the United States' support for the democratic aspirations of the Burmese people. The actions include imposing new sanctions on military individuals and entities, restricting exports of sensitive goods to the military, and preventing the generals from accessing over $1 billion in Burmese government funds held in the United States. The United States will also work with allies, partners, and like-minded institutions to build international support for the restoration of democracy in Burma. Additionally, U.S. assistance will be redirected to directly support the people of Burma, including healthcare, civil society groups, and vulnerable populations.
