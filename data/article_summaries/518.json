The article is a Presidential Determination, specifically Presidential Determination No. 2022-13. It delegates authority under the Defense Production Act to ensure an adequate supply of infant formula in the United States. The determination is in response to a voluntary recall of several lines of powdered infant formula by Abbott Nutrition, the largest infant formula manufacturer in the country. The recall was initiated due to concerns about bacterial contamination at their facility in Sturgis, Michigan, after four infants fell ill. The recall, combined with supply chain stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to a disruption in the supply of infant formula in the United States. The article emphasizes the importance of an adequate supply of infant formula for the health and safety of children who rely on it for essential nutrition. The Federal Government has taken measures to address the shortfall in infant formula, but additional actions are deemed necessary to protect the well-being of the nation's children. The disruption in the supply chain is seen as a threat to critical infrastructure essential to national defense, public health, and safety. The determination, made under section 101 of the Defense Production Act, states that the ingredients necessary to manufacture infant formula meet the specified criteria. The authority of the President conferred by section 101 of the Act is delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure the continued supply of formula. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and other relevant executive departments and agencies, is authorized to determine the nationwide priorities and allocation of all ingredients necessary for infant formula production, including controlling their distribution in the civilian market. The determination is to be published in the Federal Register.
