The White House has unveiled a proposal called America's College Promise, which aims to make two years of community college tuition-free for responsible students. The goal is to provide students with the opportunity to earn the first half of a bachelor's degree or gain skills needed in the workforce without the burden of debt. The proposal requires community colleges to strengthen their programs and increase graduation rates, states to invest more in higher education, and students to take responsibility for their education and maintain good grades. If all states participate, an estimated 9 million students could benefit from the program. In addition to this proposal, the President is also proposing the American Technical Training Fund, which aims to expand innovative technical training programs and help more Americans secure better-paying jobs. These proposals build upon the President's previous investments in college affordability and quality, such as increasing the maximum Pell Grant award, creating the American Opportunity Tax Credit, and reforming student loans. The President's plan also emphasizes the importance of building high-quality community colleges and ensuring shared responsibility with states. The proposal is inspired by successful programs in Tennessee and Chicago.
