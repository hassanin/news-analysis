National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke with President Maia Sandu of Moldova and expressed appreciation for Moldova's generosity in welcoming individuals fleeing Russian aggression in neighboring Ukraine. He emphasized the US commitment to help Moldova and the region manage the effects of Russia's war, including $100 million in financial assistance to help meet the needs of refugees and additional support to multilateral institutions aiding Moldova. Sullivan also expressed strong support for President Sandu's efforts to build a more democratic and prosperous country. He thanked her for sharing Moldova's experience countering corruption at last year's Summit for Democracy and reiterated US support for reform efforts, including through the European Democratic Resilience Initiative. Both Sullivan and President Sandu welcomed the opportunity to strengthen bilateral cooperation at the upcoming U.S.-Moldova Strategic Dialogue in Washington next week.
