President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for West Virginia in response to severe winter storms and snowstorms that occurred from February 5-11, 2010. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Funding will be available for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and emergency protective measures on a cost-sharing basis. Regis Leo Phelan has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-3272.
