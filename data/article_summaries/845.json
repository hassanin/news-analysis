On General Pulaski Memorial Day, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. honors Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski, a Polish-born hero of the American Revolution who sacrificed his life in defense of establishing a free and independent nation. General Pulaski, known as the "Father of the American Cavalry," is recognized for his leadership and military skills. His service and sacrifice serve as an example of the contributions made by immigrants to build the United States. Polish-Americans, numbering over 9 million, honor General Pulaski's legacy and contributions to democracy. They have played significant roles in defending the country, protecting communities, starting businesses, growing the economy, educating future leaders, and contributing to various fields. In 1929, Congress declared October 11 as General Pulaski Memorial Day, and 80 years later, honorary United States citizenship was granted to him. The memory of General Casimir Pulaski is celebrated nationwide through parks, schools, and landmarks bearing his name. This day commemorates his life and the democratic values for which he bravely gave his life, fostering the enduring bond of friendship between the United States and Poland. President Biden proclaims October 11, 2021, as "General Pulaski Memorial Day" and encourages Americans to honor General Casimir Pulaski and all those who defend the freedom of the nation.
