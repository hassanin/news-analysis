The United States and the European Union (EU) have announced joint efforts to re-establish trade flows in steel and aluminum and address shared challenges in the industry. They plan to negotiate a global arrangement to tackle carbon intensity and global overcapacity. The EU and the US are committed to working together to defend workers, industries, and communities from global overcapacity and climate change. They aim to discourage trade in high-carbon steel and aluminum and ensure domestic policies support reducing carbon intensity. As a sign of trust, the US will not apply section 232 duties and will allow duty-free importation of steel and aluminum from the EU, while the EU will suspend related tariffs on US products. Additionally, a technical working group will be established to share data and develop a common methodology for assessing emissions in traded steel and aluminum. The global arrangement will be open to any country that shares the commitment to reducing trade in carbon-intensive products.
