In this statement, President Obama emphasizes the importance of a free and open internet, stating that it is essential to the American economy and way of life. He asks the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement strong rules to protect net neutrality, based on the almost 4 million public comments received. The President believes that internet service providers (ISPs) should not be allowed to restrict access or pick winners and losers in the online marketplace. He outlines four simple rules for net neutrality: no blocking, no throttling, increased transparency, and no paid prioritization. He also suggests that these rules should be applicable to mobile broadband as well. President Obama proposes that consumer broadband service be reclassified under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, with forbearance from rate regulation and other less relevant provisions, to ensure that ISPs have the same obligations as other vital services. He argues that protecting net neutrality helps foster investment and innovation and asks the FCC to adopt these policies to preserve an open and accessible internet.
