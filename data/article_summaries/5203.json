In Presidential Determination No. 2023-10, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announces the continuation of the exercise of certain authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act with respect to Cuba. These authorities were scheduled to expire on September 14, 2023, but the President determines that their continuation for 1 year is in the national interest of the United States. This determination extends the exercise of these authorities until September 14, 2024, as implemented by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
