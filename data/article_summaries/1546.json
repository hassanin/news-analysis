President Biden will have a phone call with President Putin at the request of the Russian side. The purpose of the call is to discuss upcoming dialogues with Russia on security and strategic issues, including the Strategic Stability Dialogue, NATO-Russia Council, and the OSCE Permanent Council meeting. Both sides will put their concerns on the table and expect a reciprocal discussion. President Biden will emphasize the importance of coordinating closely with allies and partners and the principle of "nothing about them without them." The US has been in intensive consultations with European counterparts and plans to reinforce NATO's force posture in Allied states if there is a further invasion by Russia. The US is prepared for diplomacy but also ready to respond if Russia invades Ukraine. The call will be followed by detailed readouts to allies and partners to coordinate next steps. The reasons behind Putin's request for the call are not known. The US has seen a significant Russian troop presence near the Ukrainian border and expects de-escalation for meaningful progress in the talks. The Ukrainian government has proposed confidence-building measures, and discussions with Russia are ongoing. The US and Russia are likely to discuss the ongoing Iran talks as they have been coordinating closely in Vienna.
