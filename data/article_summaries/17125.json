On June 27, 2013, President Obama released a statement on the Senate's passage of immigration reform. He thanked the Senate leaders and the "Gang of Eight" for their bipartisan efforts. The Senate bill, although a compromise, aligns with the principles of reform that the President has advocated for. It includes a strong border security plan, a pathway to earned citizenship for undocumented individuals, modernization of the legal immigration system, and economic benefits. The President urged the House to follow suit and emphasized the importance of supporters of reform staying vigilant against attempts to derail the bipartisan effort. He called on Americans to reach out to their Members of Congress and advocate for commonsense reform that ensures fairness and tax compliance. The President expressed the unique opportunity to fix the broken immigration system while upholding the nation's traditions as a nation of laws and immigrants, and called on Congress to complete the task.
