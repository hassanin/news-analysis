President Obama has issued a Presidential Memorandum on promoting diversity and inclusion in the national security workforce. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion in addressing the complex and global nature of national security challenges. It acknowledges that the national security workforce is less diverse compared to the wider federal government and outlines actions to leverage the diversity of the workforce. These actions include collecting and analyzing workforce data, providing professional development opportunities, and strengthening leadership engagement and accountability. The memorandum aligns with previous initiatives and legislative efforts to promote diversity in the national security workforce.
