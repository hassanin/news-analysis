President Biden has declared a major disaster for the Burns Paiute Tribe due to severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred in June 2023. Federal aid will be provided to supplement the Tribe's efforts in the affected areas. The Burns Paiute Tribe and certain nonprofit organizations can receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and repairs. Hazard mitigation measures are also eligible for federal funding. Toney L. Raines from FEMA will coordinate federal recovery operations. Additional designations may be made if requested by the Tribe and based on further damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA news desk.
