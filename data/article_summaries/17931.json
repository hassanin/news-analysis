The President signed three bills into law on May 16, 2016. 

The first bill, S. 32, is called the "Transnational Drug Trafficking Act of 2015." It makes it illegal for individuals to manufacture or distribute certain controlled substances or chemicals if they intend, know, or have reasonable cause to believe that these substances or chemicals will be imported into the United States unlawfully. 

The second bill, S. 125, is the "Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2015." It reauthorizes the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program until FY 2020. The bill also requires grant applicants to provide bulletproof vests specifically fitted for officers, including female officers, in order to receive preferential consideration. 

The third bill, S. 2755, is the "Fallen Heroes Flag Act of 2016." This bill allows Members of Congress to provide Capitol-flown flags to the families of firefighters, law enforcement officers, members of a rescue squad or ambulance crew, or public safety officers who died in the line of duty.
