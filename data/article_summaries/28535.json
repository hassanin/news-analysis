The Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), Jim Carroll, has called on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to implement governance reforms to protect athletes, increase transparency, and restore confidence in clean competition. These reforms were initially called for at a White House summit in October 2018. Carroll expressed satisfaction that WADA has taken initial steps to improve its governance structure and hopes to see the agency operate in a more accountable, democratic, and athlete-centered manner in the future. Carroll also congratulated Witold Banka, Poland's Minister of Sport and Tourism, on his nomination as WADA President and expressed support for Banka's efforts to strengthen WADA and restore its credibility. Additionally, Carroll supports the establishment of a working group to examine the allocation of global financial contributions to fund WADA. The current funding formula, established twenty years ago, needs to be re-examined to ensure more equitable distribution across regions and nations. These calls for reform were made in response to a global summit hosted by the White House, which brought together WADA representatives, government officials, anti-doping leaders, and members of the global athletic community to discuss the need for reforms and improvements within WADA.
