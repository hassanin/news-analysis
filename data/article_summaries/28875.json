President Donald J. Trump has signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum to establish a National Vetting Center (NVC), which will be led by the Department of Homeland Security. The purpose of the NVC is to coordinate the efforts of departments and agencies to better identify individuals seeking to enter the country who pose a threat to national security, border security, homeland security, or public safety. The current vetting efforts of the Federal Government are ad hoc, hindering our ability to address today's threats. The NVC will centralize these activities, allowing officials to better utilize intelligence and law enforcement information to identify terrorists, criminals, and other nefarious individuals trying to enter and remain within the country. The NVC's operations will respect individuals' privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties, while prioritizing the safety and security of the public.
