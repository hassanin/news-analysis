New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) shows that there were 7.4 million job openings in April, indicating a strong job market. This data also reveals that there are more job openings than unemployed workers in 44 states and the District of Columbia. In many of these states, the number of available job openings far exceeds the number of unemployed workers. This information can be used to target policies aimed at encouraging job training and getting more workers into the workforce. The data also suggests that the strong economy is benefiting workers across the United States.
