President Obama has issued a memorandum directing departments and agencies to identify high impact infrastructure projects that can be expedited through review and permitting processes. Each department will select up to three projects that will create jobs, have necessary funding, and can be completed within 18 months. The President also directed the creation of a Projects Dashboard to provide transparency and facilitate public input. The announcement is focused on high-priority projects, but agencies are also encouraged to use information technology tools to improve efficiency in permitting and review processes. This initiative was recommended by the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. Various agencies have already taken steps to improve review and permitting processes, such as streamlining environmental review, speeding up highway project delivery, breaking down policy barriers for sustainable development, and making air and water permitting leaner.
