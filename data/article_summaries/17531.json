The United States and the Russian Federation have signed a new bilateral framework on threat reduction. This framework builds upon the success of the 1992 Agreement between the two countries on the safe transportation, storage, and destruction of weapons and the prevention of weapons proliferation. The new framework authorizes collaboration in areas such as protecting, controlling, and accounting for nuclear materials. The signing of this framework demonstrates the commitment of both countries to nuclear security and nonproliferation objectives.
