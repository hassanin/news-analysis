The United States is deeply concerned about the crisis in northern Rakhine State in Burma, where over 300,000 people have been displaced following attacks on Burmese security posts. The displacement and victimization of people, particularly the Rohingya community, indicate that the Burmese security forces are failing to protect civilians. The US condemns the alleged human rights abuses, including killings, village burnings, massacres, and rape, committed by both security forces and civilians with their consent. The US calls on Burmese security authorities to respect the rule of law, stop the violence, and end the displacement of civilians from all communities. The US also urges the Burmese security forces to collaborate with the elected government in implementing the recommendations of the Rakhine Commission. The US welcomes the Burmese government's commitment to providing humanitarian assistance to the victims and urges them to grant media access to the affected areas. Most of the displaced people have sought refuge in Bangladesh, and the US appreciates the efforts of the Bangladeshi government in facilitating humanitarian aid.
