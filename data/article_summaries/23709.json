President Obama visited the Boeing assembly facility in Everett, Washington to announce new steps aimed at promoting American manufacturing and increasing U.S. exports. The President's goal is to double U.S. exports over five years, and he is on track to meet that goal. Today's announcement includes measures to provide export financing to American manufacturers, support small business exporters, and expand the responsibilities of the Export Promotion Cabinet. The President also highlighted the positive signs in American manufacturing, with the sector adding more than 400,000 jobs in the past two years. The Administration has been working to open up markets for American goods and level the playing field for American companies through trade agreements and efforts at the Export-Import Bank. The Bank has supported export sales of Boeing aircraft and has set export financing records for the past three years. The President announced several new initiatives, including financing to put American companies on an even footing with foreign competitors, new credit for small business exporters, a call to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, a simplified process for foreign trade zones, legislation to make it easier for businesses to export, and the launch of BusinessUSA, a virtual one-stop shop for businesses to access government services and information.
