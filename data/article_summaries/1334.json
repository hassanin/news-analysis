President Biden has vetoed H.J. Res. 45, a resolution that aimed to disapprove of the Department of Education's rule on "Waivers and Modifications of Federal Student Loans." The President's administration has been focused on making college more affordable and improving the student loan system. They have increased Pell Grants and plan to double the maximum grant by 2029. The Department of Education has also proposed a repayment plan that would cut undergraduate loan payments in half and reformed the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Additionally, the Department of Education created a program to provide debt relief to individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The relief program received significant demand, with 26 million people applying for relief within four weeks. The President believes that the Department of Education's actions are based on authority granted by Congress and have been used by multiple administrations in the past. He views the attempts to deny relief to millions of borrowers as a disservice to working families. President Biden remains committed to making college affordable and providing relief to borrowers recovering from the pandemic.
