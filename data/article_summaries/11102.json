President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of West Virginia, authorizing federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following Hurricane Sandy. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Barbour, Boone, Braxton, Clay, Fayette, Kanawha, Lewis, Nicholas, Pendleton, Pocahontas, Preston, Raleigh, Randolph, Taylor, Tucker, Upshur, Webster, and Wyoming are eligible for this assistance. In addition, federal funding is also available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Dolph A. Diemont has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Further designations for assistance may be made in the future based on damage assessments.
