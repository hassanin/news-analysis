They also took steps to reinforce the global norm against nuclear explosive testing.

Overall, the article highlights the Obama administration's commitment to seeking a world without nuclear weapons and the progress made in areas such as nuclear security, non-proliferation, peaceful use of nuclear energy, and reduction of nuclear weapons.
