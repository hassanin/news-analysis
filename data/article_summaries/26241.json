In a press briefing, President Trump announced that the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Florida, has been canceled due to concerns about the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in the state. He stated that the timing for the event is not right and that the safety of the American people is his top priority. The convention will still take place in North Carolina, but in a smaller form with delegates gathering to do the nomination. Trump also provided an update on efforts to reopen schools safely, emphasizing the importance of in-person learning and the need to protect the health and well-being of students and teachers. He stated that children are at lower risk from the virus and that many European countries and others have successfully reopened their schools without significant increases in cases. Trump called on Congress to provide $105 billion in funding to support school reopening efforts and mentioned the possibility of directing some of that money towards testing for school districts. He also discussed the need to continue supporting states and cities in the current hotspots and highlighted the efforts being made to increase testing and provide necessary supplies. Trump mentioned that he spoke with President Putin of Russia and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia about the challenges they are facing with COVID-19. He expressed his desire for a payroll tax cut but acknowledged that Democrats are unlikely to support it. He also mentioned the need for a new FBI building and his support for building a new facility rather than renovating the existing one.
