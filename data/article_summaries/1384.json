President Biden has announced bold steps to increase COVID-19 vaccine supply in the United States. The administration plans to increase the weekly vaccine supply to states, tribes, and territories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses. This will allow millions more Americans to be vaccinated sooner. The administration will also provide states with a reliable three-week supply look-ahead, giving them greater certainty to plan their vaccination efforts effectively. Additionally, President Biden has directed his COVID-19 Response Coordinator to purchase an additional 100 million doses of each of the FDA-authorized vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. This will double the nation's vaccine supply, increasing the total order from 400 million to 600 million doses. These additional doses are expected to be delivered this summer, allowing for the full vaccination of 300 million Americans by the end of summer.
