President Donald Trump has signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 into law. While he appreciates the Congress passing the bill, he has raised concerns about certain provisions that he believes raise constitutional concerns. These provisions restrict the President's authority to control military personnel and materiel, require advance notice to Congress before certain military actions, restrict transfers of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, and interfere with the operation of the Executive Office of the President. Trump also objects to provisions that dictate the position of the United States in external military and foreign affairs and limit certain expenditures. He plans to treat these provisions consistent with his exclusive constitutional authorities as Commander in Chief and as the sole representative of the nation in foreign affairs. Trump also notes constitutional concerns related to the appointment of the Chief Management Officer and the tenure protections for the Special Counsel. Furthermore, he asserts his authority to withhold information protected by executive privilege and his discretion to recommend legislative measures to Congress.
