Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics Daleep Singh, along with other U.S. officials, led a delegation to Ghana and Senegal to discuss infrastructure needs in these countries and the wider region. The visit was part of the Biden Administration's Build Back Better World Initiative (B3W) to address infrastructure gaps exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Ghana, the delegation met with Vice President E. Mahamudu Bawumia and Ministers of Finance, Defense, and National Security. In Senegal, they met with President Macky Sall and the Minister of Economy to discuss investment mobilization and improving development impact. The delegation also visited a vaccination manufacturing facility and engaged with international financial institutions and civil society representatives. The United States recognizes the importance of partnerships in implementing the B3W initiative and addressing infrastructure needs in developing countries. Recently, President Biden, along with other G7 leaders, met with countries with significant infrastructure needs to discuss climate crisis and infrastructure development. Earlier in October, Singh led a delegation to Latin American countries to gather input from stakeholders.
