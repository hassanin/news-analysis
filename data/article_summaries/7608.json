The United States strongly condemns the attack on the MV Pacific Zircon, a commercial tanker, which occurred on November 15 in international waters off the coast of Oman. After reviewing the available information, it is believed that Iran likely conducted the attack using a UAV, a lethal capability it has been increasingly using in the Middle East and sharing with Russia. This attack is part of a pattern of destabilizing activities by Iran and poses a threat to freedom of navigation, international shipping, and the lives of those involved. The United States, along with its allies, will work together to hold Iran accountable and respond appropriately to this attack. The British Royal Navy was the first to respond to the incident, and the United States appreciates the multilateral coordination led by the UK. President Biden has emphasized the commitment to supporting the free flow of commerce through vital waterways in the Middle East region.
