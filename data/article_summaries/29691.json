The Trump Administration has released a National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan to reduce the risk of asteroid impacts on Earth. The plan outlines five strategic goals to increase national preparedness, leveraging existing policies and capabilities. Scientists and engineers at NASA and across the country are working to advance scientific and technological understanding to keep Americans safe. The probability of a devastating asteroid collision in this century is extremely low, but the US has been proactively preparing for this threat by developing telescopes and other technologies to detect potentially hazardous asteroids and comets. This plan aims to improve America's capacity and readiness to warn against, prepare for, and prevent damaging asteroid impacts.
