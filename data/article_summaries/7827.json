In a teleconference, Bob Fenton, the White House Monkeypox Response Coordinator, provided an update on the Biden administration's response to the monkeypox outbreak. Some key announcements included:

1. FDA and CDC have allowed the JYNNEOS vaccine to be administered intradermally, increasing the number of doses in each vial by up to fivefold. This has significantly increased the vaccine supply without compromising safety or effectiveness.

2. The Biden administration has delivered nearly 1 million doses of vaccines to states and cities, with plans to continue scaling up supply.

3. A pilot program will provide up to 50,000 doses of vaccines from the national stockpile for large LGBT events, such as Pride, to support vaccination efforts among gay and bisexual men.

4. HHS will pre-position 50,000 courses of the antiviral drug TPOXX across the country, ensuring quick access to treatment for monkeypox cases.

The administration is focused on increasing access to vaccines, turning doses into vaccinations, and mitigating the spread of monkeypox through targeted strategies and community engagement. They are working closely with state and local health departments, as well as partnering with manufacturers to meet demand and expand capacity. The intradermal dosing strategy is being implemented, and efforts are being made to provide clear and consistent messaging to the public.
