The United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that former National Security Adviser John Bolton likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his nondisclosure agreement. The court criticized Bolton for considering the review process for his book as "intolerable" and stated that he gambled with national security for personal profits. Although the court denied the government's request for an injunction, Bolton may still face consequences such as losing profits from the book deal and potential criminal liability. The government intends to hold Bolton accountable for his actions and ensure that he does not receive any profits from his decision to prioritize money and attention over national security.
