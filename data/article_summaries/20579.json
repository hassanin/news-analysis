The article provides key facts about the New START Treaty. The treaty is organized into three tiers: the Treaty text, a Protocol containing additional rights and obligations, and Technical Annexes to the Protocol. All three tiers will be legally binding. The Treaty limits the number of strategic arms for the US and Russia within seven years of its entry into force. The limits are based on a Department of Defense analysis and include a limit of 1,550 warheads and a combined limit of 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. The Treaty also includes a verification regime that combines elements from the 1991 START Treaty with new tailored elements. The duration of the Treaty is ten years, with the possibility of extension for up to five years. The Treaty does not impose any constraints on US missile defense programs or long-range conventional strike capabilities. The approval of the US Senate and the Russian legislature is required for the Treaty to enter into force.
