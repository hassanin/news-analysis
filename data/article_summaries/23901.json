President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Alabama and ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding occurred from April 28, 2014, onwards. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in Baldwin, Jefferson, Lee, and Limestone Counties. This assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to support individuals and business owners in recovering from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency work, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis for state and eligible local governments, certain private nonprofit organizations, and statewide efforts. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has designated Albert Lewis as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage surveys are ongoing in other areas, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated after assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
