The article discusses a Presidential Study Directive issued by President Barack Obama in 2011, which calls for the creation of an Interagency Atrocities Prevention Board. The directive states that preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and moral responsibility of the United States. It highlights the need for a comprehensive policy framework and interagency mechanism to prevent and respond to mass atrocities. The Atrocities Prevention Board will coordinate a whole-of-government approach to atrocity prevention, ensuring early indicators are recognized, comprehensive strategies are developed, and capacities are increased. The directive also calls for an interagency review to develop the structure and operational protocols of the board, as well as identify how the Intelligence Community and other agencies can support its mission. The review will also explore steps towards creating a comprehensive policy framework for preventing mass atrocities. The interagency review is expected to be completed within 100 days, and the Atrocities Prevention Board will begin its work within 120 days.
