This article discusses the executive orders issued by President Donald Trump on July 3, 2020, regarding the preservation and creation of monuments to honor American history. The purpose of the executive orders is to protect and preserve monuments that have been vandalized or destroyed during recent protests. The orders establish a task force called the Interagency Task Force for Building and Rebuilding Monuments to American Heroes, which will be chaired by the Secretary of the Interior. The task force will propose options for the creation of a National Garden of American Heroes, which will be a statuary park honoring historically significant Americans. The park will include statues of figures such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., and Harriet Tubman. The task force will also prioritize the commissioning of new statues and works of art that depict historically significant Americans or events. The executive orders also emphasize the importance of educating Americans about the founding documents and ideals of the United States. The Attorney General will enforce the protection of the National Garden and the statues commissioned under these orders. The orders define "historically significant Americans" as individuals who made substantive contributions to America's public life or had a substantive effect on America's history, including figures like Christopher Columbus and Junipero Serra. The orders state that they are subject to applicable law and appropriations and do not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
