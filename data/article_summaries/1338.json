In a speech from the East Room, President Biden addressed the issue of prescription drug prices in the United States. He highlighted the excessive cost of prescription drugs in America compared to other developed nations, citing examples of price increases for drugs such as insulin. The President emphasized the need to lower drug prices to alleviate the financial burden on American families.

President Biden outlined several steps his administration has taken to address the issue, including improving competition in the market and allowing the safe importation of prescription drugs from Canada. He also called on Congress to take action, specifically urging them to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and cap the amount seniors have to spend on prescription drugs each year.

The President's plan aims to reduce drug prices for all Americans, not just seniors, and expands Medicare to include dental, vision, and hearing coverage. The savings generated from lower drug prices would be used to reduce premiums and improve access to healthcare for those covered under Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.

President Biden also criticized pharmaceutical companies for prioritizing stock buybacks and dividends over research and development. He proposed the creation of an Advanced Research Project Agency within the National Institute of Health to accelerate cutting-edge research on diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer.

The President concluded by urging Americans to support these reforms and emphasized the bipartisan nature of the issue, stating that healthcare should be a right, not a privilege. He called on Congress to come together and make a difference in people's lives by addressing the high cost of prescription drugs.
