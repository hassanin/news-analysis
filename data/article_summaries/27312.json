On March 6, 2003, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency and blocked the property of certain individuals in Zimbabwe, citing their actions and policies as a threat to the foreign policy of the United States. This was done under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Additional steps were taken in 2005 and 2008 to further address the national emergency. The President has now decided to continue the national emergency for another year, as the actions and policies of these individuals still pose a threat to US foreign policy. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
