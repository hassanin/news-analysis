On May 15, 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order establishing the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force. The task force is responsible for monitoring the enforcement of the prohibition on forced labor under section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The task force will be chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security and will include representatives from the Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Other executive departments or agencies may also be invited to participate. The task force will make decisions on actions related to forced labor by consensus, but if consensus cannot be reached, decisions will be made by majority vote. Each department or agency represented on the task force will be responsible for their own expenses. The executive order also clarifies that it does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies, or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and it does not create any rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities.
