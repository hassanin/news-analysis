The African Union and the United States have announced a strategic partnership to address food security in Africa. The partnership will reference and build upon existing efforts to advance food security, leveraging both public and private sectors. The immediate focus will be on addressing disrupted food supplies and fertilizer needs, while also promoting long-term investments in sustainable and resilient food systems. Concrete progress on short-term goals will be made, with a plan of action for longer-term goals to be developed by February 2023. The global pandemic, climate crisis, high energy and fertilizer prices, and conflicts have highlighted the need for increased investments to tackle the root causes of the food crisis in Africa. Strengthening food security will enhance African countries' ability to trade and connect to agricultural markets, while also providing employment opportunities. The continent's vast untapped potential in arable farmland is seen as crucial in addressing global food insecurity. The strategic partnership aims to utilize diplomatic, multilateral, technical, and financial tools to build stronger and diversified food systems, scale agricultural production capacity, and invest in more resilient agricultural sectors. The partnership reaffirms commitments to existing programs and initiatives focused on African agriculture and food security. Efforts related to climate adaptation, soil health, fertility, and improved agricultural inputs will also be intensified. The partnership will address both short-term and long-term priorities, with the United States leveraging its convening power to bring together the private sector and international financial institutions, while the African Union will commit to removing obstacles that impede agriculture-centered investments.
