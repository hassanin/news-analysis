Vice President Kamala Harris has announced new actions to support historically under-resourced suppliers, small businesses, and communities as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's Investing in America agenda. The agenda aims to build the economy from the bottom up and middle out, creating economic opportunity and prosperity for millions of Americans. The construction of manufacturing facilities has contributed significantly to the economy, and diversification of suppliers is crucial for resilience and equitable sharing of economic benefits. The administration has awarded a record-breaking $70 billion in federal contracts to small, disadvantaged businesses and invested $12 billion in community lenders to expand access to capital. These investments are expected to result in increased lending to Latino and Black communities over the next decade. The Small Business Administration has also increased lending to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses, leading to a rise in new businesses started by Black and Latino entrepreneurs and lower unemployment rates for these communities. The announcements coincide with the annual Freedman's Bank Forum and involve commitments from the private, public, and non-profit sectors to accelerate wealth-building for underserved businesses and communities.
