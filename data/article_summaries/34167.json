This article is a proclamation issued by President Donald Trump on August 28, 2020, regarding the adjustment of imports of steel articles into the United States. The proclamation refers to previous proclamations made in 2018, which imposed a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on steel articles imported from most countries due to their potential threat to national security. However, the Secretary of Commerce has advised the President that significant changes have occurred in the US steel market, including a contraction in 2020 and a decrease in steel shipments. Brazil is highlighted as the second largest source of steel imports to the US. As a result of discussions between the US and Brazil, the President has decided to lower a quantitative limitation on certain steel article imports from Brazil for the remainder of 2020 to address the threat to national security caused by these imports. The President also directs the Secretary to provide relief from the quantitative limitation in specific circumstances to avoid disruptions in production activities in the US. The proclamation outlines the criteria and procedures for granting relief. The modifications and provisions outlined in the proclamation will take effect from August 28, 2020.
