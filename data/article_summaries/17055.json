President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation to enlarge the boundary of the California Coastal National Monument. The proclamation adds six additional areas along the California Coast to the monument, including Trinidad Head, Waluplh-Lighthouse Ranch, Lost Coast Headlands, Cotoni-Coast Dairies, Piedras Blancas, and Orange County Rocks and Islands. These areas contain significant scientific or historic resources and provide vital habitat for wildlife. The proclamation aims to protect and preserve these objects of historic or scientific interest for the benefit of all Americans. The management of the monument will be carried out by the Bureau of Land Management, and access to certain areas will be permitted once a management plan is completed. The proclamation also ensures the protection of Indian sacred sites and traditional cultural properties and maintains existing rights and jurisdiction of the State of California and the United States.
