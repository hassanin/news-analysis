The G-20 has implemented significant financial regulatory reforms since the global financial crisis, strengthening the resilience of financial systems, expanding regulation, and transforming the global financial landscape. The United States has played a leading role in raising the quality of regulation and leveling the playing field across major financial centers. The G-20 has achieved progress in areas such as strengthening bank capital and liquidity, reducing risks posed by large financial institutions, and making derivatives markets more transparent and safer. The United States has also launched initiatives to establish global margin standards on non-centrally cleared derivatives and to identify parties to financial transactions. The focus now is on implementing these reforms while reducing risks to economic recovery and ensuring a level playing field globally.
