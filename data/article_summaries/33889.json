In a Presidential Memorandum issued on September 25, 2020, the President has withdrawn certain areas of the United States Outer Continental Shelf from leasing disposition for a period of 10 years, starting from July 1, 2022, and ending on June 30, 2032. The specific area affected is the portion of the Mid Atlantic Planning Area that lies south of the northern administrative boundary of North Carolina. This withdrawal prevents any consideration of this area for leasing purposes related to exploration, development, or production during the specified 10-year period. However, the withdrawal does not apply to leasing for environmental conservation purposes such as shore protection, beach nourishment and restoration, wetlands restoration, and habitat protection. Existing leases in the withdrawn area are not affected by this memorandum. It is important to note that this memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
