The article is a Presidential Memorandum from September 12, 2011, announcing the submission of the "American Jobs Act of 2011" to Congress. The memorandum emphasizes the need to rebuild the economy based on balance, fairness, and the same set of rules for everyone. The proposed legislation aims to create jobs and put more money in the pockets of working Americans without adding to the deficit. It includes tax cuts for small businesses and workers, as well as provisions to put more people back to work, extend unemployment benefits, and reform the system with training programs. The legislation is fully paid for through closing corporate tax loopholes and asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share. The President urges prompt and favorable consideration of the proposal.
