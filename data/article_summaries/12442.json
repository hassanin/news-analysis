The White House will be hosting its annual Spring Garden Tours on April 18th and 19th, 2009. Visitors will have the opportunity to view various gardens and grounds including the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, the Rose Garden, the Children's Garden, and the South Lawn. A new addition to the South Lawn, the White House Kitchen Garden, will also be visible from a distance. Tickets are required for all attendees, including children, and will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis at the Ellipse Visitor Pavilion. The tours are open to the public, but tours of the Residence will be closed on those dates. Certain items are prohibited on the White House grounds, such as food and beverages, duffel bags/suitcases/backpacks, animals (except guide dogs), aerosols, knives, mace, smoking, fireworks, and weapons. Strollers, wheelchairs, and cameras are permitted. In case of bad weather, the Garden Tours will be cancelled.
