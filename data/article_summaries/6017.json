The Biden Administration has launched COVID.gov, a new website that serves as a one-stop shop for people in the United States to access important COVID-19 tools such as vaccines, tests, treatments, and masks. The website also provides the latest updates on COVID-19 in their area. The Administration has set up over 90,000 vaccination sites, distributed over 400 million masks for free, and sent free tests to people's homes. They have also established test-to-treat sites where people can get tested and receive antiviral treatments all in one place. The Test-to-Treat locator tool on COVID.gov helps people find pharmacies and community health centers where they can get tested for COVID-19 and receive appropriate treatments if needed. The Administration has already launched over 2,000 of these sites across the nation, with a focus on hard-hit and high-risk communities. The President has released a National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan and is urging Congress to provide $22.5 billion in immediate emergency funds to support the COVID-19 response. The website COVID.gov is available in English, Spanish, and Simplified Chinese and can be accessed through the National Hotline, which supports over 150 languages. The Administration is also making these tools available to individuals with disabilities through the Disability Information and Access Line.
