Vice President Kamala Harris and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are leading a Day of Action event to encourage Americans to sign up for the Expanded Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit. The event involves hundreds of non-profit organizations, state and local governments, members of Congress, and federal agencies. The aim is to ensure that every eligible American receives the tax relief they are entitled to under current law. The event coincides with the launch of the revamped ChildTaxCredit.gov website, which provides tools and resources to help taxpayers file their taxes and access the tax credits. Congressional champions, including Senators Michael Bennet, Sherrod Brown, Cory Booker, and Reverend Raphael Warnock, and Representatives Rosa DeLauro and Suzan DelBene, are also participating in the event. Additionally, hundreds of non-profits, community-based organizations, and various other groups are taking action to reach families across the country. State, local, municipal, and tribal leaders are committing to actions throughout the tax filing season to promote enrollment in the tax credits. The federal government and philanthropic organizations are also supporting efforts to increase access to tax benefits. The American Rescue Plan expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit to include more people and families, and increased the credit for workers without dependent children.
