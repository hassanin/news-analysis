During a press briefing aboard Air Force One en route to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan outlined President Biden's agenda for the U.S.-ASEAN Summit and the East Asia Summit. Sullivan highlighted the President's commitment to elevating U.S. engagement in the Indo-Pacific region and building on previous accomplishments, such as the elevation of the U.S.-ASEAN partnership to a comprehensive strategic partnership. The President will focus on maritime domain awareness, defense cooperation, freedom of navigation, and the need for peace and stability in the region. Sullivan also mentioned that the President will discuss North Korea's missile and nuclear programs with his Japanese and Korean counterparts, as well as with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Additionally, the President will address the situation in Myanmar and coordinate efforts to put pressure on the junta. Sullivan did not provide specific details on climate commitments that the President will seek from President Xi, but he emphasized the importance of leader-to-leader engagement in resolving issues. The briefing also touched on the recent Russian pull-out in the Kherson region of Ukraine, student loan relief, layoffs at Twitter, and the President's calls to politicians following the November elections.
