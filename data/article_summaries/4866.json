In this article, President Joe Biden issues an executive order outlining his administration's environmental policy and priorities. The order emphasizes the importance of listening to science, improving public health, protecting the environment, and addressing climate change. It directs all executive departments and agencies to review and potentially revise regulations and actions taken during the previous four years that conflict with these objectives. The order also calls for the restoration of national monuments and revokes permits for the Keystone XL pipeline. Additionally, it establishes an Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases to accurately assess the costs of greenhouse gas emissions.
