Vice President Joe Biden wrote an op-ed in The Financial Times congratulating Croatia on becoming the 28th member of the EU. He praises the courage of the Croatian people and leaders for overcoming ultranationalism and resentment, and building democratic institutions. Biden believes that Croatia's success is a testament to the transformative power of the European project, which guides countries towards the rule of law, open markets, prosperity, and peace. He also emphasizes the importance of Croatia's neighbors making the right choices to pave their own paths into Europe. Biden mentions Serbia and Kosovo's historic agreement to normalize relations, Montenegro and Albania's progress towards European integration, and Macedonia's need to address interethnic tensions. He expresses disappointment in Bosnia-Herzegovina for not taking the necessary steps to become part of Europe. Biden concludes by reaffirming the goal of welcoming the entire Balkans into a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace.
