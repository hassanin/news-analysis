On May 8, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring the continuation of a national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. This national emergency was initially declared on May 11, 2004, and has been modified and relied upon for additional steps taken in subsequent executive orders. The President took these actions due to the threat posed by the Syrian government's support for terrorism, occupation of Lebanon, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and obstruction of stabilization and reconstruction efforts in Iraq. The brutality and repression of the Syrian people by the regime not only endangers them but also generates instability in the region. The Syrian regime's actions, including the use of chemical weapons, support for terrorist organizations, and obstruction of the Lebanese government, continue to foster extremism and pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2004 and the measures taken to address it must continue beyond May 11, 2019. The United States also condemns the Assad regime's use of violence and human rights abuses and calls for a political transition in Syria that will lead to greater freedom, democracy, and justice. Changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Syrian government will be considered in determining whether to continue or terminate this national emergency in the future.
