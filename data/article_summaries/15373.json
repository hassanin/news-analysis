Vice President Biden attended a meeting in Mexico City to discuss the U.S.-Mexico Bilateral Forum on Higher Education, Innovation, and Research. This forum aims to improve educational achievement in both countries by bringing together individuals from government, universities, colleges, and research institutions to collaborate on educational and research programs. The Vice President highlighted the opportunities for increased academic and student exchange, joint research, and linkages among higher education and research organizations. The Bilateral Forum aligns with President Obama's 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative, which promotes academic exchange between the United States and Latin America, including Mexico. It also supports the goals of the U.S-Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue by fostering collaboration on new technologies and ideas to boost both economies.
