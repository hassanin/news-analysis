In this letter, President Barack Obama requests that Congress consider amendments to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 proposals in his FY 2011 Budget for the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice. These amendments aim to enhance federal border protection, law enforcement, and counternarcotics activities in order to secure the Southwest border. The requested budget authority for FY 2010 would increase by a net total of $500 million, partially offset by canceling $100 million from a lower priority program within the Department of Homeland Security. The President emphasizes that these proposals are urgent and essential, and requests that they be considered as emergency requirements. The details of the request are provided in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
