President Obama has announced new measures to protect the natural and cultural resources in the Alaskan Arctic Ocean. These actions include the creation of the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area, which aims to enhance the resilience of the environment and the sustainability of Alaskan native communities. The Obama Administration is also committing approximately $30 million in philanthropic funds for projects in rural northern Alaska and Canada, focusing on shipping, ecosystem science, community and ecological resilience, and tribal engagement. The Executive Order establishes a Task Force to coordinate federal activities in the region, consider traditional knowledge in decision making, and engage with regional tribal governments. The Order also addresses issues related to shipping, fishing, and oil and gas exploration. Additionally, the philanthropic community is pledging approximately $30 million for projects in rural northern Alaska and Canada, with a focus on community-led planning, low-impact shipping corridors, policy development informed by indigenous knowledge, fostering connections between northern priorities and social finance institutions, and building capacity of indigenous-led organizations. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation is also providing a $3.7 million grant for research on sea ice change in the Alaskan Arctic.
