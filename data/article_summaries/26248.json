President Donald J. Trump is prioritizing the deployment of secure and reliable 5G communications in the United States. This commitment is backed by policies that encourage innovation and investment in 5G readiness, with the aim of creating 3 million new jobs and adding $500 billion to the economy. To facilitate this investment, the largest spectrum auction in American history will take place in December. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) has released reports on Research and Development (R&D) Priorities for American Leadership in Wireless Communications and Emerging Technologies and their Expected Impact on Non-Federal Spectrum Demand. These reports will inform the National Spectrum Strategy and ensure American leadership in 5G and beyond. The reports highlight the need for R&D to improve spectrum use, spectrum awareness, and spectrum sharing. They also emphasize the importance of considering non-Federal demand for spectrum and the evolving ways in which emerging technologies enabled by 5G networks will utilize spectrum. The goal is to provide entrepreneurs and engineers with the necessary spectrum resources to innovate in America and maintain the country's position as a world leader in technology. The upcoming National Spectrum Strategy will focus on balancing spectrum management to support critical government services and future spectrum demands.
