Vice President Kamala Harris will be visiting Applied Materials in Sunnyvale, California to showcase the Biden-Harris Administration's focus on investing in semiconductor manufacturing and research and development. Applied Materials has announced a $4 billion investment in a new research and development facility called the EPIC Center, which will design next-generation tools for semiconductor manufacturing. This investment has been influenced by the CHIPS and Science Act signed by President Biden in August, which aims to strengthen the US semiconductor industry. During her visit, Vice President Harris will meet with executives from semiconductor companies to encourage further investment in American manufacturing and research. The CHIPS and Science Act includes a $53 billion federal investment to boost semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing and ensure the US remains at the forefront of industries like nanotechnology, clean energy, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Since the Biden-Harris Administration began, private companies have announced over $470 billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments, including $200 billion in semiconductor manufacturing. The Act not only incentivizes companies to invest in US semiconductor manufacturing but also supports research and development programs to drive American innovation and strengthen supply chains. Since the Act was signed, private companies have announced nearly $140 billion in investments in semiconductor production, supply chains, and research and development. The Department of Commerce has received 300 Statements of Interest from potential applicants for CHIPS incentives, covering projects in 37 states. The Biden-Harris Administration has been working to implement programs under the CHIPS and Science Act to support semiconductor manufacturing, research, supply chain resilience, and workforce development.
