President Obama has declared a major disaster in Virginia and ordered federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in the area affected by severe storms and straight-line winds from June 29 to July 1, 2012. The declaration allows for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in various counties and cities in Virginia. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures. Donald L. Keldsen has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
