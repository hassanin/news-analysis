President Biden is taking action to help Americans facing hardship from the COVID-19 pandemic in order to keep them in their homes. Currently, 1 in 5 renters and over 10 million homeowners are behind on their payments. People of color are particularly affected and at a higher risk of eviction and foreclosure. To address this, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Agriculture have extended and expanded forbearance and foreclosure relief programs. These actions build on previous steps taken by the President to extend foreclosure moratoriums. The efforts will cover 70% of existing single-family home mortgages. President Biden is committed to protecting homeownership and housing stability. Congress is urged to pass the American Rescue Plan, which includes a Homeowners Assistance Fund to provide $10 billion to struggling homeowners. The priority is to provide immediate relief, support communities of color, and offer a centralized resource for housing assistance.
