The White House has proclaimed September as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. The proclamation highlights the progress made in fighting prostate cancer, but also recognizes that it remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the need for better prevention, detection, and control of the disease. The National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are mentioned as organizations leading in research efforts. The proclamation calls for increased education about the disease and encourages citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to participate in activities that raise awareness about prostate cancer prevention and control.
