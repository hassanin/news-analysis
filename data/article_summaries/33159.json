First Lady Melania Trump has announced the installation of a sculpture called Floor Frame by Isamu Noguchi in the White House Rose Garden. This makes Noguchi the first Asian American artist to be represented in the White House collection. The sculpture, which represents the intersection of a tree and the ground, will be placed directly on the ground on the east terrace of the Rose Garden. It is described as both powerful and humble in scale, and it complements the authority of the Oval Office. The sculpture was gifted to the White House by the White House Historical Association in March 2020. Melania Trump expressed excitement about the installation, stating that it showcases diversity in the nation's finest art and highlights the contributions of Asian American artists to the country's landscape.
