President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Arkansas and ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts from severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from December 26, 2015, to January 22, 2016. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals and counties for temporary housing, home repairs, uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. Funding is also available for state and eligible local governments, nonprofit organizations, and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is coordinating federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional counties may be designated for assistance after damage assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
