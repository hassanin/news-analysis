In September 2009, President Obama announced a new policy to disclose records of White House visitors. This was seen as a commitment to an open and transparent government. The records of visitors from the previous 90-120 days would be made available online each month. The goal was to make the Obama administration the most open and transparent in history by allowing the public to know who was influencing policy decisions. Some appointments would be exempt from disclosure due to national security or confidentiality reasons. Previous administrations had fought against the disclosure of visitor logs, but the Obama administration reviewed the policy and decided to make the records public. The government reform organization, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), praised the new policy as a step towards transparency and accountability in government. The administration thanked CREW for their involvement in developing the policy.
