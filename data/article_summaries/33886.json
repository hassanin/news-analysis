The article discusses the criticism faced by President Trump for nominating judges to federal courts. The American Bar Association (ABA) has given "not qualified" ratings to some of Trump's nominees, which the author argues is a politically motivated decision. The author suggests that these ratings are a result of the nominees' conservative views and connections to Trump, rather than a fair assessment of their qualifications. The article argues that Democrats and liberal activists are trying to block Trump's judge picks because they do not align with their progressive agenda. The author emphasizes the importance of appointing judges who will uphold the US Constitution rather than pushing a social agenda.
