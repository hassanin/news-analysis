The Senate has made progress by reaching a bipartisan agreement on the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022, a version of the Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022. This bill, supported by President Biden, aims to provide benefits and healthcare services to veterans affected by toxic exposures. The PACT Act will improve access to benefits and services for veterans and their survivors, enable the Department of Veterans Affairs to add presumptive conditions more efficiently, and enhance the level of service provided to veterans. President Biden views supporting veterans as a priority and believes it is an issue that can bring Republicans and Democrats together. Passing the PACT Act would be a significant achievement for the well-deserving veterans.
