President Barack Obama has proclaimed December 17, 2009, as Wright Brothers Day to honor the achievements of Orville and Wilbur Wright. The Wright Brothers' 12-second flight on December 17, 1903, marked a significant milestone in aviation history, leading to the revolution in transportation and the bridging of vast distances between continents. The brothers' success exemplifies the American spirit of creativity and innovation, as they were self-taught and funded their experiments through their bicycle shop. Despite facing numerous challenges, such as design failures and skepticism from the public, the Wright Brothers persevered with determination and bold experimentation. The proclamation acknowledges that their legacy lives on in the work of modern American innovators who continue to push the boundaries of invention and discovery. The President emphasizes the importance of supporting entrepreneurs and celebrates the limitless potential of American ingenuity. The proclamation is in accordance with a joint resolution approved by Congress in 1963, designating December 17 as "Wright Brothers Day" and requesting the President to issue an annual proclamation for its observance.
