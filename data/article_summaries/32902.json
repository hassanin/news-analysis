President Trump has released his Legislative Outline for Rebuilding Infrastructure in America, calling upon Congress to help him achieve six principles for reversing the current state of infrastructure. The President aims to streamline the permitting and approval process for infrastructure projects, reduce the time it takes to get permits approved, and make a sustained investment in America's future. The Trump Administration has already rolled back regulations and approved major pipelines, and now seeks to rebuild the country with American workers and materials. The goal is to ensure that the infrastructure of the country does not crumble and decay.
