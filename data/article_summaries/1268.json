President Biden and his administration have announced a comprehensive strategy to combat gun violence and other violent crimes. The strategy includes preventative measures, addressing the flow of firearms used in crimes, and providing funding and support for law enforcement and community violence intervention programs. The administration aims to stem the flow of guns into the wrong hands by establishing zero tolerance for rogue gun dealers and maximizing the effectiveness of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in cracking down on violators. They will also launch multijurisdictional firearms trafficking strike forces to stop illegal gun trafficking across state lines. The strategy emphasizes the importance of data transparency and accountability in enforcing gun laws. Additionally, the administration plans to invest in evidence-based community violence intervention programs, expand summer programming and employment opportunities for young people, and help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully reenter their communities through workforce development programs and federal hiring initiatives. The administration is urging Congress to take further action, such as banning assault weapons and passing legislation to strengthen the gun background check system. They are also calling on mayors across the country to use their funding to launch and strengthen community violence intervention programs.
