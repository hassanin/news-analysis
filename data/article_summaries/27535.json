The International Criminal Court (ICC) has rejected a request to investigate American military and intelligence professionals who served in Afghanistan. This decision is seen as a major victory for these individuals and for the rule of law. The United States has consistently declined to join the ICC due to concerns about its prosecutorial powers, threat to national sovereignty, and other deficiencies. The US government emphasizes that American citizens are held to high legal and ethical standards and warns that any attempt to prosecute American, Israeli, or allied personnel will be met with a strong response.
