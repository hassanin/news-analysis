On National Air Traffic Control Day, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) commends the air traffic controllers and technicians who ensure safe and efficient air travel. With over 14,000 controllers and thousands of technicians, they help transport one billion air passengers and 44 billion pounds of air freight each year. Their work is vital to public safety and the economy. The administration is committed to modernizing the air traffic control system and enhancing airspace safety, with a proposed budget of over $5 billion for airport improvements and FAA infrastructure. This includes investments in next-generation technology and better communication between controllers and pilots. The day serves as a reminder to thank these professionals for their contributions to safe and efficient air travel.
