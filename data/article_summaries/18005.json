President Obama plans to request $50 million in his FY2010 budget to create the Social Innovation Fund, which aims to identify and expand effective non-profit programs. The fund will provide growth capital for these programs and improve the use of data and evaluation to ensure government funds are spent effectively. The First Lady, Michelle Obama, explained that the goal is to find successful programs and replicate their success in communities facing similar challenges. The fund will focus on priority areas such as education, healthcare, and economic opportunity, and will partner with foundations, philanthropists, and corporations to provide matching resources and technical assistance. The White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation will coordinate efforts to engage all Americans in solving national challenges. The fund was authorized in the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act.
