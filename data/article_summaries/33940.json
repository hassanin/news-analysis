This executive order, issued on May 15, 2018, aims to improve the management and efficiency of information technology (IT) in the federal government. The order recognizes that the government spends over $90 billion annually on IT, with a significant portion going towards maintaining outdated systems. The order states that modern IT systems would help reduce costs, enhance cybersecurity, and deliver better services to the American people. To achieve these goals, the order focuses on empowering agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and enhancing their visibility and control over IT resources. The order also emphasizes agency-wide IT consolidation, strengthening cybersecurity measures, and establishing knowledge and skill standards for IT personnel. Additionally, the order calls for CIOs to have a role in IT governance boards and grants hiring authorities to agencies to address shortages of qualified IT candidates. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is tasked with providing guidance to agencies to implement the requirements of this order.
