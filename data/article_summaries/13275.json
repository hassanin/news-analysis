President Obama is visiting Newark, New Jersey to meet with leaders who are working to rehabilitate and reintegrate formerly incarcerated individuals. The visit aims to highlight the benefits of these efforts, such as giving individuals a second chance, boosting the local economy, and reducing recidivism rates. The President will visit different sites to see these efforts firsthand. Press Secretary Josh Earnest responded to criticism from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, calling his comments irresponsible. Earnest also mentioned that he was not aware of Governor Christie's record on supporting these rehabilitation programs. The White House congratulated the people of Turkey on their recent elections but expressed concerns about media freedom during the campaign. The impact of the elections on the relationship between the Turks and the Kurds is still being assessed. The President is expected to discuss these issues during his upcoming trip to Turkey for the G20 summit. The White House offered support for the investigation into the plane crash in Egypt and has not made any recommendations regarding American pilots traversing the airspace. The release of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) text has not been finalized yet, but the President is committed to giving the public and Congress ample time to review it before signing. Speaker Paul Ryan's comments on immigration were criticized by Earnest, who noted that Ryan had previously blocked a bipartisan compromise on the issue. Despite this, Earnest expressed optimism about working together on criminal justice reform, trade, and tax reform. The process for handling undocumented immigrants being released from incarceration is handled by ICE, and the administration expects President Obama to make a decision on the Keystone pipeline before the end of his term. The exact timing of the decision is still unknown.
