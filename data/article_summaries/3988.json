President Joe Biden has issued an executive order to address the national emergency related to the information and communications technology and services supply chain. The order focuses on the risks posed by connected software applications developed or supplied by foreign adversaries, particularly the People's Republic of China. These applications can access and capture personal and proprietary business information, posing a threat to national security and the economy. The order revokes previous executive orders related to TikTok, WeChat, and Chinese software companies. It also establishes a process for evaluating and addressing the risks associated with connected software applications and provides recommendations for executive and legislative actions. The order emphasizes the protection of sensitive data and accountability for those who engage in serious human rights abuse. The Secretary of Commerce will play a key role in evaluating transactions and taking appropriate actions. The order includes definitions and general provisions, and it is intended to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to available resources.
