The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a statement regarding the inadvertent release of sensitive information during President Obama's trip to Afghanistan. White House Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, asked White House Counsel Neil Eggleston to investigate the incident and provide recommendations on how to prevent similar incidents in the future. The Counsel presented their findings and recommendations to the Chief of Staff, who accepted them and instructed various White House staff to implement them immediately. The recommendations include conducting briefings before the President's arrival to inform participants that their names and titles will be released to the press, clearing the names and titles of meeting participants with the National Security Council staff, and providing additional training to staff to improve handling of sensitive information. The review did not focus on assigning blame but rather on identifying process improvements to prevent future incidents. The Counsel had conversations with individuals involved in the incident to gather information and make recommendations. The President was briefed on the review and its findings.
