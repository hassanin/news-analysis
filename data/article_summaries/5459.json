The Department of Defense (DOD) has arranged a second flight to transport Nestlé S.A. formula from Ramstein Air Base in Germany to Washington Dulles International Airport. The formula will then be transported to a Nestlé facility in Pennsylvania. The DOD has contracted with FedEx Express to transport the shipment. This is part of Operation Fly Formula, which aims to import infant formula and get it to stores faster. The shipment consists of 114 pallets of Gerber Good Start® Extensive HA infant formula, which is hypoallergenic and serves a critical medical purpose. The first tranche of this shipment arrived in the United States on May 22. President Biden has taken several actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula, including invoking the Defense Production Act and reopening the Abbott Sturgis plant.
