In a recent meeting in the Vice President's office, leaders from various states discussed the impact of the recent Supreme Court ruling on abortion rights. The Vice President expressed concern about the Court's decision and emphasized the importance of women being able to make decisions about their own bodies without government interference. She also highlighted the healthcare crisis that this issue represents and the negative consequences it has for women and girls. The Vice President mentioned that some states have implemented strict abortion bans without exceptions for rape or incest, and even criminalized healthcare professionals who provide abortion services. She believes that this issue goes beyond just abortion and also affects other areas such as contraception and same-sex marriage. While she called on Congress to act, she also announced that President Biden has issued executive orders to protect women's rights to interstate travel and access to necessary medication. The meeting ended with a discussion among the leaders present.
