The Presidential Memoranda titled "National Strategy for Space Nuclear Power and Propulsion" establishes a national strategy to develop and use space nuclear power and propulsion (SNPP) systems in the United States. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of SNPP systems in maintaining and advancing U.S. dominance and strategic leadership in space. It outlines high-level policy goals and a roadmap to achieve these goals, including developing uranium fuel processing capabilities, demonstrating a fission power system on the Moon, establishing technical foundations for nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP), and developing advanced radioisotope power systems (RPS). The memorandum also highlights principles of safety, security, and sustainability in the development and use of SNPP systems, and assigns roles and responsibilities to various government agencies. The implementation of the strategy will be coordinated by the Vice President through the National Space Council.
