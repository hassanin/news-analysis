President Donald Trump has issued a notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13667 regarding the Central African Republic will continue beyond May 12, 2018. The situation in the Central African Republic is marked by a breakdown of law and order, sectarian tension, widespread violence, and the forced recruitment of child soldiers. These factors pose a threat to the peace, security, and stability of the country and its neighboring states, as well as to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
