On April 29, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to establish the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy (OTMP) within the White House Office. The OTMP's mission is to defend and serve American workers and domestic manufacturers while advising the President on policies to increase economic growth, decrease the trade deficit, and strengthen the United States manufacturing and defense industrial bases. The responsibilities of the OTMP include advising the President on trade policies, serving as a liaison between the White House and the Department of Commerce, and improving the performance of domestic procurement and hiring policies. The executive order clarifies that it does not impair the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also states that the order will be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
