The Second Lady, Karen Pence, recently observed an art therapy session at The Art Station in Fort Worth, Texas. The Art Station was founded in 2004 by Jane Avila with the aim of providing a physical space for the community to experience the benefits of art therapy. The therapists at The Art Station work with a wide range of clients, including the homeless, those with autism, children in trauma, veterans, and more. Karen Pence praised the therapists for their commitment to their profession and their dedication to their clients. She highlighted the positive impact that The Art Station has had on many lives and expressed her support for art therapy. She also encouraged people to follow her journey as she visits different locations to promote art therapy.
