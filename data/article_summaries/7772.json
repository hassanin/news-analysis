President Biden held a press conference in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to discuss his industrial strategy to bring back American manufacturing and promote the production of semiconductors and clean energy. He highlighted the achievements of his presidency so far, such as the creation of 10 million new jobs, a 3.5 percent unemployment rate, and the creation of nearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs. He emphasized the importance of the United States becoming a manufacturing hub and reducing its reliance on China for battery manufacturing. The president announced $2.8 billion in awards to 20 companies to build electric vehicles and battery production facilities in the United States. These investments are expected to create thousands of good-paying jobs and generate $9 billion in total investment for American manufacturing and the battery supply chain. Additionally, President Biden launched the American Battery Materials Initiative to secure America's electric vehicle battery supply chain and clean energy future. The initiative will be led by the White House and the Department of Energy, with support from the Department of Interior, and will prioritize respecting the rights of tribes, creating good-paying union jobs, and protecting the environment and local communities.
