The White House is requesting the Senate's advice and consent to ratify the Treaty between the United States and Jordan on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters. The Treaty aims to enhance cooperation between the two countries in investigating and prosecuting various crimes. It includes provisions for sharing evidence, arranging for witnesses to travel, serving documents, executing searches and seizures, locating persons or items, and freezing and forfeiting assets related to criminal activities. The President recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty.
