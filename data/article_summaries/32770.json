President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring the week of September 16 to September 22, 2018, as "National Gang Violence Prevention Week." The proclamation highlights the increasing prevalence of gang violence in communities across the country, particularly from gangs like MS-13. The administration commits to continue efforts to identify and eradicate gangs that spread violence and murder. The Department of Justice is partnering with local law enforcement to combat gang violence through initiatives like Project Safe Neighborhoods. The administration is also addressing transnational criminal organizations, especially MS-13, by increasing interagency efforts and creating collaborative task forces. While progress has been made in prosecuting gang-based crimes, the proclamation emphasizes the need for secure borders and closed loopholes in immigration laws to fully address the issue. The proclamation calls for the observance of the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities and reaffirms support for law enforcement.
