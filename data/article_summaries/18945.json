The article discusses President Obama's statement on the 35th anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The President emphasizes the importance of providing equal access to education for all children, regardless of their abilities. He acknowledges that in the past, children with disabilities were not given the necessary support and accommodations for their success. However, today, nearly 6.6 million students with disabilities rely on the provisions of IDEA to ensure they have the same educational rights as other children. The President highlights the need for equal opportunity and access, as well as holding children with disabilities to high standards and accountability. He also recognizes that disability rights are civil rights and pledges to enforce those rights to uphold America's founding principles. The President concludes by celebrating the progress made but acknowledges the ongoing work needed to create a more perfect union.
