The White House has launched the Data-Driven Justice Initiative (DDJ), which aims to disrupt the cycle of incarceration in the United States. The initiative, supported by a bipartisan coalition of 67 city, county, and state governments, seeks to divert low-level offenders with mental illness out of the criminal justice system and change approaches to pre-trial incarceration. The DDJ communities will use data to identify individuals with the highest number of contacts with police, ambulance, emergency departments, and other services, and link them to health, behavioral health, and social services in the community. The initiative also includes commitments from various organizations to provide support in areas such as data analysis, technical assistance, and research on effective practices.
