The groundbreaking on Foxconn's $10 billion factory in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin represents a milestone for the United States. The factory, which will produce state-of-the-art flat-panel displays, will be one of the largest factories ever built in the country. It is expected to employ 13,000 workers and is one of the largest foreign direct investments in the United States. The project would not have happened without the promise of the Trump tax cuts and the President's personal intervention. This factory is the first of many investments in advanced manufacturing facilities being reshored from overseas locations back to the United States. President Trump played an active role in economic development, meeting with Foxconn CEO Terry Gou multiple times and having weekly calls with Foxconn executives. The Trump administration's business-friendly tax, trade, and regulatory policies have made the United States an attractive place for investment. Rebuilding the consumer electronics manufacturing sector is important for the United States to regain its footing in large-scale production. Since President Trump took office, over 300,000 new manufacturing jobs have been created in the United States.
