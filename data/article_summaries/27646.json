President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring May 6 to May 12, 2018 as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. In the proclamation, Trump encourages everyone in hurricane-prone areas to make necessary preparations for the upcoming hurricane season. He highlights the devastating impact of last year's hurricane season, which saw three Category 4 hurricanes cause immense damage and loss of life. The proclamation emphasizes the need for individuals and communities to be prepared and take steps to mitigate hurricane-related harm. It also calls for federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial emergency management officials to inform communities about hurricane preparedness and response. The proclamation recognizes the ongoing National Level Exercise 2018, which aims to test the ability of various organizations to protect, respond, and recover from a major hurricane.
