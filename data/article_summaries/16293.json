The President has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate regarding Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. This section states that a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and transmits it to Congress stating that the emergency is to continue. The President has sent a notice stating that the emergency declared with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process will continue beyond January 23, 2011. The President believes that the crisis with these terrorists has not been resolved and that their actions pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain economic sanctions against these terrorists.
