President Biden and Vice President Harris recently hosted an event to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Prior to the event, a roundtable discussion was held with Black women leaders to discuss key issues for Black families and communities. The discussion focused on recent actions taken by President Biden to support women in the workplace and advance racial equity. These actions include the passing of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and the PUMP Act for Nursing Mothers, which guarantee reasonable accommodations for pregnant and postpartum workers and extend break time and private space protections for nursing parents. These laws are particularly important for addressing the higher risk of pregnancy-related complications and maternal mortality among Black women, as well as gender and racial pay disparities. Additionally, President Biden issued a Presidential Memorandum calling on federal agencies to provide access to leave for federal employees, including during their first year of service, in order to support and advance women's economic security. The participants in the roundtable discussion praised the administration's ongoing commitment to racial equity and supporting families across the country.
