The President has expressed his support for the House Financial Services Committee's passage of the Small Business Lending Fund Act of 2010. He believes that small businesses are crucial to the American economy and the creation of new jobs. The President has already signed a jobs bill that provides tax cuts to small businesses that hire new workers. He has also proposed eliminating capital gains taxes on small business investments and offering new tax breaks for all businesses to invest in new plants and equipment. However, one of the main challenges faced by small business owners is access to credit for growth and hiring. The President is pleased that the Committee has included two important Administration proposals in the legislation - a Small Business Lending Fund that incentivizes smaller banks to make new loans, and a State Small Business Credit Initiative that would encourage over $20 billion in new lending through state-based programs. The President thanks Chairman Frank and the members of the Committee for their leadership and urges Congress to continue swiftly on more job creation measures until every American who wants work can find it.
