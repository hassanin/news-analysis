The U.S.-Caribbean-Central American Energy Summit took place in Washington, D.C. and was chaired by Vice President Biden. The Summit brought together Caribbean and Central American heads of government and energy ministers, as well as multilateral development banks, the private sector, and other international partners. The Summit was the culmination of the work of the U.S.-Caribbean-Central American Energy Security Task Force, which was launched by President Obama in April 2015 with the goal of advancing energy security, promoting clean energy integration, and enhancing regional energy cooperation. The Task Force presented a report to leaders at the Summit, recommending actions to improve energy security and integration, increase clean energy investment, and enhance regional energy cooperation. The Summit also included meetings between heads of government and the private sector to explore new opportunities for trade, investment, and innovation in the energy sector. The United States is committed to working with the Caribbean and Central American regions to create more efficient energy systems at lower costs. Key initiatives include supporting regional energy coordination, promoting Central America regional integration, addressing regional challenges, providing a pathway for fuel transition, and catalyzing a cleaner and more secure energy future. These initiatives involve investments in renewable energy, clean energy finance, expanding access to clean energy, greening the tourism industry, and building capacity for clean energy transitions. The United States is confident that this region can become a model for clean and efficient energy generation and use in the Western Hemisphere.
