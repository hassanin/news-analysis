Today's report indicates that core inflation is decreasing and approaching pre-pandemic levels, despite a strong employment market. Unemployment has remained below 4% for 19 consecutive months, the percentage of employed working-age Americans is at its highest in two decades, and real wages are higher than pre-pandemic levels. Although overall inflation has decreased significantly over the past year, the recent increase in gas prices has strained family budgets. To address this issue, the focus remains on reducing energy costs, including investments in clean energy to enhance energy security. The aim is to build an economy that benefits the middle class and lower-income individuals, while some Republicans in Congress advocate for tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations, as well as severe cuts to programs that hard-working Americans rely on.
