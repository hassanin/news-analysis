The article is a press gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz, who is en route back to Washington, DC on Air Force One. Schultz begins by welcoming everyone and making a statement about the United States' support for the agreement reached between the Republic of Korea and North Korea. He then takes questions from the press.

The first question is about the President's comments from the previous night, specifically referring to the term "crazies" and the opposition to it. Schultz explains that the President may have been a little flip in his language, but that he was referring to Republicans who have done irresponsible things in the past, such as shutting down the government.

When asked about the specific problems the President was referring to, Schultz mentions the budget and long-term infrastructure as examples. He is then questioned about whether the President thinks his rhetoric is helpful to the debate, to which Schultz responds that the President may have been a little too flip but that he and Senator Reid were discussing the challenges they face in the coming months.

The press then asks for clarification on who the "crazies" are, to which Schultz explains that the President was referring to Republicans who propose irresponsible actions, such as watering down Wall Street Reform. When asked if the President regrets his comments, Schultz says no.

The discussion then shifts to other topics, such as the upcoming visit of the Chinese President and the engagement between the United States and China. Schultz emphasizes the importance of engagement and cooperation with China on various issues. He is then asked about the Iran nuclear deal and whether opposition to it makes someone "crazy." Schultz explains that the President believes the deal is the best way to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and that those claiming they can get a better deal are "between na√Øve and unrealistic."

The press also asks about Vice President Biden's potential White House run, but Schultz declines to comment on private conversations between the President and Vice President. He reiterates that the decision process for Biden needs to be protected and that it will be an intensely personal decision.

Other topics discussed include funding for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran's hostile rhetoric towards Israel, Guantanamo Bay, the deficit projections by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the stock market rebound, and climate change. Schultz mentions the progress made on climate change and the opposition faced from entrenched interests, such as the Koch brothers. He also mentions the ongoing review of the Keystone Pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations.

The press gaggle concludes with Schultz stating that he does not have any updates on certain topics and encouraging reporters to reach out to relevant departments for more information.
