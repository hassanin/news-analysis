In this letter, Dana A. Remus, Counsel to the President, responds to a communication from David Ferriero, Archivist of the United States, regarding former President Trump's assertion of executive privilege over certain documents requested by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. President Biden has considered the former President's assertion and consulted with the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice. The President has concluded that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the best interests of the United States and therefore rejects the former President's assertion. President Biden instructs the Archivist to provide the pages identified as privileged by the former President to the Select Committee within 30 days, unless there is an intervening court order.
