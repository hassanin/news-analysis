President Barack Obama has signed into law H.R. 2194, the "Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010". This Act aims to pressure Iran by imposing sanctions on those investing in Iran's petroleum resources and exporting petroleum and related items to Iran. It also requires sanctions on financial institutions involved in certain activities with Iran. The Act includes new authorities to support the rights of Iranians and punish those who have violated their rights. It provides a tool to address Iran's development of nuclear weapons and support of terrorism while allowing flexibility in timing and calibrating sanctions. The Act also grants special authority to waive petroleum-related sanctions for countries closely cooperating in multilateral efforts to constrain Iran, based on their key role in these efforts. The President can exercise this authority when it is vital to US national security interests.
