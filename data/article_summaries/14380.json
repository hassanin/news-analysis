The Republic of Liberia has reached a milestone of 42 days without reporting a new Ebola case, leading to the World Health Organization declaring the end of the country's current outbreak. The White House congratulates Liberia on this achievement and reaffirms its commitment to ending the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and assisting in the rebuilding process. However, it is important to note that the Ebola outbreak still persists in neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea, and the global community must remain vigilant until the entire region reaches zero Ebola cases. It is crucial for countries to work together in strengthening capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks before they escalate into epidemics.
