The White House has announced that the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia will continue beyond October 21, 2011. The declaration, made on October 21, 1995, was due to the ongoing threat posed by these traffickers to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The actions of these traffickers have led to extreme levels of violence, corruption, and harm both in the US and abroad. To maintain pressure on these individuals, the US will continue to block their property and interests in the country and deny them access to the US market and financial system.
