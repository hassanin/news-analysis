Four members of President Obama's Cabinet, including Energy Secretary Steven Chu, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, have published op-ed columns in regional newspapers advocating for a comprehensive energy plan. They argue that such a plan will create clean-energy jobs, reduce dependence on foreign oil, and address climate change. They emphasize the need for bipartisan support and strong incentives for clean energy. The op-eds highlight the economic opportunities and potential for revitalizing rural America through addressing climate change and promoting renewable energy.
