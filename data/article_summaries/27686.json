This article discusses an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on January 31, 2019, with the aim of strengthening Buy-American principles in federal financial assistance programs. The order emphasizes the policy of maximizing the use of goods, products, and materials produced in the United States in federal procurements and through the terms and conditions of federal financial assistance awards. The order provides definitions for terms such as "produced in the United States," "federal financial assistance," "manufactured products," and "infrastructure project." It also outlines the application of Buy-American principles to covered programs and directs agencies to identify opportunities to maximize the use of American-made products in contracts and subcontracts related to infrastructure projects. The order also amends a previous executive order and includes general provisions regarding implementation, applicable law, and the creation of rights or benefits.
