President Donald Trump announced $42.4 million in new grant awards for law enforcement to fund over 50 innovative projects through the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program. The grants will support law enforcement efforts to tackle the nation's drug crisis, including using new technologies to track overdoses and overdose deaths. The HIDTA Program coordinates the efforts of federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners in disrupting and dismantling drug trafficking organizations. President Trump has dedicated unprecedented support to address the opioid crisis and ensure that states and communities have the resources they need to prevent drug use, treat addiction, and stop the flow of drugs into their communities. This year, many of the discretionary grants have a specific focus on reducing the availability of opioids, particularly the synthetic opioid fentanyl.
