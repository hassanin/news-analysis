Black Maternal Health Week is an urgent reminder of the pain and loss experienced by many families during pregnancy. Black women in America are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women, and the country has higher maternal mortality rates compared to other developed nations. Institutional racism and systemic inequities contribute to these high rates, with Black women often being dismissed or ignored in healthcare settings. Lack of access to safe housing, transportation barriers, pollution, and food insecurity also impact maternal health. The Biden Administration has taken steps to address this crisis, including writing the Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis and securing funding for its implementation. Vice President Kamala Harris has been a leader in improving maternal health outcomes and addressing disparities in care. The American Rescue Plan allows states to provide a full year of postpartum coverage to Medicaid beneficiaries, and efforts are being made to expand and diversify the maternal health workforce. The Department of Health and Human Services has created a "Birthing Friendly" hospital designation, and the No Surprises Act helps protect women from unexpected medical bills. Mental health support, job security, workplace rights, and addressing racial disparities are also priorities. The Biden Administration aims to make pregnancy and childbirth safe and joyful for all, recognizing that healthcare is a right and not a privilege. Black Maternal Health Week is a call to raise awareness, understand the consequences of institutional racism, amplify the voices of Black women, and work towards a world where they do not have to fear for their safety or well-being during and after pregnancy.
