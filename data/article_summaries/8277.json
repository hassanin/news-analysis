The memorandum is regarding the extension and expansion of eligibility for Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Liberians in the United States. Since 1991, the US has provided safe haven for Liberians who fled their country due to armed conflict and civil strife. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was granted to them, which ended in 2007. Subsequently, DED was granted by President Bush, extended by President Obama, and then extended again by President Trump. In December 2019, the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness (LRIF) provision was included in the National Defense Authorization Act, allowing eligible Liberians to apply for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residents. The application process faced challenges, and an extension was granted for the application period, but employment authorization was not included. In January 2021, DED was reinstated until June 30, 2022, to allow employment authorization during the LRIF application period. The memorandum states that there are foreign policy reasons to further extend DED for Liberians in the US until June 30, 2024. It also includes provisions for employment authorization. The Secretary of Homeland Security is instructed to implement these measures and publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
