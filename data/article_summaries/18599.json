First Lady Michelle Obama has been named the sponsor of the new Navy submarine, USS Illinois. This honor was accepted during her visit with the first contingent of women submariners to be assigned to the Navy's operational submarine force. The women submariners were accepted into the Navy's nuclear submarine program after completing intensive training and are now serving on ballistic and guided missile submarines throughout the Navy. The First Lady joins a tradition of First Lady sponsorship of U.S. Navy submarines, with Laura Bush serving as the sponsor of USS Texas and Hillary Clinton serving as the sponsor of USS Columbia. As the sponsor of USS Illinois, the First Lady will establish a special link to the submarine, its sailors, and their families throughout its life. She also serves as the sponsor for the Coast Guard Cutter Stratton, which is named after Captain Dorothy Stratton, the director of the Coast Guard Women's Reserve during World War II.
