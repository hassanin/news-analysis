President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring November 2015 as National College Application Month. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of expanding access to affordable higher education and highlights the role of a college degree in achieving economic mobility. The Obama administration has made efforts to provide students and families with information on college costs, value, and admissions through initiatives such as the redesigned Department of Education's College Scorecard and the Better Make Room campaign. The administration has also focused on making community college more affordable, with a plan to provide two years of free community college for those willing to work for it. In addition, the administration has worked to streamline the process for obtaining federal financial aid and has implemented measures to make loans more manageable for students and families. The proclamation calls upon public officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe National College Application Month and encourages activities and programs designed to encourage students to make plans for and apply to college.
