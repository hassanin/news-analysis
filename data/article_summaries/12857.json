On November 27, 2013, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 1848, known as the "Small Airplane Revitalization Act of 2013," requires the Federal Aviation Administration to improve the safety and development of small airplanes by reorganizing certification requirements for these planes by December 15, 2015. 

The second bill, H.R. 3204, titled the "Drug Quality and Security Act," grants the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority to regulate specialty compounded drugs. It also establishes a voluntary program for FDA regulation of entities involved in batch compounding. Additionally, the bill allows FDA to create a national track-and-trace system to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain and reduce the risk of contamination, adulteration, diversion, or counterfeiting.

The third bill, S. 252, referred to as the "PREEMIE Reauthorization Act," expands the activities of the Department of Health and Human Services regarding preterm labor and delivery. It establishes a National Pediatric Research Network as part of the National Institutes of Health's Pediatric Research Initiative. The bill also provides funding for the care and maintenance of retired chimpanzees used in NIH research programs within a sanctuary system.
