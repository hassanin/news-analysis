This declaration allows for federal funding to be allocated to state, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency protective measures. W. Russell Webster has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further assessments.
