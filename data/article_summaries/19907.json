The article discusses the passage of the Tribal Law and Order Act, which aims to address the public safety challenges faced by tribal communities in the United States. American Indians and Alaska Natives experience higher rates of violent crime compared to the general population, with some tribes experiencing crime rates over ten times the national average. Additionally, one in three Native women will be a victim of rape in their lifetime. The Act aims to improve the relationship between the federal government and tribal governments, enhance collaboration in crime investigation and prosecution, and provide resources for tribes to combat crime more effectively. The President commends the members of Congress who played a role in passing the bill and looks forward to signing it into law.
