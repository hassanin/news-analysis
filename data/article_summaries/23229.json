In this article, it is mentioned that President Obama called Governor Jerry Brown to discuss the drought situation in California. The President expressed his concern for the citizens affected by the historic drought and assured Governor Brown of federal support. The government agencies are working together to provide resources and assistance to help California and other affected states prepare for and mitigate the impacts of the drought. The USDA is collaborating with farmers and ranchers to improve irrigation water efficiency and protect vulnerable soils. The Bureau of Reclamation is also working closely with federal and state authorities to facilitate water transfers and storage, as well as promote actions that conserve and move water to critical areas. The National Drought Resilience Partnership (NDRP) will coordinate the federal response and collaborate with state, local government, agriculture, and other partners. The President assured Governor Brown that federal partners, including FEMA, will continue to support the state and local response during this challenging time.
