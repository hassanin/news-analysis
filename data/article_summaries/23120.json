The Presidential Memorandum titled "Mitigating Impacts on Natural Resources from Development and Encouraging Related Private Investment" emphasizes the importance of leaving America's natural resources in better condition than they were found. The memorandum recognizes that federal agencies have the responsibility to balance economic development and national security goals with environmental goals. It encourages agencies to adopt a consistent approach for avoiding and minimizing harmful impacts to natural resources, as well as compensating for any impacts that do occur. The memorandum also promotes private investment in natural resource restoration and public-private partnerships. It establishes principles for mitigation, such as using large-scale plans to guide decision-making, setting net benefit goals for natural resources, and prioritizing advance compensation mechanisms. The memorandum directs specific actions to be taken by the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, and Defense, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to strengthen mitigation policies and support private investment in restoration.
