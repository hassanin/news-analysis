The article announces the completion of the U.S.-Russia "Megatons to Megawatts" program, which is considered one of the most successful non-proliferation programs. The program involved the conversion of 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium from Russian nuclear warheads into low-enriched uranium, which was then used as fuel for U.S. nuclear power reactors. This program has supplied nearly ten percent of all U.S. electricity over the past fifteen years. The United States and Russia are committed to continuing collaboration in nonproliferation, nuclear security, and nuclear research and development.
