In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest discussed a meeting that President Obama will have with a bipartisan group of national security and diplomacy experts to discuss the strategic importance of setting the rules of the road for global trade in the Asia Pacific. The group will discuss how high-standards trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), can bolster the U.S. economy and strengthen relationships abroad. The President will also discuss the importance of ensuring that the South China Sea remains open to the free flow of commerce and the freedom of navigation. Earnest also addressed the recent airstrike in Raqqa, Syria that targeted Mohammed Emwazi, also known as "Jihadi John." While it is not confirmed, the airstrike is believed to have killed Emwazi. Earnest stated that the airstrike is consistent with the strategy to apply pressure to ISIL leaders and to use intelligence to advance goals. He also confirmed that the families of hostages who have been killed in Syria were contacted in advance of public reports about the airstrike. Earnest also discussed the recent misconduct allegations against a Secret Service agent and confirmed that the President has confidence in Director Clancy.
