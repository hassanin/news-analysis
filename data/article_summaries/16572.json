President Obama expressed his deep sadness over the passing of Jim Tyree, a prominent figure in Chicago. Tyree, who came from humble beginnings on the South Side, worked his way to success but never forgot his roots. He was known for his philanthropic efforts, including his work with non-profit organizations and serving on the board of the University of Chicago Medical Center. Tyree also played a crucial role in reviving the Sun Times newspaper. The President extended his condolences to Tyree's wife, Eve, and their three children during this difficult time.
