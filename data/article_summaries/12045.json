This article is a Presidential Memorandum from June 07, 2013, discussing the importance of transforming the nation's electric grid through improved siting, permitting, and review processes. The memorandum emphasizes the need to modernize and expand the electric transmission grid in order to improve energy reliability and resiliency, minimize power outages, manage cyber-security threats, and create cost savings for consumers. It highlights the importance of collaboration among federal, state, local, and tribal governments, and the designation of energy right-of-way corridors on federal lands to expedite the siting, permitting, and review processes for transmission projects. The memorandum also calls for the assessment and synthesis of current research related to transmission planning and renewable energy resources, as well as the development of integrated, interagency pre-application processes for significant onshore electric transmission projects. Overall, the memorandum aims to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, predictability, and transparency of the siting, permitting, and review processes for transmission projects.
