President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has vetoed the joint resolution, S.J. Res. 24, which sought to disapprove the final rule entitled "Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Endangered Species Status for Northern Long-Eared Bat." The rule, issued by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), aimed to provide protections under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the northern long-eared bat, a species heavily impacted by white-nose syndrome. The disease has spread across the majority of the bat's range and is expected to affect the entire species by the end of the decade, causing significant population declines. The USFWS listed the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species after reviewing scientific and commercial information about the threats and ongoing conservation efforts. President Biden believes that S.J. Res. 24 would undermine the science-based rulemaking process and weaken the ESA. Bats play a crucial role in ecosystems, providing pest control and pollination services that contribute at least $3 billion annually to the US agriculture economy. The President's veto aims to protect the species and uphold wildlife conservation traditions in the United States.
