The President held a meeting in the Cabinet Room to discuss two upcoming votes in Congress on immigration legislation. He was joined by Chairman of the House Judiciary, Bob Goodlatte, and other members of Congress. The President emphasized the need to close loopholes in immigration laws that are exploited by criminals and terrorists, particularly MS-13 gang members. The House will vote on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which cuts federal grant money to cities that protect criminal aliens, and Kate's Law, which enhances penalties for illegal reentry into the country. The President also acknowledged the presence of families who have lost loved ones due to illegal immigration and expressed support for law enforcement. He called on Congress to pass these immigration enforcement measures quickly.
