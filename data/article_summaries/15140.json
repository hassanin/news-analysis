The White House will be hosting an event called "ConnectED to the Future" on November 19. The event will bring together superintendents and educators from across the country to discuss the transition to digital learning. This event builds on the ConnectED Initiative, which aims to connect 99% of students to high-speed internet and provide teachers with the necessary technology to transform teaching and learning. The Future Ready Pledge, launched this fall, is an important part of this initiative, encouraging school districts to develop a culture of innovative teaching using technology. During the event, President Obama will host a digital pledge signing ceremony with over one hundred superintendents, and hundreds more will join virtually. Since the ConnectED Initiative was announced, over $4 billion in public and private funding has been committed to expanding internet connectivity in schools. More details about the event will be released at a later date.
