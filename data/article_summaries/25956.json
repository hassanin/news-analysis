President Trump signed an executive order directing the federal government to replace degree-based hiring with skill-based hiring. The order aims to expand opportunities for Americans to find jobs based on their skills and talents rather than their educational background. The President emphasized the need to rebuild the economy and bring back the jobs lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He also highlighted the success of the Pledge to America's Workers, which has secured commitments to over 16 million job and training opportunities from employers across the nation. Several members of the Workforce Policy Advisory Board, including Ivanka Trump, Marillyn Hewson, Sebastian Thrun, Ginni Rometty, and Jovita Carranza, praised the President's leadership and shared success stories of individuals who have benefited from reskilling and training programs.
