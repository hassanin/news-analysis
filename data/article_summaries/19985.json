This article is a presidential memorandum from September 30, 2011, issued by President Barack Obama. The memorandum discusses the fiscal year 2012 refugee admissions numbers and authorizations of in-country refugee status. It states that up to 76,000 refugees will be admitted to the United States during FY 2012 for humanitarian concerns or national interest. The memorandum also provides regional allocations for these admissions, with specific numbers for Africa, East Asia, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America/Caribbean, Near East/South Asia, and an unallocated reserve. The Secretary of State is authorized to use unallocated admissions where additional need arises and transfer unused admissions between regions if necessary. The memorandum also determines that assistance to persons applying for admission to the United States as part of the overseas refugee admissions program will contribute to the foreign policy interests of the United States. It specifies certain groups of people who may be considered refugees for admission within their countries of nationality or habitual residence, including persons in Cuba, Eurasia and the Baltics, Iraq, and persons identified by a United States Embassy in exceptional circumstances. The determination is to be reported to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
