The White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships has been reestablished under President Biden's administration with the aim of promoting partnerships to serve people in need. The Office has collaborated with various government agencies such as HHS, DHS, HUD, USDA, VA, ED, USAID, SBA, AmeriCorps, EPA, UST, and DOC, as well as faith and community leaders across the nation and the world. These partnerships have contributed to progress in areas such as hosting vaccination clinics, preventing evictions, facilitating the return to school and employment, and other acts of service. The administration is also focused on promoting religious equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility, as well as protecting the right to practice faith without fear in the face of rising attacks against people of faith. The administration's achievements include addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, boosting economic recovery, advancing opportunities for historically disadvantaged communities, combating systematic racism, protecting religious freedom, and working with faith and community groups to protect the environment.
