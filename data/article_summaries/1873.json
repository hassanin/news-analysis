Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy Council, and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the President and Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, recently chaired a working meeting with state legislators from 11 states. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss actions that can be taken to expand training opportunities for reproductive health care providers.

Following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, extremist officials in over a dozen states have implemented laws that criminalize abortion care provided by health care professionals. These laws not only have a devastating impact on women but also jeopardize the training of future medical providers in routine and evidence-based reproductive health care. This means that many new physicians may not receive the necessary training to provide essential and timely health care services, such as care for pregnancy loss.

During the meeting, state legislators shared the steps they are taking to expand access to training for reproductive health care providers. For example, California has enacted legislation and allocated $20 million to fund targeted provider recruitment, retention, and training. Maryland and New Jersey have also allocated funds to support clinical training, and other states are building on existing measures to support reproductive health care providers. Illinois recently passed a comprehensive reproductive rights package that includes provisions to grant temporary licenses to out-of-state practitioners under certain circumstances.

The White House Senior Officials expressed gratitude to the state leaders for their work and ongoing partnership in protecting access to reproductive health care. Their leadership serves as a contrast to Republican elected officials who are focused on banning abortion and criminalizing providers.
