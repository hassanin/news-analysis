He accused Democrats of playing politics and being willing to let struggling Americans go unprotected. McEnany reiterated the administration's focus on extending unemployment benefits and preventing evictions. She criticized Democrats for not endorsing the Martha McSally bill, which would have extended unemployment insurance. McEnany also addressed other topics, including the response to COVID-19, social media censorship, and the travel ban.
