The White House has announced new sanctions on Iran to further isolate the Iranian government for failing to meet its international obligations. The sanctions target Iran's currency, the rial, by imposing sanctions on foreign financial institutions that conduct significant transactions involving the rial. This is the first time trade in the rial has been directly targeted for sanctions. The sanctions also target those who engage in significant financial or other transactions for the sale of goods or services used in Iran's automotive sector. Additionally, sanctions will be imposed on those who provide material support to designated Iranian persons. These measures are part of President Obama's commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, but the door to a diplomatic solution remains open if Iran meets its obligations.
