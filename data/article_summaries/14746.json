President Barack Obama issued a statement on the unjust detention of Sarah Shourd, Shane Bauer, and Josh Fattal by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The three individuals were detained a year ago while hiking along the Iran-Iraq border. President Obama emphasized that they committed no crime and called for their immediate release. He stated that they are innocent and have never worked for the United States government, but are simply open-minded and adventurous young people who represent the best of America. The President urged the Iranian government to act in line with principles of justice and human rights by allowing Sarah, Shane, and Josh to be reunited with their families. He acknowledged the suffering of their families and expressed his support for their advocacy. President Obama also mentioned the case of Robert Levinson, an American who went missing in Iran three years ago, and called on the Iranian government to provide any information about his whereabouts and facilitate his return to his family. The President emphasized the importance of justice and the shared dignity of all human beings. He reassured that the U.S. government will continue to work towards the release of its citizens who are unjustly detained abroad.
