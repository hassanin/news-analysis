Vice President Kamala Harris convened state legislative leaders from Indiana, Florida, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Montana who are fighting to protect reproductive rights. These states have Republican-controlled legislatures and governors and may soon call special sessions to pass abortion bans. The Vice President discussed the Administration's actions to defend abortion rights, including the President's signing of the Executive Order Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services. The leaders shared concerns about limiting reproductive health care access, patient privacy, and attacks on voting rights and LGBTQI+ rights. They reaffirmed their commitment to working together to protect reproductive rights for all women.
