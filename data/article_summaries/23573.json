The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a conference call with Jason Furman and Betsey Stevenson from the Council of Economic Advisers to discuss the CBO report on minimum wage. The report found that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would benefit 16.5 million workers and help reduce poverty. While the CBO estimated a 0.3 percent decrease in employment, the White House argues that the overall consensus of economists is that the minimum wage has little to no impact on employment. They believe that raising the minimum wage increases motivation, reduces distractions related to poverty, and improves productivity. The White House is confident that the report will not change the public perception and will continue to push for minimum wage passage in Congress.
