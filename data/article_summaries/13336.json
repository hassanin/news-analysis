The National Economic Council of the United States hosted a meeting with Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. They discussed Saudi Arabia's commitment to economic reform and the United States' desire to be a key partner in helping them implement their reform program. Both sides agreed on the importance of economic diversification, expanding private sector employment opportunities, renewable and natural gas development, and the role U.S. companies could play in implementing Saudi reform objectives. They plan to continue these conversations in the coming months to further deepen their economic ties.
