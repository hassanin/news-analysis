This article is a memorandum from the White House Office of the Press Secretary. It states that the President has made determinations regarding the efforts of foreign governments in combating human trafficking. The determinations include withholding certain non-humanitarian, non-trade-related assistance for countries such as Equatorial Guinea, Iran, South Sudan, Sudan, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe until they comply with minimum standards or make significant efforts to do so. The memorandum also instructs the United States Executive Director of multilateral development banks and the International Monetary Fund to vote against providing loans or utilizing funds for certain countries until they comply with the minimum standards. The memorandum includes provisions for waivers and exceptions for certain countries based on their compliance efforts or national interest. The President's certification required by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act is also provided. The memorandum concludes by authorizing its submission to Congress and publication in the Federal Register.
