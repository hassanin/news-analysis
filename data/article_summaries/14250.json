In this letter from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, he discusses the need to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Obama argues that the facility undermines American national security, provides propaganda for terrorists, drains military resources, and harms partnerships with allies. He states that the costs of keeping it open outweigh the complications involved in closing it. Obama highlights the progress made in transferring detainees out of Guantanamo and mentions the Department of Defense's comprehensive plan to close the facility. He criticizes Congress for imposing restrictions that prevent detainees from being imprisoned in the United States, claiming that there is no justification for keeping the facility open. Obama urges Congress to close Guantanamo in a responsible and secure manner, emphasizing that it goes against American values and tarnishes the country's reputation.
