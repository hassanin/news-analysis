The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released the Administration's Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 National Drug Control Budget, requesting a record $34.6 billion for counter-drug efforts. This represents a $1.3 billion funding increase from the previous fiscal year. The request includes $6.6 billion in Federal resources to reduce deaths resulting from illicit opioid use. The budget funds drug control priorities across 14 Executive Branch departments and agencies, the Federal Judiciary, and the District of Columbia. President Trump's FY 2020 request represents a 20% increase over the final FY 2017 level.
