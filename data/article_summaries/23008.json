President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring December 3rd as Helsinki Human Rights Day. The proclamation recognizes the Helsinki Final Act, a document signed forty years ago by leaders from the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union, and countries from across a divided Europe. The Act reflects the belief that the security of states is linked to the security of their citizens' rights. It calls for the recognition of human dignity and human rights, respect for the sovereignty of states, and the restraint from the threat or use of force. The proclamation acknowledges the progress made in advancing security, democracy, and human rights in the OSCE region over the last four decades, but also acknowledges the challenges that still exist, such as Russian aggression and restrictions on fundamental freedoms. The proclamation condemns recent terrorist attacks and reaffirms the commitment to fight against terrorism and violent extremism. It calls for the implementation of the shared Helsinki commitments to create a more democratic, prosperous, and peaceful OSCE region. The proclamation urges all signatory states to renew their commitment to the principles established in the Helsinki Final Act.
