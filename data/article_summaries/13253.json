President Obama will be visiting the Republic of Estonia in September to strengthen the relationship between the two countries and show America's commitment to its Baltic allies. During his visit, he will meet with President Ilves and Prime Minister Roivas to discuss bilateral ties, strategic cooperation, and the trans-Atlantic partnership. He will also meet with the presidents of Latvia and Lithuania to discuss regional security and economic growth. The trip is an opportunity to reaffirm the United States' commitment to Article V, the foundation of NATO, in light of recent developments in Ukraine.
