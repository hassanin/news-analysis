President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to modernize sanctions aimed at combating terrorism. The order consolidates and strengthens sanctions to address acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism by foreign terrorists. It builds upon previous executive orders and deals with the continuing and immediate threat of terrorism, including acts that jeopardize the Middle East peace process. The order terminates a national emergency declared in 1995 and revokes previous executive orders.
