President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of California and has ordered Federal assistance to support State and local recovery efforts in areas affected by wildfires since December 4, 2017. Federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. William Roche has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments are completed.
