President Biden announced the protection and expansion of three national monuments: Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah, and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument off the coast of New England. The previous administration had reduced the size of these monuments, but President Biden is restoring their boundaries and protections. He emphasized the importance of preserving public lands and the need to address climate change. President Biden also mentioned his plans to achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and create a Civilian Climate Corps. Additionally, he highlighted the protection of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska and opposition to mining in Bristol Bay and oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The President signed proclamations to formalize these actions.
