The Biden Administration is taking three new actions to prevent suicide, with a focus on promoting safe firearms storage and clarifying best practices for firearms dealers. Firearms are the most common method of suicide in the United States, accounting for two-thirds of all firearms deaths. Studies have shown that reducing access to lethal means, such as firearms, can save lives. Keeping firearms locked or unloaded can reduce the risk of firearm-related suicide. The comprehensive military and veteran suicide prevention strategy will include a focus on improving lethal means safety. The Department of Justice plans to finalize a rule that clarifies firearms dealers' obligations to make secure gun storage or safety devices available for purchase. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will issue a best practices guide to federal firearms dealers to ensure they are taking the necessary steps to keep customers and communities safe. These actions build on the Administration's previous gun violence prevention efforts, including model legislation for extreme risk protection orders. The President is also urging Congress to pass national "red flag" laws and incentivize states to pass their own versions of these laws.
