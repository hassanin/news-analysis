President Biden's Investing in America agenda, signed into law in 2021 and 2022, includes strategic public investments in industries crucial for long-term economic growth in the US, with a focus on reducing carbon emissions. The agenda includes incentives for manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, investments in demonstration projects, and tax credits for clean energy generation. Private companies have responded to these incentives, announcing over half a trillion dollars in new investments, particularly in clean energy manufacturing, electric vehicles (EVs), and power generation. Construction spending on manufacturing facilities has nearly doubled since Biden took office, exceeding expectations. The agenda has also spurred private deployment of clean energy technologies, such as solar and wind manufacturing capacity, battery energy storage, and EV sales. The expansion of clean energy technologies contributes to the Biden administration's climate goals, lowering emissions, improving energy security, and promoting economic growth. The investments are expected to have long-term benefits, including improved energy reliability, lower energy prices, and GDP growth. The latest data show that the agenda is already generating economic and environmental benefits, and forecasts suggest that it is mobilizing more activity than anticipated, bringing the US closer to its clean energy goals.
