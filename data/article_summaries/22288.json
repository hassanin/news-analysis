President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring January 16, 2015, as Religious Freedom Day in the United States. The proclamation highlights the significance of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, adopted on January 16, 1786, which codified the right of every person to freely express their religious beliefs. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of religious freedom in American society, stating that it allows faith to flourish and contributes to a stronger nation. It also acknowledges the need to protect religious freedom globally, as millions of individuals face discrimination and abuse for practicing their religion or choosing not to claim a faith. The proclamation calls on all Americans to commemorate Religious Freedom Day and work towards safeguarding this fundamental liberty for future generations.
