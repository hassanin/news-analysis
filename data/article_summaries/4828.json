President Biden has announced his intent to nominate two individuals to federal circuit courts and two individuals to federal district courts. These nominees are highly qualified, experienced, and committed to upholding the rule of law and the Constitution. The President's choices also reflect his commitment to diversity in the courts, both in terms of personal and professional backgrounds.

If confirmed, this slate of nominees would include the first Hispanic person to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. These nominations bring the total number of announced federal judicial nominees by President Biden to 180.

The nominees for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit are Judge Joshua P. Kolar and Richard E. N. Federico. Judge Kolar has been a United States Magistrate Judge on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana since 2019 and also serves as a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve. Richard Federico is currently a Senior Litigator at the Federal Public Defender for the District of Kansas and also serves as a Captain in the United States Navy Reserve.

The nominees for the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota and the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California are Judge Jeffrey Bryan and Judge Eumi K. Lee, respectively. Judge Bryan has been serving as a judge on the Minnesota Court of Appeals since 2019, and Judge Lee has been a judge on the Superior Court of California in Alameda County since 2018.

Overall, these nominations demonstrate President Biden's commitment to selecting qualified and diverse candidates for federal judicial positions.
