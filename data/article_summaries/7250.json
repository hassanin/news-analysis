President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Montana and authorized federal assistance to aid in the recovery efforts for areas affected by the Richard Spring Fire. The declaration makes federal funding available to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding. Alana B. Kuhn has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, with additional designations possible in the future. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
