Nearly 200 countries have reached an agreement to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), potent greenhouse gases, at the 28th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in Kigali, Rwanda. The agreement commits countries to cut the production and consumption of HFCs by over 80% in the next 30 years. This deal is expected to avoid over 80 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050 and could prevent up to 0.5°C of warming by the end of the century. The agreement is considered a significant contribution to achieving the goal of limiting global temperature rise to below 2°C, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. The Montreal Protocol, which aims to protect the ozone layer, will be amended to address HFCs, which were used as replacements for ozone-depleting substances. HFCs can be hundreds to thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide in contributing to climate change. The agreement includes an innovative and flexible structure, an ambitious phasedown schedule, incentives for earlier action, broad participation, enforcement and accountability measures, and multiple opportunities to increase ambition. The United States has already taken action domestically to address HFCs, including prohibiting the use of certain HFCs and expanding options for climate-friendly alternatives. Private-sector commitments and executive actions in the US are expected to reduce global consumption of HFCs by over 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent through 2025.
