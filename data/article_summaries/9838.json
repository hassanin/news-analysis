The United States has successfully removed 128 kilograms (over 280 pounds) of highly enriched uranium (HEU) from two sites in Ukraine. This removal was part of a joint effort between the US and Ukraine and fulfills the commitments made by Presidents Obama and Yanukovych at the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit. The operation required six different secure operations and cooperation among the US, Ukraine, Russia, and the IAEA to remove a total of 234 kilograms of HEU over a two-year period. The HEU was returned to Russia to be downblended into low enriched uranium (LEU), which cannot be used to make nuclear weapons. In exchange for the removal, the US provided Ukraine with replacement LEU fuel and a Neutron Source Facility (NSF) at the Kharkiv Institute for Physics and Technology. The US has already shipped replacement LEU and completed the main stages of construction for the NSF, which will be fully operational by 2014. The NSF will provide Ukraine with new research capabilities and the ability to produce various industrial and medical isotopes. The removal of HEU from civilian sites like these contributes to permanent threat reduction. Financial support for the removal operations was provided by the United Kingdom.
