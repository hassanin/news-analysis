In this statement, President Obama discusses two milestones that have recently occurred. The first milestone is the historic vote by the House of Representatives on health insurance reform. The President emphasizes that this legislation will provide stability and security for those with insurance, affordable options for those without insurance, and reduce the cost of healthcare. He also mentions that the bill is fully paid for and will reduce the long-term federal deficit. The President acknowledges the courage of the members of Congress who voted for the bill and highlights the positive impact it will have on millions of Americans, such as those with preexisting conditions and small businesses. He shares the story of a cancer survivor who had her insurance revoked and assures her that this legislation will protect Americans from insurance company abuses. The President urges the United States Senate to continue the effort to pass comprehensive health insurance reform. The second milestone mentioned is the approval of a new election law in Iraq, which paves the way for national elections early next year. The President congratulates Iraq's leaders for reaching this agreement and expresses his confidence in Iraq's democracy and national unity. He acknowledges the challenges that Iraq still faces but believes that this agreement is a step forward in achieving lasting peace and unity in the country. The President concludes by thanking the troops and civilians serving in Iraq and looking forward to the upcoming Iraqi elections.
