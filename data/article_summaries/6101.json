The 12th meeting of the National Climate Task Force was held to discuss President Biden's commitment to protecting vulnerable Americans from extreme heat, strengthening resilience to extreme weather, and lowering energy costs. The Task Force received a science briefing on the forecasted extreme heat, drought, wildfires, and flood risk in the country. They discussed the disproportionate impact of these climate and weather extremes on disadvantaged communities and the actions being taken to address them. These actions include weatherizing homes, updating building codes, setting flood-risk reduction standards, protecting workers from extreme heat exposure, increasing firefighters' pay, and accelerating clean energy projects. The Task Force also discussed leveraging domestic climate action to spur international efforts. The Task Force is chaired by the National Climate Advisor and includes leaders from over 25 federal agencies.
