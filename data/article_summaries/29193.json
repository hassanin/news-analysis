During a press briefing at the White House, Ambassador Ric Grenell, National Security Advisor Robert Oâ€™Brien, and Senior Advisor Jared Kushner discussed the historic agreement between Serbia and Kosovo to normalize their economic relations. The agreement, which was facilitated by the Trump administration, aims to break the deadlock that has persisted between the two countries for decades. It includes the establishment of diplomatic relations between Kosovo and Israel, marking the second time in less than a month that Israel has normalized ties with a majority-Muslim country. The officials emphasized that these agreements could only happen under the leadership of President Trump and his "peace through strength" foreign policy approach. They also addressed questions about foreign interference in the upcoming election, particularly from China and Russia, and defended the President's commitment to the military and veterans in light of recent reports.
