The article discusses the successful conclusion of the Seventh Review Conference of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC). The conference endorsed a work program for the next five years that aims to reduce biological threats and advance objectives set forth in President Obama's National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats. The program focuses on strengthening national implementation of the BWC, science and technology developments relevant to the treaty, and cooperation and assistance to build global capacities for preventing and controlling disease outbreaks. The conference also emphasized the need for regular review of scientific and technological developments, building capacity to deal with disease outbreaks, and enhancing participation in voluntary confidence-building measures. The United States proposed the creation of a Bio-Transparency and Openness Initiative to demonstrate confidence in compliance and announced plans for an International Forum on Health and Security in 2012.
