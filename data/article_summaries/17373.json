In this article, President Obama emphasizes the importance of reforming Wall Street after the economic crisis. He states that the current bill in Congress will put an end to financial bailouts, hold Wall Street accountable, and protect consumers, taxpayers, and the economy from abuses that contributed to the crisis. Obama believes that without this reform, the abuses and the system that allows them to continue will persist. He highlights the need for consumer protection, transparency in financial transactions, closing legal loopholes, and holding big banks accountable for their decisions. Obama acknowledges opposition from special interests and their allies in Washington who have worked to weaken the bill. He urges Democrats and Republicans to put aside politics and work together for the sake of financial reform, as the cost of inaction is too high. Obama concludes by expressing his determination to make Wall Street take responsibility and give consumers more control in the financial system.
