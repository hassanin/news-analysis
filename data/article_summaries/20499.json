The United States and Canada have welcomed the announcement that Canada will be incorporated into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations. The TPP is a regional agreement aimed at liberalizing trade and investment and addressing new and traditional trade issues. Both countries have a strong trade relationship, with Canada being the top export destination for U.S. goods and services. The TPP is seen as an opportunity to further strengthen this trading relationship and create new opportunities for businesses across the Asia-Pacific region. The United States and Canada have been partners in free trade since 1988 and have also collaborated on initiatives such as the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement and the Action Plan on Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness. The TPP is seen as a chance to build on the commitments of NAFTA and create a high-standard agreement.
