The United States and Chile have a strong commitment to expanding economic growth and job creation through integration into global markets. Since the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA) entered into force in 2004, bilateral merchandise trade has grown by 340 percent. U.S. exports to Chile increased by nearly 600 percent between 2003 and 2012, and U.S. imports from Chile grew by 153 percent during the same period. The United States is Chile's second largest export market and primary supplier of imports. U.S. small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a significant role in the U.S.-Chile trade relationship. The United States and Chile are also actively engaged in negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a high-standard trade agreement. Both countries are working together to promote lower carbon economic growth, expand cooperation on clean energy, and regional electrical interconnection. Chile aims to obtain 10% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2024. The United States is committed to working with Chile to meet its energy needs and facilitate continued economic growth.
