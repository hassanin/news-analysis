On December 10, 2020, the United States issued a proclamation expressing its support for Morocco's autonomy proposal as the only basis for a just and lasting solution to the dispute over the Western Sahara territory. The proclamation recognizes Moroccan sovereignty over the entire Western Sahara territory and reaffirms the United States' support for Morocco's autonomy proposal. It states that an independent Sahrawi State is not a realistic option and that genuine autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the only feasible solution. The United States urges the parties to engage in discussions using Morocco's autonomy plan as the framework for negotiation. Additionally, the United States plans to open a consulate in the Western Sahara territory, specifically in Dakhla, to promote economic and business opportunities in the region. The proclamation is signed by President Donald J. Trump.
