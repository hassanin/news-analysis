The Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to address teacher shortages and strengthen the teaching profession as the new school year begins. This includes commitments from job platforms to make it easier for Americans to find opportunities in education, initiatives from teachers unions and organizations to expand pathways into the profession, and efforts to improve working conditions for staff and learning conditions for students. The American Rescue Plan has provided funding to invest in teacher pipeline programs, increase compensation, and hire more professionals in the education workforce. Leading talent recruitment platforms are also announcing actions to help school districts source and hire teachers and school professionals. The Department of Education and the Department of Labor have issued a joint letter encouraging actions to address shortages and invest in the teaching profession. National teacher unions and state organizations are working together to expand high-quality teacher apprenticeship programs and other pathways. The White House is also holding a Public Service Loan Forgiveness Day of Action to ensure that teachers and school staff can access loan forgiveness they are eligible for.
