President Joe Biden has issued an executive order to protect and strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and make high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable for all Americans. The order acknowledges the success of the ACA in reducing the number of uninsured Americans and extending consumer protections, but also recognizes that millions of potentially eligible people remain uninsured. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the need for accessible healthcare, with millions of Americans contracting the disease and many remaining uninsured. The order calls for the consideration of a Special Enrollment Period for uninsured and under-insured Americans to seek coverage through the Federally Facilitated Marketplace. It also mandates an immediate review of existing agency actions to ensure consistency with the policy set forth in the order, including examining policies that may undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, reduce coverage under Medicaid or the ACA, undermine health insurance markets, create barriers to access, or reduce affordability of coverage. The order revokes previous executive orders that aimed to minimize the economic burden of the ACA and promote healthcare choice and competition. It concludes by stating that the order does not impair existing authorities or functions of executive departments or agencies and should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
