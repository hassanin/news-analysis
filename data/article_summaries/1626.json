Today, top White House officials, including Tom Perez, Stefanie Feldman, Gregory Jackson, and Rob Wilcox, met with Lieutenant Governors to discuss gun violence prevention efforts. The meeting highlights the Biden-Harris Administration's dedication to reducing gun violence. Last month, President Biden established the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, led by Vice President Harris, to implement and expand on executive and legislative actions taken to save lives. The Office continues to build on historic actions, such as signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant legislation on gun violence in three decades. During the meeting, officials and Lieutenant Governors discussed ways to partner in enacting policies to prevent gun violence and the available federal resources to address gun and violent crimes. The meeting also aimed to strengthen federal and state collaborations on gun violence prevention.
