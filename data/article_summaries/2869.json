Officials from the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, Domestic Policy Council, and the Department of Health and Human Services recently held a meeting with bipartisan state legislative leaders to discuss mental health crisis and suicide prevention efforts. Suicide remains a leading cause of death in the United States, with over 45,000 individuals losing their lives to it in 2020. The Biden-Harris Administration has made significant investments in suicide prevention and care, aiming to provide Americans with the necessary support and resources for their mental health. In May 2022, they released a comprehensive strategy that focuses on strengthening community-based crisis response, training and recruiting behavioral health professionals, investing in prevention and research, and improving the capacity of long-term care facilities to deliver behavioral health care. The administration has allocated $432 million to help states transition to the new "988" crisis response line, which will provide access to trained crisis counselors through phone, chat, and text. During the meeting, state legislative leaders discussed their efforts in funding "988" services, addressing mental health workforce shortages, increasing accessibility to in-person and telehealth services, and ensuring behavioral health services for individuals in the criminal justice system. The White House officials expressed gratitude for their ongoing partnership and efforts in addressing the mental health crisis.
