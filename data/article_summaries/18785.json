On January 26, 2009, the White House issued a memorandum regarding the State of California's request for a waiver under the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to set emissions standards for new motor vehicles. However, California is allowed to adopt its own standards if the EPA grants a waiver based on certain criteria. Other states can also adopt California's standards if a waiver has been granted and they meet the necessary criteria.

The EPA had previously denied California's application for a waiver to adopt limitations on greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles. In this memorandum, the White House requests the EPA to assess whether the denial of the waiver was appropriate according to the Clean Air Act. Based on this assessment, the EPA is asked to take any necessary action.

It is important to note that this memorandum does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. The memorandum also authorizes the publication of this document in the Federal Register.
