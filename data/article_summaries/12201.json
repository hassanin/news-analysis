The White House has announced that the fourth and final Nuclear Security Summit will be held on March 31 to April 1, 2016, in Washington, D.C. The summit aims to address the immediate and extreme threat of nuclear terrorism and discuss steps to minimize the use of highly-enriched uranium, secure vulnerable materials, counter nuclear smuggling, and deter attempts at nuclear terrorism. The United States seeks a strengthened global nuclear security architecture based on international standards and aims to reduce global stocks of nuclear weapons-usable materials. The summit builds on previous summits held in Washington, D.C. in 2010, Seoul in 2012, and The Hague in 2014, which achieved improvements in nuclear security. The statement emphasizes the urgency of working together to raise standards for nuclear security before an act of nuclear terrorism occurs.
