The article discusses the launch of the second Promise Zone competition by the Obama Administration. Promise Zones are part of the President's plan to create economic opportunity in high-poverty communities by partnering with local communities and businesses to create jobs, improve education, increase economic security, and reduce crime. The first five Promise Zones have already seen positive results, such as increased graduation rates and job connections. The new competition will invite urban, rural, and tribal communities to submit plans for partnership with the federal government and access to federal investments. Promise Zones will receive federal support, including full-time AmeriCorps VISTA members, to implement their goals. Communities meeting the qualifying criteria can apply, regardless of previous federal grants. The deadline for applications is November 21, 2014. The article also highlights the progress made in the first five Promise Zones, including improved education, job opportunities, and investments in infrastructure.
