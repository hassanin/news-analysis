President Biden signed the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022 into law. This bipartisan legislation, passed as part of the Omnibus appropriations package, strengthens the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) that was first passed in 1994. President Biden has been a strong advocate against abuses of power and has worked throughout his career to address gender-based violence. The 2022 reauthorization of VAWA expands access to safety and support for survivors and increases prevention efforts. The Biden-Harris Administration has also taken significant steps to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, including the creation of the White House Gender Policy Council and the development of a National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence. These efforts aim to create a society where survivors are supported and all people can live free from abuse.
