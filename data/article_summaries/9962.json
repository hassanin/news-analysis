On April 8, 2009, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13507, which established the White House Office of Health Reform. The purpose of this office was to provide leadership and coordination in improving access to affordable and high-quality healthcare for all Americans. The order acknowledged the problems within the healthcare system, such as rising costs and inconsistent quality of care, and aimed to address these issues. The Health Reform Office was tasked with developing the administration's policy agenda, coordinating with other executive departments and agencies, integrating the president's policy agenda across the federal government, coordinating public outreach activities, and working with state and local policymakers to expand coverage and improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. The office was also responsible for developing and implementing strategic initiatives, monitoring the implementation of the president's healthcare agenda, and ensuring that policymakers across the executive branch aligned with the president's goals. The Health Reform Office had a staff headed by a director and worked with various committees and task forces. All executive departments and agencies were required to cooperate with the office and provide necessary support and information, within the limits of the law. The executive order emphasized that it did not affect the authority of other departments or the Office of Management and Budget, and it was subject to applicable laws and appropriations.
