On César Chávez Day, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. pays tribute to the legacy of César E. Chávez, a prominent activist who fought for the rights and dignity of working people. Chávez witnessed an economy that favored the wealthy while leaving millions of hardworking Americans behind. His courage and moral clarity serve as inspiration as the nation faces challenges such as the pandemic, economic inequality, and racial and economic justice. Chávez's work as the founder of the United Farm Workers of America highlights the importance of organizing and collective bargaining in advancing the wellbeing of working Americans. He believed in building an economy that includes the aspirations and needs of others. Chávez's advocacy for safe and healthy workplaces, a living wage, and time with family remains relevant today. President Biden emphasizes the importance of remembering Chávez's teachings and working towards equity and justice in our communities. He declares March 31, 2021, as César Chávez Day and encourages Americans to observe it as a day of service and learning to honor Chávez's enduring legacy.
