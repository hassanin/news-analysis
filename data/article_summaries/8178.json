Vice President Harris will announce the arrival of over 14,000 pounds of Kendamil infant formula at Dulles International Airport. This is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's Operation Fly Formula, a multi-agency partnership that aims to ship infant formula to store shelves faster. By the end of this week, Operation Fly Formula will have delivered the equivalent of 13 million 8-ounce bottles of formula. The shipment announced by the Vice President was donated by United Airlines and is one of ten international shipments facilitated through Operation Fly Formula for the week of June 13th. The Biden-Harris Administration is taking additional actions to increase the supply of infant formula and get it back on shelves quickly and safely. Various government departments, including the FDA, HHS, USDA, DOJ, DOT, USTR, DHS, DOC, DoD, and the White House, have been working together to address the shortfall in infant formula production. These actions build upon earlier efforts by the FDA and USDA to address the formula shortage.
