President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans, which was declared in Executive Order 13219 in 2001, is to continue beyond June 26, 2018. The threat posed by extremist violence and acts obstructing the implementation of agreements in the Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia, and Kosovo has not been resolved. These actions are considered hostile to US interests and continue to pose a threat to national security and foreign policy. Therefore, the President has determined it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans.
