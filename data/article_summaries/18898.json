The article discusses the approval of a border security law in the Southwest by President Obama. The President emphasizes that border security has been one of his top priorities and his administration has dedicated unprecedented resources and personnel to combat transnational criminal organizations involved in drug and human trafficking. The law responds to the President's call to enhance collaboration between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. It provides $600 million in additional funding for technology improvements, information sharing, and support for law enforcement agencies. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice will receive funds for hiring new personnel, increasing the presence of border patrol agents and investigators, and supporting operations along the border. The law also authorizes the mobilization of up to 1,200 National Guard troops to assist with intelligence, surveillance, and drug enforcement operations. The Obama administration has already made significant efforts to secure the border, including doubling the staff of border enforcement task forces, increasing intelligence analysts focused on cartel violence, and deploying assets and personnel to the border. These efforts have resulted in increased seizures of drugs, cash, and weapons, as well as a reduction in illegal border crossings.
