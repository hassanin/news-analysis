On September 12, 2012, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation to honor the victims of the attack in Benghazi, Libya. The proclamation ordered that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff at the White House, all public buildings and grounds, military posts, naval stations, and naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset on September 16, 2012. The same directive was given for all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
