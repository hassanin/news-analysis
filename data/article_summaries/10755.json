President Obama has designated two new national monuments in Utah and Nevada, protecting sacred sites, scenic landscapes, and natural and cultural resources. The Bears Ears National Monument in Utah will protect 1.35 million acres of federal land, including ancestral grounds for tribes and important archaeological sites. It establishes a Bears Ears Commission to ensure tribal expertise and knowledge in management decisions. The Gold Butte National Monument in Nevada spans nearly 300,000 acres and protects cultural resources, geological formations, and wildlife habitat. It connects already protected lands and preserves Native American historical sites. These designations follow years of input from tribes, local officials, and stakeholders, and build on President Obama's commitment to protecting sacred sites and natural resources.
