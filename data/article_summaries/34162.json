President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump hosted a reception at the White House to honor Gold Star families and those they have lost. Gold Star families are those who have lost an immediate family member serving during wartime. Melania Trump expressed her admiration for these families and their sacrifice. Lieutenant General McMaster and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly also attended the event. Secretary Kelly, who lost his son, a U.S. Marine officer, in Afghanistan, addressed the families and asked them to stand as their service member was named. Candles were lit in remembrance of all fallen service members. The term "Gold Star family" originated during World War I, when families would fly a blue star flag for each family member serving in the armed forces, changing it to gold if they lost a loved one. The evening also included musical performances by the United States Marine Band and a military soloist.
