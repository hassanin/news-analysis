The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a statement detailing the ongoing "Recovery Summer" events and visits to Recovery Act project sites by Vice President Joe Biden and other administration officials. The Recovery Act has already funded numerous projects and provided jobs for millions of Americans. This summer, even more projects are breaking ground, creating jobs and promoting economic growth. Some highlights of the events include Vice President Biden visiting GE Consumer & Industrial in Kentucky to discuss the creation of jobs through the EnergyStar rebates and Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credits, and the Department of Transportation attending groundbreaking ceremonies for various infrastructure projects funded by the Recovery Act. Additionally, the Small Business Administration has supported small businesses with loans through the Recovery Act, and the Department of Labor has announced funds for On-the-Job Training and National Emergency Grants to help Americans get back to work.
