First Lady Michelle Obama will be celebrating Black History Month at the White House by hosting a day-long dance workshop for local students. The theme of this year's celebration is "Honoring the Past While Celebrating the Present; 7 Years of Living African American History." The workshop will feature iconic leaders in dance such as Judith Jamison, Debbie Allen, Virginia Johnson, and Fatima Robinson. These women have made significant contributions to the landscape of African American women and girls in dance. In the afternoon, there will be a panel discussion where the First Lady and the panelists will answer questions from students on topics like self-confidence, health, hard work, and overcoming adversity. Later in the evening, the First Lady will deliver remarks and introduce a student presentation where young dancers will tell the story of African American history and culture through dance.
