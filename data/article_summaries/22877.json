The President released a statement praising the passage of the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act in the House of Representatives. This bipartisan legislation aims to save taxpayer dollars by reducing wasteful overpayments made by the federal government. The bill establishes stricter thresholds for program payment errors and expands the authority of federal agencies to use private sector auditors to identify and recover government overpayments. It also enhances transparency and accountability in government spending. The President believes that it is crucial to be responsible stewards of taxpayers' money and has taken measures to curb improper payments, including issuing an Executive Order and calling for tough audits. The President hopes that the Senate will quickly pass the bill and send it to his desk for approval.
