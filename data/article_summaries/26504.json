The US Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued a warning to US financial institutions about the possibility of senior foreign political figures connected to the Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega attempting to transfer proceeds from acts of political corruption into the US financial system. The advisory serves as a strong signal that the Trump administration will not tolerate the Ortega regime's use of violence, repression, and corruption, which have negatively impacted Nicaragua's economy. The US is calling for the peaceful restoration of democracy and the rule of law in Nicaragua as a means to achieve long-term economic stability.
