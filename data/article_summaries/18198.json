Assistant to the President John Brennan called President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen to encourage him to sign and implement the Gulf Cooperation Council-brokered agreement. Brennan emphasized that this transfer of power is crucial for Yemen's stability, unity, and prosperity, as well as for the Yemeni people's desire for peace and political reform. The United States reiterated its commitment to supporting Yemen in implementing the agreement, promoting economic development, and combating the security threat from al-Qaâ€™ida in the Arabian Peninsula. Brennan also emphasized the importance of a peaceful and orderly transition without violence.
