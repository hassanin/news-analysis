Valerie Jarrett, Senior Advisor to the President, held a call with thousands of Americans who signed a We the People petition supporting a ban on assault weapons. Jarrett reiterated the President and Vice President's support for reinstating the ban on assault weapons that expired over a decade ago. She commended Congress for taking crucial votes on gun violence prevention measures, including preventing suspected terrorists from buying guns and expanding background checks. Jarrett called on Congress to pass this legislation before their next recess and emphasized the importance of making voices heard to address the issue of gun violence in the country.
