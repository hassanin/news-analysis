On April 12, 2010, President Trump declared a national emergency in response to the security situation and violence in Somalia, including acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea. This emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In 2012, additional steps were taken to address the situation, including the exports of charcoal from Somalia, the misappropriation of Somali public assets, and acts of violence against civilians. The national emergency and measures taken to address it will continue beyond April 12, 2020, for another year. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
