President Obama will be traveling to Indianapolis to discuss his plan to protect consumers against rising oil prices, decrease oil imports, and ensure a cleaner and more secure energy future. He will be touring the facilities of Allison Transmission, a leader in hybrid technology and the world's largest manufacturer of fully-automatic transmissions for commercial vehicles and hybrid-propulsion systems. Allison Transmission recently dedicated a new hybrid facility, which will have the capacity to produce 20,000 commercial-duty hybrid propulsion systems annually. The President aims to reduce America's daily oil imports from 11 million barrels to one-third of that amount by 2025, through a combination of domestic oil production, cleaner fuels, and greater efficiency. As part of this strategy, he recently unveiled the National Clean Fleet Partnership, which will assist large companies in reducing their fleets' diesel and gasoline use by incorporating electric vehicles, alternative fuels, and fuel-saving measures.
