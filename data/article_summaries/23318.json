The White House released a report highlighting the burden of health insurance premium increases on American families. According to the report, health insurance premiums in states have increased between 90-150% over the last decade, which is much faster than wages and inflation. The national average annual family premium for employer-sponsored health insurance rose to $13,375 in 2009, a 5.5% increase during a recession when inflation actually fell by 0.7%. Vice President Biden emphasized the need for nationwide reform in light of these rising premiums.
