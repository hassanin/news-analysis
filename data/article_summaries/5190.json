The Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, has designated Venezuela for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, until September 2022. This allows Venezuelan nationals currently residing in the United States to apply for TPS and employment authorization documents. The designation is a response to the extraordinary and temporary conditions in Venezuela, including a humanitarian crisis marked by hunger, malnutrition, armed groups, repression, and crumbling infrastructure. Only individuals who can demonstrate continuous residence in the United States as of March 8, 2021 are eligible for TPS under Venezuela's designation. The application must be filed within the 180-day registration period, and individuals should be cautious of false claims that the border is open due to travel and admission restrictions in place because of the pandemic.
