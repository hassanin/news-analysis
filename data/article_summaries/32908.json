The U.S. economy grew at a rapid rate of 3.1 percent in 2018, the fastest pace since 2005. This growth exceeded consensus forecasts and matched the Administration's own forecast. Gross private domestic investment played a significant role in this growth, accounting for 36 percent of the increase in real GDP. Investment in intellectual property products grew at its fastest pace since 1999. This economic performance was a marked acceleration from the previous expansion period. The growth rate of real GDP from 2009 to 2016 was 2.2 percent, but it increased to 3.1 percent in 2018. The growth in 2018 was $280 billion larger than if the pre-2017 trend had continued. This performance is consistent with the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The U.S. economy has exceeded consensus forecasts for two consecutive years. Real GDP growth under the Trump Administration has been 2.9 percent over 7 quarters, compared to 2.3 percent in the preceding 4-year Presidential term.
