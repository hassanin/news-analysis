All three leading insulin producers in America have agreed to reduce their prices, following calls to expand the $35 cap for seniors to all Americans. Sanofi is the latest company to recognize that charging hundreds of dollars for insulin, which only costs $10 to produce, is unjust. The administration is working to provide more breathing room for working people and families, and legislation should be passed to ensure everyone can get insulin for no more than $35 per month. The article also mentions the need for a Junk Fee Prevention Act and legislation to make childcare more affordable and accessible. However, the Inflation Reduction Act should not be repealed, as it would result in major Medicare benefit cuts and increased costs for prescription drugs, health coverage, and home energy. If Congress does not cooperate, the administration will continue to take action independently to provide relief on insulin costs. Despite challenges, the author remains optimistic about America's future.
