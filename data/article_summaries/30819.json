The Bureau of Economic Analysis has released its advance estimate of U.S. GDP for the second quarter of 2020, showing that real GDP contracted at an annualized rate of -32.9 percent, the largest quarterly decline since 1947. Despite this massive contraction, the U.S. economy was in a healthier and more resilient position compared to previous crises, such as the Financial Crisis of 2008-09. Prior to the pandemic, American households had a smaller overall debt burden, and the United States had the highest growth rate among G7 countries. The decline in GDP was widespread, with consumer spending being the biggest contributor to the decline. The pandemic led to a drop in real personal income, but the fiscal response by the Federal Government, including expanding unemployment insurance and economic recovery rebates, helped mitigate the impact. Some economic activity has already resumed as the country reopened, with retail sales and industrial production experiencing a rebound in May and June. The forecast is for strong real GDP growth in the third quarter. Recent economic data releases have exceeded expectations, providing optimism for the future. However, the magnitude of the contraction reflects the sacrifices made to slow the spread of COVID-19. The Trump Administration will continue to support the country as it navigates through this crisis.
