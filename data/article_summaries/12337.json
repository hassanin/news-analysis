This article is a statement from the President on the 45th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. The President acknowledges the historic significance of the legislation and its role in moving America closer to the dream of opportunity, equality, and justice for all. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended legal discrimination and ensured equal justice under the law for all Americans, regardless of their gender or the color of their skin. The President emphasizes that the passage of the Civil Rights Act was made possible by the efforts of Americans from all backgrounds who stood up, sat down, and marched for freedom. While the Civil Rights Act opened doors of freedom and opportunity, the President acknowledges that there are still inequities and barriers that exist in the African-American community and across the country. The President calls for continued efforts to break down these barriers in laws, policies, and hearts, in order to fulfill the full promise of the Civil Rights Act and perfect the union that was created by the country's founders.
