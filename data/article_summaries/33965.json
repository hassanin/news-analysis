On August 1, 2019, President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order to take additional steps with respect to a national emergency described and declared in a previous executive order. The order grants the President and the Secretary of State the authority to impose sanctions on a country by opposing the extension of loans or financial assistance from international financial institutions and prohibiting US banks from making loans or providing credit to the government of that country, with exceptions for loans or credits for purchasing food or agricultural commodities. The order also prohibits any transaction or conspiracy that evades or avoids these sanctions. Additionally, the order delegates certain authorities and duties to the Secretary of the Treasury, defines terms such as "entity" and "United States bank," and authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to take necessary actions to implement the order. The order emphasizes that it should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
