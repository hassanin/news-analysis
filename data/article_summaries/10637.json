The Chief Economist, Jared Bernstein, has stated that it is too early to make definitive conclusions about the impact of the Recovery Act based on the partial and preliminary data available. However, the initial indications are positive. The data reports on $16 billion of the $339 billion spent on Recovery Act efforts before September 30th. The number of jobs created or saved by recipients of the Recovery Act exceeds projections. Both private estimates and this limited data suggest that the Recovery Act has created or saved approximately 1 million jobs in its first seven months. This is seen as a significant boost for the economy during a challenging period. A more comprehensive report is expected on October 30th.
