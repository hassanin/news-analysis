Vice President Kamala Harris joined a virtual meeting with leaders and canvassers to express her gratitude for their work in mobilizing voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona. She acknowledged their efforts in helping Joe Biden become President and herself become Vice President. Harris emphasized the importance of reminding people of their power and not letting anyone take it away. She criticized the Republican Party for defining strength through division and beating down others, while Democrats stand for unity and lifting people up. Harris highlighted the accomplishments of the Biden-Harris administration, such as reducing child poverty, providing financial support for parents, capping the cost of insulin, and tackling climate change. She also addressed concerns about the potential loss of women's rights under Roe v. Wade and encouraged young women to keep fighting for their rights and to recognize their power in effecting change.
