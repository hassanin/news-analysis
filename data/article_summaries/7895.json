The Biden-Harris Administration is releasing a new Permitting Action Plan to strengthen and accelerate Federal permitting and environmental reviews in order to make the most of the historic investments in infrastructure outlined in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Action Plan focuses on ensuring that the permitting processes are effective, efficient, and transparent, guided by the best available science and shaped by early and meaningful public engagement. The plan aims to strengthen supply chains, lower costs for families, grow the clean energy economy, revitalize communities, support good-paying jobs, and deliver infrastructure investments on time and on budget. It includes five key elements: accelerating smart permitting through early cross-agency coordination, establishing clear timeline goals and tracking key project information, engaging in early and meaningful outreach with stakeholders, improving agency responsiveness, technical assistance, and support, and using agency resources and environmental reviews to improve impact. The Action Plan aims to deliver the benefits of infrastructure investment to the American people and support the President's climate and clean energy goals.
