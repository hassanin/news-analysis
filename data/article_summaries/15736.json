President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Indiana, ordering federal aid to supplement recovery efforts after a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in January 2014. The federal funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Boone, Clay, Hendricks, Huntington, Jasper, Kosciusko, Madison, Morgan, Newton, Noble, Owen, Parke, Putnam, Sullivan, Tipton, Vigo, Wabash, White, and Whitley. Additionally, federal funding will be provided for snow assistance and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed David G. Samaniego as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Further designations may be made if requested by the state and further damage assessments warrant it.
