President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation suspending the application of duty-free treatment for all AGOA-eligible goods in the agricultural sector from South Africa, effective March 15, 2016. This action is taken because South Africa is not meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974. The President has determined that suspending duty-free treatment would be more effective in promoting compliance by South Africa with these requirements than terminating its designation as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States will be modified to reflect this suspension. Any previous proclamations or Executive Orders that are inconsistent with this action are superseded.
