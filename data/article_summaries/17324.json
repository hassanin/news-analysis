In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims November 2014 as National Adoption Month. He acknowledges the efforts of adoptive parents who provide supportive and loving families for children. While over 500,000 children have been adopted in the past decade, there are still many children waiting for permanent homes. The article mentions National Adoption Day, which is observed on the Saturday before Thanksgiving and aims to finalize adoptions and raise awareness about children still in need of homes. The Obama Administration is investing in programs to reduce the wait time for adoption and educate adoptive families about the diverse needs of children. They are also providing mental health services to children in foster care and promoting efforts to keep siblings together. Additionally, the Adoption Tax Credit has been permanently extended to provide relief to adoptive families. The President emphasizes the importance of supporting policies that remove barriers to adoption and increase opportunities for all capable and loving caregivers, regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation, or marital status. Throughout November, the article encourages recognition of parents and professionals involved in adoption and urges the commitment to provide every child with the chance to reach their dreams.
