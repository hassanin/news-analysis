President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring October 11, 2009, as General Pulaski Memorial Day in honor of General Casimir Pulaski, a Polish-American patriot who fought for the freedom of the United States during the struggle for independence. The proclamation highlights Pulaski's heroic leadership and ultimate sacrifice in service to the country. Pulaski, born in Poland in 1745, joined the fight for Polish independence in 1768 and later learned of America's quest for independence while in Paris. He arrived in America in 1777 and quickly earned a commission, becoming known as the "Father of the American Cavalry." Pulaski was mortally wounded in 1779 during the siege of Savannah while trying to rally his troops. The proclamation recognizes the contributions of Polish Americans to the national identity of the United States and encourages Americans to commemorate General Pulaski and honor all those who defend the freedom of the nation.
