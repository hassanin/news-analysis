The White House gardens have a long history and are open for tours twice a year during the spring and fall. The land surrounding the White House was originally marshland, but has been transformed into gardens over the years. Presidents like Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, and James Monroe made significant improvements to the gardens. The gardens include features like the East Garden, also known as the First Lady's Garden, which was designed by Beatrix Farrand. The famous Rose Garden was redesigned by Rachel Lambert Mellon during President John F. Kennedy's time in office. The gardens also include a Kitchen Garden that was first planted by President John Adams and has been revived in recent years by First Lady Michelle Obama. The White House gardens are a popular attraction for visitors and hold historical significance as they have been walked upon by every American President since John Adams.
