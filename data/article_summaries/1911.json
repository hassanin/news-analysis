President Biden has added three new advisors to assist with the nomination and confirmation process for the Supreme Court. These advisors include Doug Jones, a former United States Senator from Alabama, who will provide guidance on navigating the Senate confirmation process. Jones is known for his bipartisan work and his prosecution of two Ku Klux Klan members involved in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing. Minyon Moore, a public affairs strategist, has been appointed to mobilize a nationwide engagement effort focused on confirmation. She has experience in building coalitions and engaging with public policy goals. Ben LaBolt, a communications strategist, will advise President Biden on messaging and communications regarding the confirmation process. LaBolt has extensive experience in advising elected officials and campaigns and previously served as the national press secretary for President Obama's re-election campaign. These advisors will join the existing White House officials who are already advising the President on the Supreme Court selection.
