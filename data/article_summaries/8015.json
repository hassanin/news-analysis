The Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, held productive meetings with leaders from the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Egypt to discuss the situation in Gaza. She also spoke with the Amir of Qatar to discuss developments in Gaza and accelerate planning for post-conflict efforts. Harris emphasized that Israel has the right to defend itself and that the United States supports Israel's legitimate military objectives to eliminate the threat of Hamas. However, she also expressed concern about the civilian suffering in Gaza and called on Israel to do more to protect innocent civilians. Harris outlined three areas of focus for post-conflict Gaza: reconstruction, security, and governance. She emphasized the need for the international community to dedicate significant resources to support the recovery and rebuilding of Gaza. She also stressed the importance of strengthening the Palestinian Authority Security Forces and revitalizing the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza and the West Bank. Harris reiterated the commitment to a two-state solution and called for equal measures of prosperity, freedom, and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. She did not weigh in on Israel's suggestion of a buffer zone in Gaza. Harris stated that Israel must follow international humanitarian law and do more to protect innocent civilians. She acknowledged that Israel has the right to defend itself but emphasized the need to minimize harm to civilian life.
