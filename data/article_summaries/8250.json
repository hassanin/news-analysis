President Joe Biden is taking action to address the urgent issue of climate change and strengthen America's resilience to extreme weather events. He is launching a $575 million Climate Resilience Regional Challenge through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to help coastal and Great Lakes communities become more resilient. The funding will support innovative solutions such as building natural infrastructure and preparing for community-led relocation. Additionally, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is investing $2.3 billion in grid resilience across the country, with California receiving $67.4 million to modernize its electric grid. President Biden plans to bring together state, local, Tribal, and Territorial leaders for a White House Summit on Building Climate Resilient Communities later this year. The administration is committed to investing in climate resilience and adaptation through various programs, including enhancing drought resilience, combating wildfires, protecting communities from extreme heat, reducing flood risk, promoting climate-smart buildings and infrastructure, incorporating climate risk into decision-making, advancing environmental justice, supporting and learning from Tribal communities, prioritizing health and safety, and empowering communities to understand and plan for climate risk. The administration also recognizes the power of nature-based solutions in fighting climate change and plans to conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030 through the America the Beautiful Initiative.
