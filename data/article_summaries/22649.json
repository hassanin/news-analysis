On June 22, 2009, the White House announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans. This national emergency was originally declared on June 26, 2001, by President George W. Bush. It was declared pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat to national security and foreign policy posed by extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, as well as acts obstructing the implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia and UN Security Council Resolution 1244 in Kosovo. The emergency was subsequently amended in 2003. The White House determined that the actions of individuals threatening peace and international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans continued to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States. As a result, the national emergency and the measures adopted to address it were extended for one year beyond June 26, 2009. The notice of this continuation was published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
