The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes several priorities of President Donald J. Trump. These include a 3.1-percent pay raise for troops, up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave for Federal employees, benefits for survivors of deceased service members, and the establishment of the United States Space Force. The NDAA also supports the President's efforts to rebuild the military and secure the border, while rejecting attempts to limit his authorities as Commander in Chief.
