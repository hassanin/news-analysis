The FDA and CDC have recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to six reported cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot. This announcement will not have a significant impact on the vaccination plan in the United States as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine makes up less than 5 percent of the shots administered. The country has secured enough Pfizer and Moderna doses for 300 million Americans. Over the past few weeks, more than 25 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been made available each week, and this week, 28 million doses will be provided. This supply is sufficient to continue the current pace of vaccinations and meet the President's goal of 200 million shots by his 100th day in office. Efforts are underway to reschedule individuals who were scheduled for a Johnson & Johnson vaccine to receive a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine instead.
