This article is a notice from the President of the United States, Barack Obama, on the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the Russian Federation. The President issued an executive order in 2000 blocking property and interests in property of the Russian government that are in the United States or come within the United States. This was in relation to an agreement between the US and Russia regarding the disposition of highly enriched uranium extracted from nuclear weapons. The order invoked the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to national security and foreign policy posed by the risk of nuclear proliferation. The national emergency, which was declared in 2000, is set to continue beyond June 21, 2011, in order to provide continued protection for the property and interests in property of the Russian government that are directly related to the implementation of the agreement. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
