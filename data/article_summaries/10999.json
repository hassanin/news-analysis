This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by former President Barack Obama on January 28, 2014, titled "Retirement Savings Security." The memorandum emphasizes the importance of retirement security for all Americans and acknowledges that too few individuals have enough savings to maintain their standard of living in retirement. The memorandum directs the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a new retirement savings security that can be made available through employers to their employees. The security is intended to be focused on reaching new and small-dollar savers, with low barriers to entry and a low minimum opening amount. It should protect the principal contributed while earning interest based on yields on outstanding Treasury securities. The security should also allow savers flexibility to withdraw money in case of emergencies and keep the same Treasury security if they change jobs. Additionally, the memorandum instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to work with employers, stakeholders, and other federal agencies to develop a pilot project to make the security available through payroll deduction for easy and automatic contributions. The memorandum includes general provisions about implementation, applicable law, and the publication of the memorandum.
