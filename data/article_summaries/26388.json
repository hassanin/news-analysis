The United States has strongly condemned the Taliban's recent attacks on the Afghan people. These attacks include a bombing at an election rally in Parwan province, which killed nearly 30 civilians, as well as a suicide attack in Kabul near the Afghan Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Embassy compound, resulting in the deaths of over 20 Afghans. The President has stated that he will not engage in peace negotiations with the Taliban while they continue to carry out such attacks.
