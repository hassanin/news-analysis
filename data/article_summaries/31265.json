President Donald Trump made a statement denying any quid pro quo and expressing his desire for Ukrainian President Zelensky to do the right thing. Ambassador Gordon Sondland also testified to this in his deposition. The article argues that today's hearing was a sham and highlights that Sondland's testimony was based on his beliefs and presumptions rather than hard facts. The article claims that the Democrats' impeachment inquiry has relied on unreliable and indirect evidence and that the direct evidence presented during the hearings shows that the allegations against Trump are baseless. It emphasizes that Trump's call with Zelensky did not condition any part of the US-Ukraine relationship on a quid pro quo and that Zelensky has repeatedly stated that he was not pressured by Trump. The article criticizes the Democrats for focusing on impeachment instead of working on issues that benefit the American people.
