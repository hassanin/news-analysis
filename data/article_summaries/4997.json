Today, the National Climate Task Force, led by National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, convened to discuss strategies for reducing greenhouse gases, creating jobs, and addressing the severe drought in the western United States. The Task Force was briefed on the severity of the drought and its potential to exacerbate wildfires. In response, McCarthy requested the formation of an Interagency Working Group to address the needs of drought-affected communities and improve the nation's resilience to climate impacts. The Task Force also discussed the importance of conservation in fighting climate change and announced over $700 million in new funding for conservation initiatives. This includes investments in climate-smart agriculture, wetland conservation, and nature-based approaches to coastal resilience. The Task Force consists of Cabinet members and White House leaders from 21 federal agencies, working together to implement a whole-of-government approach to climate action.
