President Obama has declared a major disaster in Pennsylvania and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that occurred from April 25-28, 2011. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to the Commonwealth and eligible local governments for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures are also eligible for federal funding. Thomas J. McCool has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made if requested by the Commonwealth and deemed necessary based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-3272.
