President Biden has announced his intent to appoint individuals to key roles in the Roosevelt Campobello International Park Commission and the Upper Colorado River Commission.

For the Roosevelt Campobello International Park Commission, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, recently retired as CEO for Goodwill of Northern New England, will serve as a Commission Member. Margaret Jane Kravchuk, a former prosecutor and judge in Maine, will serve as an Alternate Commission Member. Donald G. Soctomah, a Tribal Historic Preservation Officer with the Passamaquoddy Tribe, will also serve as an Alternate Commission Member.

The Roosevelt Campobello International Park serves as a memorial to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and a symbol of cooperation between the U.S. and Canada. It includes the summer home of President Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on Campobello Island, New Brunswick, Canada.

For the Upper Colorado River Commission, Anne J. Castle, a senior fellow at the Getches-Wilkinson Center for Natural Resources, Energy, and the Environment at the University of Colorado Law School, will serve as the United States Commissioner. Castle previously served as the Assistant Secretary for Water and Science at the U.S. Department of the Interior and has expertise in Colorado River policy and management.

The Upper Colorado River Commission is responsible for ensuring the appropriate allocation of water from the Colorado River to the Upper Division States and compliance with the 1922 Colorado River Compact to the Lower Division States and the Republic of Mexico.

These appointments reflect President Biden's commitment to environmental stewardship and cooperation between nations and states in the management of natural resources.
