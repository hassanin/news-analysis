The White House Press Secretary issued a statement expressing deep concern over reports that unidentified portions of remains from the 9/11 attacks were disposed of in a landfill in 2001. The statement also addressed the unacceptable handling of remains at Dover Port Mortuary. The President has been briefed on an independent review of the Dover Port Mortuary and supports the Pentagon's efforts to implement necessary changes to prevent such incidents from occurring again. The statement emphasizes the United States' solemn obligation to compassionately and professionally care for fallen service members and their families, as well as those lost on 9/11.
