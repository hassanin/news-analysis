President Barack Obama signed an executive order on February 5, 2009, to establish the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. This office aims to work on behalf of Americans who are committed to improving their communities, regardless of their religious or political beliefs. It will serve as a resource for nonprofit and community organizations, both secular and faith-based, seeking to make a bigger impact in their communities and navigate government regulations. Joshua DuBois, a former associate pastor and advisor to President Obama, was appointed to lead this office. The office will focus on four key priorities, including community involvement in economic recovery, support for women and children, responsible fatherhood, and fostering interfaith dialogue globally. The office will uphold the Constitution and work with the White House Counsel and the Attorney General on legal and constitutional issues. It will also include a President's Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships composed of religious and secular leaders and scholars.
