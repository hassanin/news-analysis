One year ago, a tragic incident occurred where a gunman attacked three Asian-run businesses, resulting in the deaths of eight people, six of whom were women of Asian descent. This event highlighted the ongoing issues of racism, misogyny, and hate in the United States, as well as the problem of gun violence. In response to these senseless deaths, the Vice President and President traveled to Atlanta to meet with Asian American community leaders and learn about the fear and anguish experienced by many Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, when anti-Asian xenophobia, harassment, and violence escalated significantly. The article emphasizes that anti-Asian violence and discrimination have deep historical roots in the country, and Asian American women face the compounded harm of being targeted based on both their race and gender. The government has taken steps to address these issues, such as signing the bipartisan COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law, which provides tools and resources to prevent and respond to acts of hate. The article also highlights the need for further action, particularly from Congress, to address the gun violence epidemic. The administration remains committed to promoting safety, inclusion, and belonging for Asian Americans and reducing gun violence in communities.
