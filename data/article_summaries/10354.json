The White House has announced the launch of the Government Accountability and Transparency Board as part of the Campaign to Cut Waste. The Board will focus on rooting out misspent tax dollars and making government spending more transparent. The President has named several top watchdogs and leaders in government accountability to the board, which will be led by interim chairman Earl Devaney. The Board will develop plans to enhance transparency in federal spending and stop waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. The Board will recommend strategies to make spending data more reliable and accessible, use cutting-edge technology to crack down on fraud, and improve data systems and decision-making. The Board aims to fundamentally change how government works and ensure cost-effective and efficient execution of its vision. The Government Accountability and Transparency Board is part of the broader Campaign to Cut Waste, which aims to identify and eliminate misspent tax dollars across all federal agencies and departments.
