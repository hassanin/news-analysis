President Biden fulfilled his commitment to rejoin the Paris Agreement on Day One of his presidency. He then took executive actions to address the climate crisis, create jobs, and strengthen the economy. He held a historic summit with 40 world leaders to rally global cooperation and ambition in tackling the climate crisis. During the summit, President Biden announced that the United States will target reducing emissions by 50-52 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The Biden-Harris Administration has implemented a whole-of-government approach to unleash economic opportunities, create jobs, and advance environmental justice. The administration is working at the national and local levels to help those impacted by climate change and build a resilient and equitable future. While the United States is taking action, other countries must also step up, as more than 85 percent of emissions come from beyond U.S. borders. The United States is leading the way with bold commitments across the federal government, including enhancing climate ambition, mobilizing financing, transforming energy systems, revitalizing the transport sector, building workforces for the future, promoting innovation, providing support for vulnerable countries, implementing nature-based solutions, and promoting safety and security. President Biden is committed to working with sub-national actors, businesses, civil society, indigenous communities, and youth to address the climate crisis collectively. These actions are part of the Biden-Harris Administration's whole-of-government response to climate change, which aims to create jobs, advance environmental justice, and address the global challenge.
