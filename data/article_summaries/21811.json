The White House has released a statement regarding Israel's announcement on Gaza. The President has described the situation in Gaza as unsustainable and has emphasized the need for fundamental change. The United States has announced a commitment of $400 million for initiatives in the West Bank and Gaza as a down payment on their commitment to the people of Gaza. The new policy towards Gaza announced by the Government of Israel is welcomed by the United States and is expected to improve conditions for Palestinians in Gaza while preventing the entry of weapons. The United States will work with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, the Quartet, and other international partners to ensure the implementation of these arrangements and explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza. The President will discuss this new policy and additional steps with Prime Minister Netanyahu during his visit to Washington. The statement also reaffirms Israel's right to self-defense and calls for the immediate release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who has been in captivity for four years. The implementation of the policy announced by Israel is expected to improve the lives of the people of Gaza, and the United States will continue to support this effort. The statement urges all parties to act responsibly and deliver goods through established channels to avoid unnecessary confrontations.
