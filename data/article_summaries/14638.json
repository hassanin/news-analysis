The United States welcomes the adoption of a resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council on the elimination of discrimination against women. The resolution establishes a working group of five independent experts from different regions of the world who will collaborate with governments and civil society to identify and promote steps to eliminate laws and practices that discriminate against women. The United States, along with over 70 other countries, co-sponsored this resolution, led by Colombia and Mexico. The US is committed to working with the new working group and the international community to end discrimination against women worldwide.
