President Biden met with private sector and education leaders to discuss the urgent need to address cybersecurity threats in the United States. Recent high-profile cyber incidents have highlighted the increasing sophistication of malicious cyber activity targeting both public and private entities. These threats have wide-ranging impacts, affecting businesses of all sizes, small towns, cities, and middle-class families. The challenge is further compounded by the fact that there is a shortage of nearly half a million cybersecurity jobs in the public and private sectors.

The Biden Administration recognizes that cybersecurity is crucial for national security and economic stability. In response, President Biden issued an Executive Order on May 12, 2021, aimed at modernizing federal government defenses and enhancing technology security. Additionally, the administration launched a 100-day initiative to improve cybersecurity in the electric sector and established voluntary cybersecurity goals for owners and operators of critical infrastructure through a National Security Memorandum issued on July 28.

The administration has also emphasized the importance of cybersecurity to the private sector and has engaged with them to prioritize it as a fundamental aspect of maintaining business continuity. Internationally, the Biden Administration has rallied G7 countries to hold nations accountable for harboring ransomware criminals and has updated NATO cyber policy for the first time in seven years.

The purpose of the meeting was to explore opportunities for strengthening the nation's cybersecurity both through collaboration and individual efforts. During the meeting, several participants announced commitments and initiatives to enhance cybersecurity.
