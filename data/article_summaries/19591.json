On July 16, 2009, Vice President Biden, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and AARP CEO Barry Rand held a Middle Class Task Force meeting on health care reform in Alexandria, Virginia. The meeting focused on how health care reform would benefit older Americans, including lowering costs, reducing waste, and improving quality. The event was open to the press, but media had to RSVP in advance. The meeting took place at The Durant Center in Alexandria, with media details provided for parking and access.
