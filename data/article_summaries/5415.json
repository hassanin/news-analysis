Vice President Kamala Harris recently convened a meeting with North Carolina state legislators, local leaders, and advocates to discuss the protection of reproductive rights. This meeting is part of a series of gatherings held by the Vice President with state legislators across the country. During the meeting, the attendees emphasized the need for a broad coalition to safeguard reproductive rights and expressed concerns about extreme laws proposed by Republican leaders in North Carolina that would restrict women's decision-making autonomy. The Vice President commended North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper for his efforts to protect access to reproductive healthcare, including issuing a state executive order and vetoing legislation aimed at limiting reproductive rights. The Vice President also shared the actions the Administration is taking on a national level in response to the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, such as protecting access to abortion medication, defending the right to travel, and addressing patient privacy. The Vice President encouraged the state legislators to continue their defense of women's rights in North Carolina and expressed her commitment to fighting alongside them for the well-being of the nation.
