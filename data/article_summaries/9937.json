Vice President Biden will be throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at Orioles Opening Day at Camden Yards. He will be accompanied by eight boys and girls from the Baltimore Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) League. The RBI program is designed to increase participation and interest in baseball, encourage academic participation and achievement, increase the number of talented athletes prepared to play in college and Minor Leagues, promote greater inclusion of minorities in the game, and teach the value of teamwork.
