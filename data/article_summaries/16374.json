In this article, President Barack Obama criticizes Republican leaders in Congress for prioritizing special interests over the American people. He mentions how Republicans opposed closing loopholes that benefited companies sending jobs overseas, despite the idea being popular among Americans. Obama proposes additional measures to promote economic growth, such as accelerated tax cuts for companies purchasing equipment and a new program to rebuild infrastructure. He argues that the Republican plan, which includes tax cuts for the wealthy and reducing regulations, is a continuation of the failed policies that led to the financial crisis. Obama also highlights that Republicans are not listening to the American people, as they oppose measures that protect workers and families. He concludes by emphasizing the need to ensure fair treatment for all Americans and to provide opportunities for those willing to work towards the American Dream.
