On October 14, 2009, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13515, which aimed to increase the participation of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) in federal programs. The order established the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The Commission would provide advice to the President on improving the quality of life for AAPIs, while the Initiative would work to increase AAPI participation in federal programs. The Executive Order also outlined the mission, membership, and administration of both the Commission and the Initiative. Each executive department and agency designated by the Initiative would be required to prepare a plan to improve the quality of life for AAPIs through increased participation in federal programs. The order superseded previous executive orders related to AAPI issues and was implemented subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations.
