The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new initiatives to expand access for small businesses, particularly those owned by individuals from underrepresented communities, to federal contracts. These initiatives aim to increase the share of federal contracting dollars going to socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (SDBs) to 15% by FY 2025, a 50% increase from when President Biden first took office. In FY 2022, small businesses received nearly $163 billion in federal contracting dollars, with $70 billion earned by SDBs. The Administration has also released new data for FY 2022, showing that businesses owned by historically underrepresented groups earned more through federal contracts across every category. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued new guidance to federal agencies, providing technical resources to SDBs, and sharing data on federal contracts to traditionally underserved small businesses. These actions build upon the Administration's efforts to support small businesses, including the public release of federal contract data broken down by business owner race and ethnicity.
