On October 6, 2017, the President signed four laws into effect. 

The first law, H.R. 2519, called "The American Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act," requires the Department of the Treasury to create and distribute coins in honor of the 100th anniversary of The American Legion.

The second law, S. 327, known as the "Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 2017," provides a safe harbor for certain investment fund research reports published by brokers and dealers. This law exempts them from Securities and Exchange Commission registration requirements.

The third law, S. 810, authorizes the construction and operation of a bridge, named the Riverside Bridge Project, in Christian County, Missouri. This law allows the construction to proceed despite specific Federal flood mitigation requirements.

The fourth law, S. 1141, is called the "Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017." This law encourages women's participation in conflict prevention.
