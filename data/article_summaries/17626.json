The Obama administration announced two new executive actions to reduce gun violence. The first action closes a loophole that allows individuals to evade background checks by registering dangerous weapons to a trust or corporation. The proposed regulation would require individuals associated with trusts or corporations to undergo background checks. The second action denies requests to bring military-grade firearms back into the United States for private entities, with a few exceptions such as museums. The goal of these actions is to keep the most dangerous firearms out of the wrong hands and reduce gun violence.
