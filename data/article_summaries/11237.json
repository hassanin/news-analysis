The White House has released a strategy to combat transnational organized crime (TOC). The strategy is based on the principles of building, balancing, and integrating the tools of American power to fight against TOC and related threats to national security. The strategy aims to enhance international cooperation in combating transnational crime and protect citizens from violence and exploitation. The expanding size and influence of TOC networks pose a significant challenge to U.S. and international security. TOC networks are involved in a range of illicit activities and have deepened their penetration into states, leading to co-option and weakening of governance. They also threaten the rule of law by establishing alliances with elements of government and big business figures. TOC poses a threat to U.S. economic interests and can cause damage to the world financial system. TOC networks are increasingly involved in terrorism, smuggling, trafficking, intellectual property theft, and cybercrime. The strategy has five strategic objectives: protect Americans and partners from harm caused by TOC networks, help partner countries strengthen governance and transparency, break the economic power of TOC networks, defeat the networks that pose the greatest threat to national security, and build international consensus and cooperation to combat transnational organized crime. The strategy includes 56 priority actions, such as enhancing intelligence sharing, protecting the financial system, strengthening interdiction and prosecutions, disrupting drug trafficking, and building international partnerships. The strategy also introduces new capabilities and tools, including a sanctions program, legislative proposals, a new Presidential Proclamation, and a rewards program. Implementation of the strategy will be overseen by the Interagency Policy Committee on Illicit Drugs and Transnational Criminal Threats.
