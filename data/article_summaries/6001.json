Today marks one year of a truce in the Yemen war, which has saved many Yemeni lives and allowed for increased humanitarian assistance and travel throughout the Middle East. The focus of the administration is to maintain this truce, strengthen progress toward peace, and support all efforts for a comprehensive resolution to the conflict. The United States remains committed to its partners in the region and supporting Saudi Arabia and the UAE against Iranian enabled attacks. The cessation of cross-border attacks from Yemen and airstrikes inside Yemen in the past year is seen as a positive outcome of the truce. The administration looks forward to working with all regional partners to permanently end the war in Yemen.
