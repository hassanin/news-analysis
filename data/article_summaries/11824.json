The White House has released a memorandum in which President Barack Obama determines that it is in the national interest of the United States to waive certain provisions of the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008. The waivers apply to Burma, Iraq, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Somalia, and South Sudan. The waivers allow for the provision of military assistance and support to these countries, to varying extents, to help them address critical issues such as countering armed groups and supporting humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts. The memorandum authorizes the Secretary of State to submit this determination to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
