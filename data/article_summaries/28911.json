President Donald J. Trump sent a letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, stating that he concurred with the Secretary of Commerce's finding that imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts threaten to impair the national security of the United States. He directed the United States Trade Representative to pursue negotiations with the European Union, Japan, and any other country deemed appropriate, in order to address this threat. The President also highlighted factors such as decreased market share of American-owned producers, reduced ability to fund research and development, and the importance of American-owned automotive manufacturing to national security. He instructed the Secretary of Commerce to continue monitoring imports and to inform him of any circumstances that might require further action.
