This article discusses the executive order issued by President Donald Trump on June 15, 2017, focusing on promoting affordable education and rewarding jobs for American workers. The order highlights the need for reform in the education systems and workforce development programs in the United States. It acknowledges the increasing unaffordability of higher education and the failure of many colleges and universities to provide students with the necessary skills for high-paying jobs. The order emphasizes the importance of expanding apprenticeships and reforming ineffective education and workforce development programs to address these issues. It also aims to reduce the regulatory burden on apprenticeship programs and eliminate taxpayer support for ineffective programs. The order establishes the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion, which will identify strategies and proposals to promote apprenticeships, especially in sectors with insufficient programs. Additionally, the order emphasizes the promotion of apprenticeship programs at colleges and universities and the improvement of the effectiveness of workforce development programs. The order provides definitions for apprenticeships and job training programs, and it outlines the responsibilities of various government agencies in implementing these initiatives.
