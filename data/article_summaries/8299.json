President Joseph R. Biden has signed into law H.R. 4004, the "United States-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade First Agreement Implementation Act." The Act imposes requirements on the negotiations of certain trade agreements between the United States and Taiwan. However, Section 7 of the Act raises constitutional concerns. Section 7(b) requires the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to provide negotiating texts to congressional committees during negotiations with a foreign partner, while Section 7(c) prevents the USTR from transmitting United States-proposed texts to Taiwan while Congress is reviewing them. Section 7(c) also gives two members of Congress the power to increase the waiting period before the USTR can provide texts to Taiwan, which violates INS v. Chadha. Furthermore, Section 7(d) requires the inclusion of members of Congress as accredited members of the United States delegation who would receive daily briefings, including tentative agreements. President Biden states that if these requirements infringe upon his constitutional authority to negotiate with a foreign partner, his administration will treat them as non-binding.
