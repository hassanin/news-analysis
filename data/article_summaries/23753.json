President Barack Obama has declared September 16 to September 22, 2012, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. This proclamation honors the service and sacrifice of the National Guard and Reserve members, who have played a crucial role in defending the fundamental rights of Americans. The proclamation also recognizes the employers who support these service members and emphasizes the importance of providing opportunities and support for troops, military families, and veterans. The President highlights the courage and dedication of Guard and Reserve members who have served both domestically and in war zones, and emphasizes the need for businesses to create a military-supportive culture in the workplace. The Obama administration has made efforts to expand employment opportunities for veterans and military spouses through initiatives like Joining Forces. The President also mentions the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which provides tax credits to encourage employers to hire veterans, and the overhaul of the transition assistance program to help departing service members find employment or further their education. The proclamation calls on all Americans, as well as state and local officials, private organizations, and military commanders, to express gratitude and observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
