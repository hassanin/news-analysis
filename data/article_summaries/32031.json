President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring September 17-23, 2017, as Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week. The proclamation aims to bring attention to the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States, which has resulted in approximately 64,000 deaths from drug overdoses last year alone. The majority of these deaths were caused by opioids, and the number of infants born with opioid dependence has quadrupled in the past decade. The proclamation highlights the efforts of the Department of Health and Human Services and the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis to address the epidemic. The administration has committed significant resources, including $1.3 billion in investments, to fight this crisis. The proclamation calls upon Americans to observe the awareness week with appropriate programs and activities that raise awareness about the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.
