The White House Press Secretary criticizes the House Republican Budget, stating that it favors tax cuts for millionaires while potentially raising taxes on middle-class families with children. The Press Secretary warns that if this budget is enacted, over 1.1 million people could lose access to job training and employment services, more than 600,000 students could lose Pell Grants for college, and around 170,000 children could lose access to early-childhood education. Additionally, investments in infrastructure, scientific research, and healthcare coverage would be significantly reduced. The President believes in growing the economy from the middle-out, expanding opportunities for all Americans. The Press Secretary urges House Republicans to support measures such as raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance, promoting paycheck fairness, and passing bipartisan immigration reform.
