President Biden will announce a comprehensive set of executive actions to increase the economic security of military and veteran spouses, caregivers, and survivors. The actions aim to enhance career stability and expand employment resources and support for this community. Military-connected families, especially women, often struggle to achieve their desired career goals due to deployments, frequent moves, and caring for wounded service members. The unemployment rate among military spouses is 21 percent, which has remained unchanged over the past decade. The executive actions recognize the commitment and resilience of military-connected families and aim to eliminate barriers to employment and increase economic opportunities. The actions also build on the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to enhance the health, wellbeing, and economic security of military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. These actions include the participation of executive agencies in the Military Spouse Employment Partnership, the launch of a paid fellowship program for military spouses in the private sector, and the evaluation of pay and benefits for factors such as military spouse unemployment and childcare access. Additionally, there have been efforts to make childcare and long-term care more accessible and affordable for military and veteran families.
