President Donald Trump has signed the America's Conservation Enhancement Act into law, but he has expressed concerns about a provision in the Act that requires a Task Force to engage with foreign governments. Trump believes that this provision interferes with his exclusive authority to conduct the nation's foreign affairs as outlined in Article II of the Constitution. As a result, his administration will treat this provision as advisory and non-binding.
