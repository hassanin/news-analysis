President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Supporting Older Americans Act of 2020" (H.R. 4334). This law includes a provision (Section 127) that requires the Assistant Secretary for Aging of the Department of Health and Human Services to appoint a person to a position that may qualify as an inferior office under the Appointments Clause. The Trump Administration intends to interpret this section in a way that ensures the appointment is made in accordance with the Constitution. The signing of this law took place on March 25, 2020, at the White House.
