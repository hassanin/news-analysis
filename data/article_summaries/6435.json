Tritium, an electric vehicle (EV) charger manufacturer, will be establishing its first U.S. manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee. The facility will have six production lines capable of producing up to 30,000 Buy America-compliant DC Fast Chargers per year and will create 500 local jobs. This announcement is part of a trend of major companies investing in U.S. manufacturing and job creation, including Intel, General Motors, and Boeing. The Biden-Harris Administration has been focused on revitalizing domestic manufacturing and strengthening critical supply chains. The Build America, Buy America Act in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law expands on these efforts by ensuring that future infrastructure projects are made in America by American workers. The administration has set an ambitious target of achieving a 50% share of EV sales in the U.S. by 2030 and has allocated funding for securing an American EV supply chain and building a nationwide public EV charging network. The Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy will soon announce state allocations and guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, which will provide funding to help states create a network of EV charging stations along designated Alternative Fuel Corridors on the Interstate Highway System.
