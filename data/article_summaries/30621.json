President Trump signed the VA Mission Act, also known as the Choice Act, which provides healthcare choice and freedom to veterans. The legislation allows veterans to seek medical care from private providers if the VA cannot meet their needs in a timely manner. It also expands access to the caregiver program for seriously injured veterans, speeds up the claims process, increases health services, expands access to walk-in clinics, and fights opioid addiction. The President emphasized that veterans deserve the best care and thanked the leaders and organizations that worked to pass the legislation. He also mentioned the historic low unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanics, and women, and the strong economy. The signing of the VA Mission Act is seen as a fulfillment of President Trump's promise to reform the VA and improve care for veterans.
