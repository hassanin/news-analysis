In this article, President Donald Trump proclaims September 2020 as National Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a chronic and inherited condition that primarily affects African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. It causes blood cells to become sickle-shaped, which disrupts blood flow and can lead to organ damage. The article highlights the need for improved care for SCD patients, as currently only one in four patients in America receive the necessary care. The Trump administration has taken steps to address this issue, including signing the "Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2018" into law. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is working to identify and address barriers to care, and various organizations are developing education and training programs for healthcare providers. The HHS has also collaborated with states on new payment models to ensure children with SCD receive the care they need. The article mentions progress in extending the lives of Americans with SCD and finding a cure by 2029. Initiatives such as the Sickle Cell Disease Training and Mentoring Program (STAMP) and the "Cure Sickle Cell Initiative" are aimed at training healthcare providers, developing new treatments, and accelerating gene therapies to cure the disease. The United States is also involved in international efforts, such as the Sickle Pan African Research Consortium, to raise awareness and develop gene-based cures. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe National Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month with appropriate programs and activities to eliminate the disease and improve the quality of life for those living with SCD.
