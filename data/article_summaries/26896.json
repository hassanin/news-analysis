The current situation at the southern border is described as a border security and humanitarian crisis that poses a threat to national security interests and is considered a national emergency. President Donald J. Trump is said to be justified in declaring a national emergency and using other statutory authorities to address the crisis. Past presidents have also declared national emergencies under the National Emergencies Act. President Trump is using funds appropriated by Congress, funds reallocated under statutory authority, and funds available during a national emergency. These funds will be used to secure the border and protect the safety and well-being of the country.
