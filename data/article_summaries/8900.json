President Joe Biden has issued an executive order aimed at promoting clean and efficient cars and trucks in the United States. The order sets a goal that 50% of all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles. The administration plans to prioritize setting clear standards, expanding infrastructure, spurring innovation, and investing in the American autoworker to achieve this goal. The order also directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation to consider establishing new emissions and fuel economy standards for various vehicle categories starting in 2027 and extending through at least 2030. The EPA will consider new multi-pollutant emissions standards, including greenhouse gas emissions, for light- and medium-duty vehicles, as well as new oxides of nitrogen standards for heavy-duty engines and vehicles. The Department of Transportation will consider new fuel economy and fuel efficiency standards for passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans. The order emphasizes the importance of coordination, engagement, and consultation with various stakeholders, including the State of California and other leading states in reducing vehicle emissions. The implementation of the order will be consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
