President Barack Obama has issued a Presidential Memorandum notifying the Congress of his intent to add the Republic of South Sudan to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. South Sudan became an independent nation on July 9, 2011. The President has determined that South Sudan meets the criteria to be designated as a GSP beneficiary developing country. Additionally, South Sudan will also be added to the list of least developed beneficiary countries under the GSP program. The President has determined that it is appropriate to extend least developed beneficiary developing country benefits to South Sudan.
