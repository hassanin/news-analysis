President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 2011 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. Ovarian cancer has one of the highest mortality rates among all cancers and is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States. The proclamation aims to remember those who have lost their lives to ovarian cancer, support those currently living with the disease, raise awareness about ovarian cancer, and advance screening and treatment capabilities. Ovarian cancer is often not detected in time for successful interventions due to a lack of early symptoms and effective screening tests. Women are encouraged to learn about risk factors, including family history, and to discuss possible symptoms with their doctors. The Affordable Care Act provides preventive screenings for women without any copayments, deductibles, or coinsurance. The government is committed to supporting efforts to end ovarian cancer through education campaigns, research, and funding for prevention and treatment. The proclamation calls upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, healthcare providers, and research institutions to raise awareness and help Americans live longer, healthier lives.
