The Office of National Drug Control Policy has designated 10 new areas across Kentucky, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and West Virginia as High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs). This designation allows these areas to receive federal resources to enhance coordination and development of drug control efforts among various law enforcement agencies. The HIDTA program, created in 1988, serves as a catalyst for collaboration among federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies in critical drug trafficking regions, working to decrease drug production, transportation, and distribution. Currently, there are 29 HIDTAs located in 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia.
