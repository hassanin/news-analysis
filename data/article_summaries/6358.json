The White House has provided updates on several issues. Firstly, the President has spoken with the mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, and the FEMA Administrator has spoken with the governor to coordinate assistance following severe flooding in the state. FEMA personnel are on-site and working with state officials to identify resource requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency is also sending a subject-matter expert to assess the impact on Jackson's water treatment plants and expedite equipment delivery for repairs. 

The White House also expressed condolences to the people of Pakistan following severe flooding there. USAID is providing an additional $30 million in humanitarian assistance to support those affected by the flooding. The United States has been a significant humanitarian donor to Pakistan and will continue to monitor the situation for further needs. 

Additionally, the White House announced new initiatives to strengthen the teaching profession and address teacher shortages. These include commitments from job platforms like ZipRecruiter and Indeed to make it easier to find teaching opportunities, as well as initiatives from teacher unions and organizations to expand pathways into the profession. The First Lady, Domestic Policy Advisor, and Secretaries of Education and Labor also met with public and private sector leaders to discuss strategies to address teacher shortages. 

The White House also recognized International Overdose Awareness Day and announced additional funding of around $80 million for prevention and treatment of substance use and overdose.
