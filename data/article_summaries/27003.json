President Donald J. Trump has announced that the United States will host a delegation from China for trade discussions on January 30-31, 2019. The US trade team will be led by United States Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer and will include other officials such as Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. The meetings are part of the agreement reached between President Trump and President Xi Jinping in December 2018 to engage in 90 days of negotiations to address trade issues between the two countries. The discussions will focus on achieving structural changes in China's trade practices and China's pledge to purchase goods and services from the United States. The meetings will be held at the White House's Eisenhower Executive Office Building.
