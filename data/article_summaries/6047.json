President Biden has signed an Executive Order to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal workforce. The order recognizes that employment discrimination, systemic racism, and gender inequality still persist in the workforce and aims to address these issues. The initiative will be led by the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget, in collaboration with the White House and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. It will focus on advancing opportunities for underserved communities, including people of color, women, individuals with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and more. The order directs agencies to assess the current state of DEIA within their workforces and develop strategic plans to eliminate barriers faced by underserved employees. It also encourages agencies to establish or elevate Chief Diversity Officers and expand DEIA training throughout the Federal workforce. The order addresses workplace harassment, reduces reliance on unpaid internships, advances pay equity, promotes equity for individuals with disabilities and LGBTQ+ public servants, builds a more diverse pipeline into public service, expands employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals, and improves the collection of demographic data about the Federal workforce.
