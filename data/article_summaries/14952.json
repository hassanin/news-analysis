The White House briefing on June 12, 2009, featured Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and UN Ambassador Susan Rice discussing the unanimous passing of a resolution imposing tough sanctions on North Korea. The resolution condemned North Korea's actions and demanded that it halt all nuclear and missile activity. The sanctions included a complete embargo on the export of arms by North Korea, broad financial sanctions to prevent funding of WMD or proliferation activities, an inspection regime for contraband cargo, adding more companies and individuals to the asset freeze list, and a stepped-up monitoring mechanism. The briefing also touched on the potential military option, North Korea's response to the sanctions, and the issue of humanitarian aid. The President's schedule for the upcoming week was also outlined, including a speech at the American Medical Association and a meeting with South Korean President Lee. The briefing concluded with questions about Guantanamo Bay, the President's approval ratings, and General Jones' role as National Security Advisor.
