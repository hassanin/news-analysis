In recognition of Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, the Biden-Harris Administration is highlighting key actions it has taken to improve suicide prevention. Suicide is a complex issue with no single cause or solution, but the Administration is committed to taking aggressive actions. In 2021, suicide was a leading cause of death in the United States, claiming the lives of over 47,000 individuals. It was also the second leading cause of death among young people. The Administration wants those experiencing emotional distress to know that they are loved and not alone. They encourage people to reach out for help by calling or texting 9-8-8, the National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
