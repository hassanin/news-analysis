The call discussed efforts by the administration to increase the availability of safe infant formula in the United States. One of the main reasons for the shortage is the closure of a major formula producer, Abbott Nutrition, due to safety concerns from the FDA. The FDA and Abbott have agreed on next steps to reopen the facility, including the implementation of a detailed sanitation plan and an independent review of the facility's operations. The FDA has also released guidance under which major formula manufacturers can apply to import formula that is not currently being produced for the U.S. market. The FDA will prioritize applications that are most likely to be successful and will prioritize quality and safety. The administration is also working with manufacturers and retailers to identify transportation and logistical needs to increase the amount and speed of formula being shipped into the country. They have also been engaging with pediatricians and parents' groups to share information and resources. The FDA expects imported formula to be available on shelves in a matter of weeks. In the meantime, families are encouraged to talk to their pediatricians and have confidence in switching between different infant formula brands that are available in stores. It is not safe to water down formula or make homemade infant formula.
