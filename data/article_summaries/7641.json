Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer spoke with President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia today. Mr. Finer expressed the United States' concern about the tense situation in northern Kosovo and called for all parties involved to take steps to de-escalate the situation. He specifically urged the Serbian government to withdraw its armed forces near the border and reduce their state of readiness. Additionally, he encouraged the government to urge protesters in northern Kosovo to remain peaceful. Mr. Finer emphasized that the United States expects both sides to re-engage in the EU-facilitated Dialogue and fully implement the normalization agreement reached in Brussels and Ohrid earlier this year.
