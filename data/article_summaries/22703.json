The statement from the White House Press Secretary highlights the positive step taken in moving away from political brinkmanship that is harming the economy. The American economy is progressing, but there is still work to be done to ensure that more middle-class Americans can succeed. The statement calls for Congress to raise the minimum wage to prevent full-time workers from living in poverty, restore emergency unemployment insurance for those searching for jobs, and take further actions to strengthen the economy and provide opportunities for all Americans. The President expresses willingness to collaborate with both sides to achieve these goals.
