Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats' vote to hold Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross in contempt is seen as a lawless attempt to harass the President and his Administration. The Departments of Justice and Commerce have already provided over 31,000 pages of documents to the House regarding the census issue, and senior officials have spoken about the matter. Democrats are demanding documents that are subject to executive privilege, even though they have no legal right to them. This move is seen as a display of shameful and cynical politics.
