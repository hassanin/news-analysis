On World Refugee Day, the President acknowledges the millions of people who have been displaced from their homes and the challenges they face. This year, global displacement has reached record levels, with nearly 60 million people uprooted by wars, violence, and persecution. The struggles of refugees are seen in images of people waiting at border crossings, living in tents, and traveling in unsafe boats. The United States, as the largest global donor of humanitarian aid, supports programs that provide food, water, shelter, and medical care to refugees. The President expresses gratitude to aid workers and families who assist refugees and acknowledges the contributions of displaced individuals to the nation.
