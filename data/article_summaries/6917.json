President Biden has issued a proclamation declaring June 2021 as LGBTQ+ Pride Month. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken significant steps to promote LGBTQ+ equality, including signing an executive order preventing discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation, launching a cross-government initiative to advance equity for underserved communities, and reversing the ban on transgender servicemembers serving in the Armed Forces. The administration is committed to fighting discrimination and hate against LGBTQ+ Americans, especially transgender individuals and people of color. President Biden urges the U.S. Senate to pass the Equality Act to provide civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ people across the country. The administration is also working to advance LGBTQ+ rights globally, protect LGBTQ+ refugees and asylum seekers, and combat discrimination against LGBTQ+ people around the world. In addition, President Biden has established the White House Gender Policy Council, ensured educational environments are free from sex discrimination, and appointed diverse LGBTQ+ leaders to key positions in his administration. The State Department has also announced that U.S. embassies can fly the Pride flag alongside the U.S. flag to demonstrate support for LGBTQ+ human rights worldwide.
