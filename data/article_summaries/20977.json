The President of the United States, Barack Obama, issued a statement in November 2013 congratulating the Illinois General Assembly for legalizing marriage equality in Illinois. He expressed his belief that gay and lesbian Americans should be treated fairly and equally under the law, and that same-sex couples should have the right to marry. Obama and his wife, Michelle, were overjoyed for the committed couples in Illinois whose love would now be recognized legally. He also commended the General Assembly for involving the religious community in the conversation and ensuring that churches and other religious institutions could still make their own decisions regarding same-sex marriage. Obama emphasized that treating gay brothers and sisters equally under the law was an important step in perfecting the nation's union.
