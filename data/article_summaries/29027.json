The manufacturing and defense industrial base of the United States, which is crucial for national security, is under threat while China, Russia, and other competitors are strengthening their military capabilities. President Trump recognizes the importance of relying on domestic companies for manufacturing products needed for national defense. He believes that the nation should not become dependent on foreign nations for designing, producing, and maintaining important defense assets. Manufacturing is also important for job creation and economic strength. President Trump signed an executive order in 2017 to assess and strengthen the manufacturing and defense industrial base, and the recently released report highlights the gaps and vulnerabilities that need immediate attention. The report proposes ways for industry and government to work together to defend the country efficiently and wisely. President Trump believes that having the strongest military is crucial for deterring enemies and preventing war, and he has increased investment in defense to achieve this goal.
