In this letter, President Barack Obama discusses an alternative plan for pay increases for civilian federal employees for 2014. He acknowledges that these employees have already experienced a three-year pay freeze and have made significant sacrifices. However, in light of the country's ongoing economic recovery, the President believes it is necessary to maintain efforts to ensure a sustainable fiscal course. As such, he has determined that for 2014, across-the-board pay increases will be 1.0 percent, and the current locality pay percentages will remain at their 2013 levels. The President states that this decision will not negatively impact the government's ability to attract and retain a well-qualified federal workforce. The adjustments will take effect on the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2014.
