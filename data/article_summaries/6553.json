President Biden has announced additional steps to implement his National Strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. These steps include increasing the vaccine supply to states, tribes, and territories, as well as increasing funding to jurisdictions to help administer vaccinations. Starting next week, the first phase of the federal pharmacy program will launch, allowing select pharmacies nationwide to offer vaccinations to their communities. These efforts aim to meet the President's goal of administering 100 million shots in 100 days and expanding access to vaccines for more Americans. The Biden-Harris Administration will increase the overall weekly vaccine supply to 10.5 million doses nationwide, representing a 22% increase since taking office. The federal pharmacy program is a public-private partnership with 21 national pharmacy partners and networks of independent pharmacies, with the goal of expanding equitable access to vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) worked with states to select initial pharmacy partners based on their ability to reach populations at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19. The President is also increasing reimbursements to states, fully reimbursing them for FEMA-eligible services backdated to the beginning of the pandemic. This reimbursement is estimated to total $3-5 billion. President Biden is requesting $350 billion from Congress in the American Rescue Plan to fully support states, tribes, and territories in their efforts to contain the pandemic and vaccinate their populations. The participating federal pharmacy partners include major chains such as Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy, Walmart, Rite Aid, Kroger, Publix, Costco, Albertsons, Hy-Vee, Meijer, H-E-B, and more.
