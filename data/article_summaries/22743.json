President Obama has called on Congress to extend the Economic Recovery Payment for 2010, providing an additional $250 to seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities who are struggling financially. This payment aims to assist those whose retirement savings have not fully recovered from the recession's impact. The proposal would benefit 57 million people, including Social Security beneficiaries, Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries, veterans benefit recipients, railroad retirement and disability beneficiaries, and public-employee retirees. The total cost of the proposal is estimated to be $13 billion, and it would not affect the solvency of Social Security. The Economic Recovery Payments have previously been made to 55 million people, totaling $13.7 billion. In addition to this proposal, steps will be taken to prevent reductions in contributions to tax-favored retirement systems in 2010.
