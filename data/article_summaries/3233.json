President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed September 2021 as National Sickle Cell Awareness Month in the United States. Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects around 100,000 Americans, causing severe pain, infections, and organ damage. The disease disproportionately affects Black and Brown Americans, with 1 in 365 Black Americans and 1 in 14,000 Hispanic Americans suffering from it. The President is committed to supporting those affected by SCD and improving their quality of life and health outcomes. Medical professionals and scientists are working to find a cure and develop better treatments for SCD, with recent advances in drug therapies and bone marrow transplants. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is supporting SCD research and the "Cure Sickle Cell Initiative" to accelerate gene therapies for a cure. The Administration aims to address health disparities, improve access to quality healthcare, and collaborate with partners to support families affected by SCD. The proclamation encourages people to learn more about the progress being made to reduce the burden of the disease.
