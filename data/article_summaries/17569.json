The Department of Energy has released a report on the economic impact of Recovery Act investments in advanced batteries and vehicles. The report highlights several key findings, including:

1. For every dollar of the $2.4 billion in government funding provided through the Recovery Act, companies have matched it at minimum dollar for dollar.

2. Due to Recovery Act investments, the U.S. will have the capacity to produce 20 percent of the world's batteries for advanced vehicles by 2012, and up to 40 percent by 2015.

3. Nine new battery plants will have started construction as a result of Recovery Act investments, with four of them operational by the end of the year. Additionally, twenty-one other plants will produce battery or electric vehicle components with the help of Recovery Act grants.

4. The higher-volume domestic manufacturing spurred by the Recovery Act is expected to dramatically reduce the cost of batteries for electric vehicles. The cost of a battery for a car with a 100-mile range could come down to $16,000 by the end of 2013 and $10,000 by the end of 2015.

5. Recovery Act investments will result in over 20,000 electric vehicle charging locations in the U.S. by 2012, compared to less than 500 before the Act.

The report was released ahead of President Obama's visit to the groundbreaking ceremony of the new Compact Power plant in Holland, MI. The plant will manufacture batteries to support 52,000 Chevy Volts per year and also supply batteries for the new electric Ford Focus.
