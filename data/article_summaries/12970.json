Belgium and the United States have successfully completed the removal of a significant amount of excess highly enriched uranium (HEU) and separated plutonium from Belgium. This removal was part of their commitment made at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit to work together to remove this material before the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit. The operation involved developing a new facility for plutonium packaging, training and certifying personnel, validating certificates for a U.S.-designed nuclear material package, and addressing materials in unique forms. Despite technical challenges, the operation was completed on schedule and the material was safely packaged in transport containers certified by regulators in both countries. The United States, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) cooperated to securely transport the material to its final destination. Belgium and the United States plan to continue their cooperation to eliminate additional excess special nuclear material and assist other countries in doing the same.
