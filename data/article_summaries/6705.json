President Biden is hosting the United We Stand Summit at the White House to address the impact of hate-fueled violence on democracy and public safety. The Summit aims to honor communities affected by hateful attacks and promote a shared vision for a more united America. The Administration will establish the White House Initiative on Hate-Motivated Violence to enhance coordination and engagement in preventing and responding to hate-motivated violence. The President is also calling on Congress to increase investments in national service and civics education, as well as enact new legislation to prevent hate-motivated violence. Non-federal public and private institutions will be engaged in efforts to foster civic unity and address hate-fueled violence. The Citizens' Initiative will host public listening sessions and develop recommendations for community-based efforts. The technology sector is also urged to take responsibility for curbing the spread of hate-fueled violence online and offline.
