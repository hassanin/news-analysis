President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Tennessee due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from March 25 to April 3, 2021. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The funding will be available to individuals in the counties of Davidson, Williamson, and Wilson, and can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. State and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, can also receive federal funding for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Additionally, funding is available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Myra M. Shird has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, and more designations may be made in the future if requested by the state. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. seven days a week.
