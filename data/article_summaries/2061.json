The article discusses the continuation of the national emergency declared by the President of the United States with respect to North Korea. The national emergency was initially declared in 2008 due to the threat of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. Over the years, the national emergency has been expanded to address various actions and policies of the North Korean government, including unprovoked attacks, nuclear tests, missile launches, human rights abuses, and illicit activities. The President has signed multiple executive orders to address and take steps against these threats. The most recent executive order was signed in 2017. The article states that the national emergency must continue beyond June 26, 2022, as the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States still persists. The continuation of the national emergency was announced by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on June 13, 2022.
