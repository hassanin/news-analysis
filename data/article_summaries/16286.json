President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Alaska, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe winter storms and flooding in November 2011. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures in various regions of Alaska. Willie G. Nunn has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
