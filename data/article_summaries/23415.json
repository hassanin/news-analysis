The Obama Administration has announced that 68 cities, states, and businesses are working together to increase access to solar energy for all Americans. This includes commitments to scale up solar access and decrease energy bills in nearly 50 percent of households and businesses that cannot install solar systems. Community solar, which allows multiple households and businesses to invest in shared solar systems, is being promoted with an emphasis on low- and moderate-income households. Since President Obama took office, the amount of solar power installed in the U.S. has increased nearly twenty fold, and the average cost of a solar electric system has dropped by 50 percent. However, nearly 50 percent of American households and businesses are unable to install solar systems. Community solar has the potential to provide clean solar power to historically underserved communities and reduce the energy burden for low-income households. The National Community Solar Partnership, a collaboration between government agencies, solar companies, NGOs, and community leaders, is working to expand access to community solar. Private sector organizations are also committing to increase financing and deployment of community solar across the country. The Department of Energy and other initiatives are supporting the development and implementation of community solar programs.
