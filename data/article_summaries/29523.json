Melania and Donald Trump send their wishes to those observing Ash Wednesday, a holy day for Catholics and many other Christians. Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of the Lenten season, which is a time of fasting, praying, and acts of charity. The imposition of ashes on the forehead is a reminder of our mortality, Christ's love, and the importance of repentance and accepting the Gospel. The Trumps join in prayer with everyone observing this day and hope for a meaningful Lenten journey and a closer relationship with God.
