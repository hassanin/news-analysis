The United States and Singapore have a longstanding partnership focused on promoting peace, stability, and prosperity in Southeast Asia and beyond. The two countries have strong economic, cultural, and security ties. Thousands of U.S. companies have a presence in Singapore, supporting American jobs, while Singaporean students study in U.S. universities and there are partnerships between U.S. and Singaporean universities. Singapore also provides access for U.S. military units in the region. During the Vice President's visit to Singapore, key issues such as climate change, cybersecurity, growth and innovation, health security, common security challenges, space exploration, and people-to-people ties were discussed. The two countries will work together on climate action, cybersecurity cooperation, promoting growth and resilient supply chains, fighting COVID-19, upholding regional security, reinforcing space exploration norms, and deepening people-to-people ties, particularly in higher education.
