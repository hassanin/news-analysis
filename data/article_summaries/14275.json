In this article, President Obama urges the Senate to ratify the New START Treaty, stating that it is fundamental for the national security of the United States. He emphasizes that not ratifying the treaty would result in the loss of nuclear inspectors in Russia, undermine the international coalition pressuring Iran, jeopardize transportation routes used to equip troops in Afghanistan, and negate decades of nuclear security leadership and bipartisanship in the US. The President highlights the bipartisan support for the treaty, including endorsements from Republicans such as Colin Powell, George Schultz, Jim Baker, and Henry Kissinger. He explains that the treaty aims to reduce the nuclear arsenals of the US and Russia, while still maintaining strong nuclear deterrence and verification measures. The President also emphasizes that not ratifying the treaty would endanger the coalition against Iran and the transportation routes for troops in Afghanistan. He concludes by urging senators to prioritize national security and approve the New START Treaty.
