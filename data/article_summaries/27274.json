On July 26, 2019, President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency in response to the situation in Mali. The order cites various reasons for the declaration, including repeated violations of ceasefire arrangements, terrorist activities, drug trafficking, human rights abuses, and attacks against civilians and security forces. The order blocks all property and interests in property of individuals or entities determined to be responsible for or complicit in these activities. It also suspends the entry of aliens into the United States who meet certain criteria outlined in the order. The order prohibits the making of donations to blocked individuals or entities and any transactions that evade or avoid the prohibitions set forth in the order. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to implement the order and submit reports to Congress on the national emergency. The order emphasizes that it does not impair existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits.
