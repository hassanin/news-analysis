Mexico, the United States, and Canada have announced the successful completion of a joint nuclear security project to convert Mexico's research reactor from highly enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU). The project, initiated in 2010, was carried out with the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The conversion of the reactor from HEU to LEU fuel supports the goal of minimizing the use of HEU for civilian purposes and contributes to non-proliferation efforts. The conversion also extends the operation time of the reactor and enhances its capabilities for medical and industrial isotope production, among other applications. The leaders of the three countries expressed their appreciation for the collaboration and emphasized the importance of continued efforts to enhance nuclear security in the region and worldwide.
