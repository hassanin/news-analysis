The Biden Administration has released the first whole-of-government plan to address threats posed by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS or "drones") in the United States. The plan aims to expand the ability to protect against malicious UAS activity, determine who can take action against them, and ensure that actions are conducted lawfully. It also seeks to safeguard airspace, communications spectrums, individual privacy, civil liberties, and civil rights. The Administration is calling on Congress to pass legislation to address gaps in existing laws and policies that hinder government and law enforcement efforts to protect the American people and national security interests. The plan acknowledges the beneficial uses of UAS but emphasizes the need to prevent their misuse for nefarious purposes. The plan includes eight key recommendations for action.
