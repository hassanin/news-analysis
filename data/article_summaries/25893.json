On December 17, 1903, Orville Wright achieved the first sustained, controlled, powered, and manned flight in North Carolina, marking a significant moment in human history. Orville and his brother Wilbur designed and built the flying machine after years of research and testing. Their perseverance, courage, and determination exemplify American values. Through trial and error, they overcame challenges and revolutionized transportation, national defense, and global economic development. The Wright Brothers' accomplishments established America as a leader in aviation and paved the way for future flight heroes like Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, Chuck Yeager, and Neil Armstrong. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) continues their legacy by pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and discovery. December 17th is designated as "Wright Brothers Day" by Congress, and President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed December 17, 2020, as Wright Brothers Day, encouraging the nation to reflect on their influence and strive for a better future.
