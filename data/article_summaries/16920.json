The First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, is scheduled to travel to Qatar and Jordan to highlight her core initiative, Let Girls Learn. Let Girls Learn is a U.S. government effort to address the barriers that prevent over 62 million girls worldwide from attending school, especially adolescent girls. The trip aims to raise awareness about the importance of girls' education and support community-based solutions. In Qatar, Mrs. Obama will deliver remarks at the 2015 WISE Summit, which focuses on education issues. She will also visit a U.S. Air Force base near Doha and meet with servicemembers. In Jordan, she will visit a school constructed with USAID funding and meet with Queen Rania. The U.S. government is committed to supporting Jordan's education sector and providing assistance to Syrian refugees in the country.
