President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring May 1st as Loyalty Day in the United States. Loyalty Day is a day to express dedication to the nation and the Constitution. It was first proclaimed by President Eisenhower in 1955 to recognize American freedom and reaffirm commitment to the principles that make the country great. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of preserving liberty and the framework of limited government. It also highlights the unique foundation of the United States, which is based on shared ideas rather than common lineage or language. The proclamation calls for honoring the men and women who have served in the Armed Forces and have sacrificed for freedom and peace. It encourages Americans to observe Loyalty Day with appropriate ceremonies, including the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, and for government officials to display the American flag on all government buildings and grounds.
