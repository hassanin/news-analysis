President Joe Biden has proclaimed October 2022 as National Clean Energy Action Month, highlighting the importance of transitioning America to a clean energy future. The goals set by the Biden Administration include cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, achieving 100 percent clean electricity by 2035, and reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Significant progress has been made, such as creating the National Climate Task Force, strengthening environmental protections, and inspiring private sector commitments to clean energy. Key legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act, has been signed to support these goals, providing tax credits for electric vehicles, rebates for efficient appliances, and incentives for clean energy production. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is also mentioned, which invests in modernizing infrastructure to address the climate crisis, create jobs, and improve energy security. The Biden Administration is committed to ensuring that communities impacted by climate change and environmental injustice benefit from the clean energy economy. Efforts are also being made to support energy communities and address legacy pollution caused by fossil fuels. The proclamation emphasizes the urgency of the climate crisis and the need to invest in clean energy, modernize infrastructure, and create a safer and healthier future.
