The United States, along with international partners, has successfully removed 68 kilograms of highly enriched uranium (HEU) from the Czech Republic. This amount of HEU is enough to make two nuclear weapons. The material was securely transported to Russia, where it will be downblended into low enriched uranium (LEU) for use in nuclear power reactors. Unlike HEU, LEU cannot be used to make nuclear weapons. This achievement marks the tenth country from which all HEU has been removed since President Obama announced the effort to secure vulnerable nuclear material worldwide. The removal of HEU from the Czech Republic is the result of a collaborative effort involving the United States' National Nuclear Security Administration, the Czech Republic's Nuclear Research Institute, Russia's Federal Atomic Energy Agency, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The United States expresses gratitude to these partners and the Czech and Russian governments for their cooperation.
