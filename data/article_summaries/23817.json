The United States strongly condemns the assassination of the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov. The attack in Ankara left others wounded as well. The US offers condolences to the families and loved ones of Ambassador Karlov and the other victims, and stands united with Russia and Turkey in the fight against terrorism. The attack on a diplomat is unacceptable.
