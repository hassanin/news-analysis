The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new actions to support clean manufacturing and create jobs in the United States. These actions aim to promote the production of low-carbon steel, aluminum, and concrete needed for electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, and transportation infrastructure upgrades. The administration believes that these measures will revitalize local economies, lower prices for consumers, provide more union jobs, and enhance American competitiveness in global markets.

The industrial sector is responsible for a significant portion of domestic greenhouse gas emissions, and by helping manufacturers adopt clean energy and efficiency upgrades, the administration aims to support cleaner industry that can produce products for a net-zero economy. These improvements will also protect public health by reducing air and water pollution that disproportionately affects low-income households and communities of color.

The new initiatives include accelerating the use of clean hydrogen in sectors such as steel manufacturing, launching a "Buy Clean" procurement task force to promote the use of low-carbon construction materials in federal projects, using trade policies to reward clean manufacturing, and providing guidance on Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Sequestration (CCUS) technologies. The administration also aims to support equitable innovation in the industrial sector and establish research initiatives and advisory committees to drive industrial decarbonization.

Overall, these actions align with the administration's Build Back Better agenda and aim to boost clean manufacturing, American competitiveness, and job creation while addressing climate change and promoting sustainable economic growth.
