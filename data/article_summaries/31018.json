President Donald J. Trump issued a presidential memorandum on October 26, 2017, regarding the temporary certification for certain records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The memorandum states that the American public deserves access to these records, but certain information will continue to be redacted due to national security, law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns. The memorandum orders agencies to re-review these redactions within the next 180 days, and any information that does not meet the statutory standard for continued postponement of disclosure will be made public. The memorandum also directs agencies to identify information that can be publicly disclosed without harm to national security. Any agency seeking further postponement must adhere to the findings of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which states that continued protection of such records is rarely legitimate. The Archivist of the United States will review the recommendations from agencies and determine whether specific information warrants continued withholding from public disclosure after April 26, 2018. The memorandum concludes by authorizing the publication of this memorandum in the Federal Register.
