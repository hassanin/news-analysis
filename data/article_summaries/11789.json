President Obama has signed an emergency declaration for Pennsylvania due to the conditions caused by Hurricane Sandy. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts. The Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will coordinate disaster relief efforts to help alleviate the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources necessary to address the impacts of the emergency. The federal funding for emergency protective measures will be provided at 75 percent. Thomas J. McCool has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
