Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed leaders from CARICOM and the Dominican Republic to Blair House for a meeting. She expressed her pride in the commitment to work together and the regular communication and collaboration between their nations. Harris highlighted the three joint committees established between the United States and the Caribbean, focusing on energy security, finance, and food security. These committees have produced concrete solutions to address the climate crisis, with steps being taken to accelerate the implementation of the U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis (PACC 2030). The United States is committed to identifying new clean energy projects, providing technical assistance, attracting investors, and improving access to development financing. On the issue of food security, the United States has committed $28 million to provide assistance to the Caribbean. Actions to promote good agricultural practices, address logistical barriers, remove non-tariff barriers, incorporate climate-smart technology, and provide training on pest management have been developed. Harris emphasized the importance of the relationship between the United States and the Caribbean, based on shared bonds and interests, and pledged increased commitment and engagement with Caribbean partners. President Santokhi of Suriname, as the chair of CARICOM, also spoke about their role in the meeting.
