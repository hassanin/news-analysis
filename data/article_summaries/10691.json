President Obama has declared a major disaster in Massachusetts due to severe winter storm, snowstorm, and flooding that occurred in February 2013. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in the affected areas. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and snow assistance. Hazard mitigation measures will also be supported. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
