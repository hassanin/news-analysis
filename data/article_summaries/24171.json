Japan and the United States have announced that all highly enriched uranium (HEU) and separated plutonium fuel has been removed from Japan's Fast Critical Assembly (FCA). This is part of their joint effort to minimize the use of sensitive nuclear materials. The FCA, which was established in 1967, can now continue its mission without the need for HEU or plutonium fuels. The United States and Japan will also work together to remove HEU fuel from the Kyoto University Critical Assembly and convert it to low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel. This collaborative effort aims to eliminate the use of HEU in research reactors.
