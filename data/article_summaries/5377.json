Jill and I send our best wishes for a happy new year to all the people of Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as those around the world celebrating Enkutatash. We acknowledge the challenges faced by Ethiopian-Americans and Eritrean-Americans, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict in Ethiopia. The United States is actively engaged in diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts in the Horn of Africa and is committed to speaking out against violence and supporting humanitarian needs in the region. We believe that Ethiopia can overcome its current divisions and achieve peace through dialogue and unity. We hope that the new year brings peace, reconciliation, and healing to families and communities in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and globally.
