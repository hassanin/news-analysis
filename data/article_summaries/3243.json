President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Libya, which was declared in Executive Order 13566 in 2011 and expanded in Executive Order 13726 in 2016, will continue beyond February 25, 2023. The ongoing civil conflict in Libya is a result of actions taken by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his government in 2011. The conflict will persist until Libyans resolve their political divisions and foreign military intervention ends. There is a risk of misappropriation of Libyan state assets by parties seeking to undermine the United Nations peace process, including former members of the Qadhafi government and his close associates. This diversion of resources could prolong and deepen the instability in Libya, benefiting terrorist groups like ISIS. To protect against the abuse of assets and hinder Libyan national reconciliation, including by Qadhafi's family and associates, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
