President Obama has announced a major expansion of Skills for America's Future, an initiative aimed at improving industry partnerships with community colleges and workforce development strategies. The initiative, launched by the Administration last year, aims to provide 500,000 community college students with industry-recognized credentials that will help them secure jobs in the manufacturing sector. The Manufacturing Institute, a key partner of Skills for America's Future, will lead this effort. The lack of a standardized credentialing system in the manufacturing sector is a challenge, and the Manufacturing Skills Certification System aims to address this by providing students with credentials that are recognized by manufacturing firms across state lines. The Administration also announced new public-private partnerships and initiatives to enhance the nation's manufacturing workforce, including a program to promote a curriculum based on NAM's advanced manufacturing skills certification system in community colleges, partnerships with high schools and colleges to adopt these credentials, an online career website called Pipeline, and a career awareness campaign. The article also highlights the Administration's previous investments in community colleges and initiatives by the Department of Labor and Health and Human Services to address skilled worker shortages in other industries.
