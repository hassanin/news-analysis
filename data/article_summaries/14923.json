President Barack Obama has published a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe will continue beyond March 6, 2010. This national emergency is in response to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other individuals who are undermining Zimbabwe's democratic processes and institutions. The crisis caused by these actions and policies has not been resolved, and they continue to pose a significant threat to the foreign policy of the United States. As a result, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency and the sanctions in place to address this threat.
