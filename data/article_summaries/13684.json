The Obama Administration has announced new initiatives to help veterans find jobs and strengthen the economy. The initiatives include tax credits for firms that hire unemployed veterans and those with service-connected disabilities. The President also announced executive actions to provide resources for veterans to transition their military experience to the private job market and to help them find job opportunities. These actions include the launch of the Veteran Gold Card, which provides personalized case management and counseling for Post-9/11 veterans, the launch of an online resource called My Next Move for Veterans to help veterans explore civilian occupations, and the creation of the Veterans Job Bank to connect veterans with job postings from companies looking to hire them. Various public and private sector resources are also involved in supporting these initiatives.
