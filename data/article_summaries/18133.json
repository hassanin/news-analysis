The op-ed by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers discusses the agenda for the G-20 Summit in Toronto. They highlight the importance of global economic cooperation to ensure strong growth and job creation. They also mention the progress made since the previous G-20 meetings, with the global economy expanding and world trade increasing. In the United States, the economy has experienced a significant turnaround, with growth exceeding 3% and the private sector generating new jobs. They attribute this recovery to actions taken to repair the financial system and implement policies to stimulate demand.
