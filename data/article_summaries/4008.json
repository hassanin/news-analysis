The passing of Harry Belafonte, a groundbreaking American, is deeply saddening to Jill and the narrator. Belafonte, born to Caribbean parents in Harlem in 1927, dedicated his life to breaking barriers and bridging divides. He achieved many firsts in his career, such as being the first Black matinee idol and the first recording artist to sell over a million records. Despite his fame and fortune, Belafonte used his platform for the public good. He was a strong ally of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement, raising money for bail, supporting the Freedom Rides, and advocating against apartheid in South Africa. Belafonte's humanitarian and artistic efforts earned him prestigious honors and awards. His legacy will be remembered for his advocacy, compassion, and respect for human dignity. The narrator extends their condolences to Belafonte's family and his admirers worldwide.
