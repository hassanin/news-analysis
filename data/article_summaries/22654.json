Vice President Joe Biden announced a six-year plan to build a national high-speed rail network that would give 80% of Americans access to high-speed rail within 25 years. The plan includes dedicating $53 billion over six years to continue construction of the rail network. The proposal aims to revitalize America's domestic rail manufacturing industry and create job opportunities. The plan focuses on developing three types of interconnected corridors: core express, regional, and emerging. The Department of Transportation will work with states, freight rail, and private companies to identify corridors for construction and raise speeds on existing rail lines. The plan also includes streamlining the Department of Transportation's rail programs and consolidating high-speed and intercity passenger rail programs into two new accounts. This comprehensive plan is part of President Obama's commitment to rebuilding America's infrastructure and creating economic opportunities.
