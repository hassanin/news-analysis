The White House Press Secretary released a statement in response to a report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The statement highlights that since the ACA was enacted, the private sector has added 8.1 million jobs, which is the strongest job growth in 45 months since the late 1990s. The statement refutes claims that the ACA negatively affects jobs, stating that there is no evidence that part-time employment has increased as a result of the ACA. The CBO report also suggests that the ACA will induce some employers to hire more workers or increase the hours of current employees in the short term, and in the long run, it will empower individuals to make choices about their lives and retire on time. The statement also argues that the ACA's impact on the labor force is incomplete, as the CBO did not consider the slowing health care cost growth and positive impacts on worker productivity, which experts estimate could add 250,000 to 400,000 jobs per year by the end of the decade. Additionally, the CBO confirms that the ACA is projected to reduce the deficit by more than $1 trillion over the next two decades. The statement concludes by criticizing the Republican plan to repeal the ACA, claiming it would strip hard-working Americans of opportunities provided by the law.
