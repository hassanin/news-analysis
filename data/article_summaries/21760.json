The United States and India are working together to enhance their cooperation on cyber issues. They have established a framework based on shared principles and intended forms of cooperation. These shared principles include a commitment to an open and secure cyberspace, promoting the free flow of information, cooperation between the private sector and government on cybercrime and cybersecurity, and respecting cultural diversity. The framework also emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in combating cyber threats and promoting cybersecurity.

The main areas of cooperation between the two countries include sharing and implementing cybersecurity best practices, exchanging information on cybersecurity threats, developing joint mechanisms to mitigate cyber threats, promoting cybersecurity research and development, and improving the capacity of law enforcement agencies to combat cybercrime. The framework also highlights the promotion of international law and voluntary norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, as well as cooperation on telecom security and supply chain integrity.

The United States and India will continue to support the multistakeholder model of Internet governance and engage in Internet governance forums. They will also work towards improving transnational cybercrime cooperation and strengthening critical Internet infrastructure in India. The complete framework is expected to be signed within 60 days.
