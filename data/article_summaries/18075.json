President Obama and Prime Minister Kan launched several new initiatives during their meeting at the Yokohama APEC Economic Leaders Meeting. These initiatives include the Energy-Smart Communities Initiative (ESCI), which aims to support energy-efficient buildings, transport, and electric power grids in the Asia-Pacific region. The initiative focuses on improving energy security, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and creating employment opportunities. The U.S.-Japan Clean Energy Policy Dialogue was also established to discuss policies related to clean energy technologies, such as electric vehicles and nuclear energy. Additionally, there were three economic policy dialogues aimed at strengthening economic ties between the United States and Japan. These dialogues focus on harmonizing approaches to facilitate trade, promoting innovation and job creation, and cooperation in the internet economy. Another important initiative is the U.S.-Japan Nuclear Security Working Group, which aims to identify and coordinate tangible outcomes for the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit. The group will focus on securing nuclear materials and promoting nuclear security, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, the U.S.-Japan Open Skies Agreement enters into force, ending restrictions on air travel between the two countries and improving scheduling, services, and prices for passengers and cargo.
