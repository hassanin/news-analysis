President Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 22, 2014, as National Maritime Day in the United States. The proclamation recognizes the important role that the men and women of the United States Merchant Marine have played in defending and delivering goods to the country. It also highlights their contributions to international aid efforts and their role in maintaining the country's supply lines. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to observe the day and display the American flag, and requests that ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
