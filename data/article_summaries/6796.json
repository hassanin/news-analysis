President Biden has signed an executive order on ensuring responsible innovation in digital assets. The order aims to promote responsible innovation and evolution of the digital asset ecosystem in order to protect national security, financial stability, economic competitiveness, and global leadership. The explosive growth of cryptocurrencies poses risks to Americans, businesses, the financial system, and national security if not properly regulated. However, digital assets also offer opportunities for innovation, competitiveness, and financial inclusion. The order directs relevant departments and agencies to research the merits of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) and assess the risks and benefits. It also calls for the development of a plan to mitigate the illicit finance and national security risks associated with digital assets. The U.S. government aims to maintain its leadership role in the global financial system and ensure the long-term strength of national security tools. The executive order recognizes the need for a comprehensive federal framework to govern digital assets and protect consumers, investors, and the integrity of the financial system. The government will work with industry, labor, consumer groups, and international allies to foster responsible innovation in the digital asset ecosystem. The executive order emphasizes the importance of addressing financial inclusion and improving the current financial system, which is slow, costly, and inaccessible for many Americans. The order sets an urgent timeline for reports and actions to be taken, but the specific regulations will depend on the recommendations provided by the reports. The executive order is not directly related to the current situation in Ukraine and has been in development for several months.
