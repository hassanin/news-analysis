The Obama Administration has announced several initiatives to help small businesses expand and create jobs. These initiatives include accelerating payments to small business subcontractors, supporting Section 179 expensing at $250,000 for one year, increasing access to capital through the Small Loan Advantage program, launching a streamlined application for surety bond guarantees, reducing paperwork for the Disaster Loan Program, and aligning the New Markets Tax Credit with the needs of investors in small businesses. These actions aim to make it easier for small businesses to access loans, tax credits, and government support, ultimately promoting economic growth and recovery.
