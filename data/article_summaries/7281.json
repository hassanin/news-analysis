The Republican Study Committee, representing a majority of House Republicans, has released a budget that targets Medicare, Social Security, and Americans' access to health coverage and prescription drugs. They aim to repeal President Biden's power to negotiate lower drug costs, address rapid drug price increases, and cap the price of insulin for Medicare beneficiaries. Additionally, they want to raise the retirement age for Social Security, despite previously pledging not to do so. The budget also includes cuts to the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, potentially leaving millions without healthcare coverage and ending protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Alongside these cuts, House Republicans are proposing $5 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. President Biden, on the other hand, is focused on growing the economy by investing in America and the middle class. The MAGA proposal, in contrast, prioritizes the wealthy and corporations, threatening the economic progress made in the past two and a half years.
