In this proclamation, issued by President Donald Trump on September 25, 2019, the United States government declares that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism and that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including its Qods Force, supports and engages in terrorism. The proclamation states that Iran arbitrarily detains U.S. citizens, contributes to humanitarian crises, threatens its neighbors, engages in destructive cyberattacks, and poses a threat to international shipping. As a result, the United States has determined that it is in their interest to restrict and suspend the entry of senior government officials of Iran, as well as their immediate family members, into the United States. The proclamation cites sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act as the authority for taking this action. The Secretary of State and Secretary of Homeland Security are delegated the authority to implement this proclamation and establish the procedures for its enforcement. The proclamation includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents of the United States, individuals granted asylum or refugee status, and individuals determined by the Secretary of State to further important U.S. law enforcement objectives. The proclamation will remain in effect until the Secretary of State determines that it is no longer necessary.
