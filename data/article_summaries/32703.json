The article discusses President Trump's efforts to roll back regulations and the positive impact it has had on American families and businesses. The Trump Administration has cut nearly eight regulations for every new significant regulation, exceeding the goal set by Executive Order 13771. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that this approach to regulation will raise real incomes by over $3,100 per household per year and save consumers and businesses over $220 billion per year. Additionally, the deregulation of vehicles is expected to reduce the price of a new vehicle by $2,200 by 2026. These deregulatory actions are projected to increase the real incomes of Americans by $53 billion per year from 2021 to 2029. The article also highlights research by Casey Mulligan, former Chief Economist at the CEA, which shows that overturning the President's deregulatory rules and imposing a ban on fracking would negatively impact the financial health of Americans in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution. The deregulation of industries such as shale, prescription drugs, and internet access has significantly benefited low-income households. The article concludes by stating that President Trump's commitment to reducing anti-growth measures will continue to benefit all Americans, particularly the most vulnerable.
