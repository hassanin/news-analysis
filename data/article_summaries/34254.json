The American economy is strong and manufacturing jobs are growing steadily. Jobs in goods-producing industries, including manufacturing, have recently grown at the fastest rate since President Reagan was in office. There are currently 6.9 million open jobs across the nation, the highest number on record. However, there is a shortage of skilled workers in many industries, particularly in manufacturing, where there are 500,000 open jobs. One contributing factor to the shortage is the opioid epidemic, which has caused many Americans to leave the workforce. Communities hit hardest by opioid addiction have lower labor force participation rates. Treatment for opioid use disorder, including medication-assisted treatment and ongoing behavioral therapy, is available and can help individuals rejoin the workforce. The Department of Labor has awarded pilot project grants to help communities fight the opioid crisis and provide new skills to workers affected by the epidemic. It is important for individuals and communities to play a role in preventing drug misuse, promoting treatment, and supporting addiction recovery.
