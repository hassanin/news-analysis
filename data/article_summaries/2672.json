The Biden administration has released its National Security Strategy, which focuses on two key challenges: competition between major powers and transnational challenges. The strategy emphasizes the need to invest in American power and influence, build strong coalitions, and set rules for the 21st century. It recognizes the competition with China as a major challenge but also highlights the importance of cooperation and engagement with all countries. The strategy also addresses the war in Ukraine and the need to support Ukraine, impose costs on Russia, and strengthen alliances. In terms of trade, the strategy calls for a new model that addresses issues like supply chains, labor standards, and the role of technology. The strategy also discusses the role of nuclear weapons and the need to reduce their role in American strategy. The President is reevaluating the relationship with Saudi Arabia and will consult with Congress on how to proceed. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of foreign policy for the middle class and how it can benefit American workers.
