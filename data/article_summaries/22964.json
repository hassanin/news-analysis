The article discusses the UAW's support for a tax and unemployment insurance legislation that was reached between the White House and Republican leadership. The UAW is pleased with the extension of unemployment benefits, which will restore benefits to 800,000 laid off workers and prevent an additional six million workers from losing benefits next year. The UAW believes that this extension will create 600,000 jobs in 2011. The article also mentions the stimulative tax breaks for working families included in the compromise, such as a two percent payroll tax holiday and extensions of various tax credits. However, the UAW is disappointed with the inclusion of tax cuts for the wealthy, which they believe could be better spent on creating jobs or extending unemployment insurance. Despite this, the UAW believes that the agreement will provide much-needed support to working families, displaced workers, low-income Americans, and the nation's economy.
