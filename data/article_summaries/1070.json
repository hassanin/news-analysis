President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency declared in Proclamation 7463, in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, will continue for an additional year. The President has determined that the terrorist threat that led to the initial declaration still persists, and therefore it is necessary to extend the national emergency beyond September 14, 2023.
