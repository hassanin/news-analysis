Senate Democrats have proposed a balanced plan to avoid budget cuts that will negatively impact children, seniors, and military personnel. The plan includes spending cuts that will not harm middle-class families, while also closing tax loopholes that benefit the wealthiest individuals. Republicans in Congress now have to choose between protecting investments in education, healthcare, and national defense or prioritizing and protecting tax loopholes that benefit a few at the expense of middle and working-class Americans. The American people overwhelmingly support the approach Senate Democrats are taking, particularly the "Buffett Rule," which ensures that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes. It is unacceptable that the richest individuals pay a smaller portion of their income in taxes than their secretaries and other middle-class workers. The hope is that Congressional Republicans will reconsider their insistence on burdening the middle class and seniors with the sole responsibility of reducing the deficit. President Obama has emphasized that a thriving and rising middle class is essential for a strong economy and a strong America.
