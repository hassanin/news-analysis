The article is a statement of administration policy on H.R. 244, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The administration appreciates the bill's funding for the military, including $21 billion of the requested $30 billion for defeating ISIS and rebuilding the armed forces. The bill represents a $25.7 billion increase in defense funding over FY 2016 levels and includes investments in readiness, equipment, and troop pay. The administration supports additional funding for stopping human and drug trafficking and enforcing immigration laws, but is concerned about the lack of fiscal restraint and the lack of reforms to Puerto Rico's healthcare system. The administration also supports school choice, protections for the sanctity of life, and the Second Amendment. If the bill were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he sign it into law. The administration looks forward to working with Congress on the FY 2018 appropriations process.
