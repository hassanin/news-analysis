In this statement, it is claimed that President Trump has done nothing wrong and that the Democrats' impeachment proceedings are illegitimate and harmful to the American people. The statement criticizes the Democrats for focusing on impeachment instead of addressing important issues such as reducing gun violence, passing the USMCA, improving healthcare, lowering prescription drug costs, securing the southern border, and modernizing infrastructure. It accuses Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Schiff, and the Democrats of conducting secret meetings and blocking the Administration's participation, leading to a lack of due process. The statement argues that the Democrats want to render a verdict without giving the Administration a chance to defend itself, which is deemed unfair, unconstitutional, and un-American.
