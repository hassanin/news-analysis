Vice President Joe Biden announced that investing in the country's infrastructure will create 400,000 jobs nationwide over the next two years. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan includes a $100 billion investment in roads, bridges, and mass transit systems, the largest increase in infrastructure funding since the 1950s. In Maryland, this investment will provide $400 million for highway improvements, $100 million for transit systems, and $150 million for water and sewer projects. Overall, the plan aims to create or save 3 to 4 million jobs, spend 75% of the package in the first 18 months, double renewable energy capacity, computerize health records, and upgrade 10,000 schools. In Maryland specifically, the plan is expected to create or save 70,000 jobs and provide tax cuts for workers.
