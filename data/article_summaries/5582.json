The Biden administration held a press call to discuss their winter preparedness plan for COVID-19. The call was conducted on background and embargoed until the following morning. The plan focuses on making it easier for Americans to access vaccines, tests, and treatments, supporting states and communities with resources, protecting high-risk individuals in nursing homes, and monitoring the Omicron variant. The administration announced that starting tomorrow, each household can order four at-home tests for free from COVIDTests.gov. They also emphasized the importance of masks as part of their strategy. The administration assured that they have sufficient supply of Paxlovid, an oral antiviral treatment, and are looking into expanding the arsenal of tools, including monoclonal antibodies, for immunocompromised individuals. The funding for the tests came from the American Rescue Plan (ARP). The administration is committed to reaching vulnerable populations and is working with states to provide support and resources. The call concluded with a reminder that the press call was embargoed until the morning.
