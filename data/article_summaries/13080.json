The United States expresses concern over the detention of Russian citizens participating in peaceful rallies supporting Article 31 of the Russian Constitution, which guarantees the right to peaceful assembly. The US emphasizes the importance of embracing and protecting universal values, including freedom of expression and assembly, as stated in the Russian Constitution and international agreements. These freedoms are not only important for political systems but also for economic modernization and prosperity. The US believes that without freedom of assembly, genuine competition during Russia's upcoming parliamentary elections in December will be impossible.
