This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the national emergency with respect to the Central African Republic will continue. The national emergency was declared on May 12, 2014, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat posed by the breakdown of law and order, sectarian tension, widespread violence and atrocities, and the use of child soldiers in the Central African Republic. The situation still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, so the national emergency will remain in effect beyond May 12, 2016. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
