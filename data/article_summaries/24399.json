The Obama administration has released its budget for the 2016 fiscal year. The budget includes proposals for infrastructure spending, tax reform, and investments in education and healthcare. The budget aims to reduce the deficit, stabilize the debt, and invest in middle-class families. The budget also proposes ending sequestration and increasing discretionary spending. The budget includes $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction, primarily from health tax and comprehensive immigration reform. The budget also focuses on reducing healthcare costs and raising revenue from high-income tax expenditures. The budget projects economic growth of 3 percent per year in 2015 and 2016. The administration hopes that the budget will spur bipartisan negotiations and lead to common-sense budgeting proposals that benefit middle-class families.
