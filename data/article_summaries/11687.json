President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation to the Congress regarding the restoration of Burma's trade benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The proclamation states that Burma will be designated as a beneficiary developing country and a least-developed beneficiary developing country for the GSP program. The proclamation also modifies the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) of the United States to reflect these changes. The modifications will be effective 60 days after the date of the proclamation. Any previous proclamations or Executive Orders that are inconsistent with these actions are superseded.
