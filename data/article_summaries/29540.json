President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared in Executive Order 12170 in 1979, will continue beyond November 14, 2019. The President believes that relations with Iran have not yet normalized and the process of implementing agreements with Iran from 1981 is still ongoing. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
