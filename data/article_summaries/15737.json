National Security Advisor General James Jones issued a statement condemning the disclosure of classified information by Wikileaks. He expressed concern that the leaked documents could endanger American lives and national security. He also noted that the United States government was not contacted by Wikileaks prior to the release of the documents. Despite the leaks, the United States remains committed to deepening partnerships with Afghanistan and Pakistan, defeating common enemies, and supporting the aspirations of the Afghan and Pakistani people. The leaked documents reportedly cover a period from January 2004 to December 2009. General Jones emphasized that the United States has implemented a new strategy in Afghanistan to address the challenges faced in the region. He highlighted the importance of preventing Afghanistan from sliding backward, as it could allow violent extremist groups like al Qaeda to regain strength. The United States has been working closely with Pakistan in counter-terrorism efforts, resulting in significant blows to al Qaeda's leadership. However, General Jones stressed the need for Pakistan to continue its strategic shift against insurgent groups and for the balance to shift decisively against al Qaeda and its allies. The United States will continue to support Pakistan in rooting out violent extremists and supporting the aspirations of the Pakistani people.
