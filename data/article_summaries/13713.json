President Obama is hosting an "Insourcing American Jobs" forum at the White House to discuss the increasing trend of companies bringing jobs back to the United States. The President will encourage companies to invest in America and create jobs. In the coming weeks, he will propose new tax proposals to reward companies that invest or bring back jobs to the United States and eliminate tax advantages for companies moving jobs overseas. The forum will also focus on ways to encourage companies to insource American jobs and help rebuild the economy. The White House released a report highlighting the trend of insourcing and how it benefits the United States. The President will also propose increasing resources for the SelectUSA program, which promotes and facilitates U.S. investment in partnership with states. The administration has taken other steps to incentivize insourcing, such as supporting small businesses through the SBA's International Trade Loan program and promoting investment in priority countries through a partnership between the Commerce Department and the State Department. Several companies attending the forum have already brought jobs back to the United States or made significant investments in the country.
