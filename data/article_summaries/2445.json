President Biden has established the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, overseen by Vice President Kamala Harris, with the goal of reducing gun violence. The office is responsible for enhancing partnerships between the federal government and cities/states to address gun violence. Vice President Harris is launching the Safer States Initiative, which aims to provide states with tools and support to combat gun violence. The initiative includes the release of the Biden-Harris Safer States Agenda, which outlines key actions states should take. The Justice Department is also announcing two executive actions to reduce gun violence. The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention will continue to work with states to provide resources and support for implementing the agenda.
