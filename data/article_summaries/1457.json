President Clinton designated the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in 1996, marking a significant moment for conservation in the United States. It was the first time a President designated a national monument under the Antiquities Act to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The monument encompasses a diverse range of natural and cultural resources, including varied geology, rich human history, outstanding biological resources, and opportunities for scientific research. Over the years, the Congress adjusted the boundaries of the monument, increasing its reservation by more than 180,000 acres. However, in 2017, President Trump issued a proclamation to reduce the monument by over 860,000 acres. This decision was challenged in federal court. President Biden's proclamation seeks to restore the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to its original size and boundaries, ensuring the protection of its exceptional resources for future generations. The proclamation highlights the importance of preserving the natural and scientific values of the monument and its role as an outdoor laboratory for scientific research. It also emphasizes the cultural and historic significance of the monument, including its importance to Tribal Nations. The proclamation directs the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and maintain a new management plan for the monument, with input from stakeholders and tribal communities. Livestock grazing and emergency response activities will continue within the monument, but unauthorized activities that harm the monument's features are prohibited.
