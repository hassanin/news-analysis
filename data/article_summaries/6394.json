President Biden addressed a group of local officials at the Marriott Marquis in Washington, D.C., highlighting the importance of their leadership and the significant role they play in guiding and serving their communities. He praised the American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law one year ago, for providing crucial support to local governments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan helped millions of Americans put food on the table, keep a roof over their heads, and provided a much-needed boost to the economy. Biden emphasized that the plan was designed to bring everyone along and ensure that no one is left behind. He also spoke about the importance of infrastructure investment and the potential for job creation and economic growth. He highlighted the need to invest in American manufacturing and create more pathways to good-paying jobs through apprenticeship programs and training. Biden acknowledged the challenges of rising prices, particularly in areas like gas and home heating, but attributed them to disruptions in the supply chain caused by the pandemic and geopolitical factors. He reassured the audience that his administration is working to address these issues and improve the standard of living for working families. Biden also stressed the importance of fairness in the tax system, calling for corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share. He expressed confidence in the ability of local officials to make a difference in their communities and urged them to continue advocating for the needs of their constituents. The speech concluded with a call to action, encouraging everyone to spread faith and work together to build a better America.
