This is a presidential memorandum from June 11, 2012, titled "Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012." The memorandum states that the President, after considering various factors including global economic conditions and increased oil production by certain countries, has determined that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran.

The President will closely monitor the situation to ensure that the market can continue to accommodate this reduction. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. The memorandum is signed by Barack Obama.
