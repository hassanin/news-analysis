President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has vetoed H.J. Res. 27, a resolution that aimed to disapprove the revised definition of "Waters of the United States." The revised definition, which was implemented in 2023, establishes clear boundaries for protected bodies of water under the Clean Water Act. President Biden argues that this definition is necessary to promote infrastructure projects, economic investments, and agricultural activities while safeguarding water quality and public health. He believes that the resolution would create uncertainty and hinder economic growth, particularly in agriculture and downstream communities. The vetoed resolution would also have a negative impact on millions of households that rely on healthy wetlands and streams. Therefore, President Biden has chosen to veto the resolution.
