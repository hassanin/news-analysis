President Joe Biden has written a letter to the Speaker of the House requesting fiscal year 2022 emergency supplemental funding for Ukraine. The request amounts to $33.0 billion and aims to provide critical security and economic assistance to Ukraine. The funding would include additional security assistance to supply equipment to Ukraine's military and police, economic assistance to support the government in responding to the crisis and providing citizen services, and food security and humanitarian assistance to address food shortages and aid those affected by the war. The request also includes funding to support the production of United States food crops that are experiencing a global shortage due to the war in Ukraine, as well as measures to increase domestic production of strategic minerals and materials. In addition to the funding request, the President's administration is sending a proposal to enhance the United States' ability to hold Russia accountable financially for its invasion of Ukraine. Finally, President Biden urges Congress to promptly provide the $22.5 billion requested earlier for COVID-19 response, stating that without additional funding, the country is unable to purchase life-saving treatments and vaccines, which could lead to further supply chain disruptions and the spread of new variants. The President emphasizes the need for Congress to address these critical needs promptly and designates the requested amounts as an emergency requirement.
