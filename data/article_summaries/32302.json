The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) under President Donald Trump has built a team of over 50 staff members to advise the President on science and technology (S&T) and coordinate S&T efforts across the Executive Branch. The OSTP policy advisors are working on various topics such as advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, cybersecurity, healthcare, and telecommunications, among others. The Trump Administration has shown a commitment to advancing technological development, conducting research and development (R&D), and ensuring national security. The President's FY 2018 budget request includes a 2% increase in federal R&D investment, and the administration has prioritized basic and early-stage applied research for FY 2019. The OSTP has also been involved in initiatives to improve government services and promote innovation, including hosting the American Leadership in Emerging Technology Summit and participating in international events to promote the free flow of data and collaboration on scientific initiatives. The OSTP has also established a new committee to address policies related to tech transfer, infrastructure utilization, open data, and workforce development.
