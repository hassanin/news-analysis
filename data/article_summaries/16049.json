This article discusses the Joint Understanding for the Start Follow On Treaty, which was agreed upon by the President of the United States and the President of the Russian Federation in 2009. The treaty aimed to further reduce and limit the nations' strategic offensive arms and replace the existing START Treaty with a new legally binding agreement. The treaty outlined several provisions, including the reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms, provisions for calculating these limits, definitions, data exchanges, notifications, inspections, and verification procedures. It also addressed the interrelationship between strategic offensive and defensive arms, the impact of non-nuclear intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles on strategic stability, basing of strategic offensive arms on national territories, and the establishment of an implementation body. The treaty was set to have a duration of ten years, unless it was superseded by a subsequent treaty on the reduction of strategic offensive arms. The Presidents instructed their negotiators to complete the treaty promptly for signing and ratification in their respective countries.
