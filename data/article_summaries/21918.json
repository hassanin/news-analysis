President Obama has announced the final rules to better protect service members from financial abuse on the fifth anniversary of signing Wall Street Reform into law. The Department of Defense is finalizing updated Military Lending Act rules that close harmful loopholes to protect troops and their families from predatory lending. These rules expand consumer protections for service members and their families by closing loopholes in the definition of "consumer credit" covered by the MLA and extending the Act's protections to more loans. The rules define "consumer credit" to include all payday loans, vehicle title loans, refund anticipation loans, deposit advance loans, installment loans, and credit cards extended to service members. They also count charges for most "add-on" products in calculating the military annual percentage rate. The rules aim to protect service members from predatory lending while preserving their access to credit. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will work with other federal regulators to ensure compliance with the new rules. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law in 2010, has strengthened consumer protections, made the financial system safer and more transparent, and provided regulators with effective tools. The President has emphasized the importance of protecting and building on these reforms. However, Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried to repeal Dodd-Frank and attack its provisions, but the President has vowed to veto any efforts to do so.
