First Lady Jill Biden has launched a new virtual tour of the White House on National Civics Day. The virtual tour, created in collaboration with the White House, Google Maps, and Google Arts & Culture, uses Google Street View technology. The tour can be accessed on WhiteHouse.gov/VirtualTour, as well as on Google Maps and the Google Arts & Culture page. The aim of the tour is to make the White House accessible to more people who may not be able to visit in person. The tour includes Spanish translation and audio captions for those with disabilities, narrated by White House Social Secretary Carlos Elizondo. The opening video of the virtual tour is the same as the one played at the White House Visitors Center, providing a similar experience for virtual visitors.
