On December 16, 1944, Nazi forces launched their last major offensive campaign on the Western Front of World War II, known as the Battle of the Bulge. The United States and Allied Forces fought bravely and ultimately achieved victory, liberating Europe from Nazi control. Over 500,000 soldiers faced unimaginable peril, with over 19,000 losing their lives in the fight against tyranny. Despite initial setbacks, American troops showed resilience and fought with dauntless fortitude. Led by revered military leaders and fueled by their indomitable spirit, they achieved what Winston Churchill called "undoubtedly the greatest American battle of the war." 75 years later, we honor the bravery of these heroes, whose sacrifices have left a legacy of proud service and devotion to country.
