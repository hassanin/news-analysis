During Second Chance Month, the President has pardoned three individuals who have shown dedication to rehabilitation and giving back to their communities. Additionally, the sentences of 75 people serving long terms for non-violent drug offenses are being commuted, many of whom have been on home confinement during the pandemic. The Administration is taking further steps to support the re-entry of individuals into society after incarceration, such as providing job training, grants for workforce development, increased opportunities to serve in the federal government, improved re-entry services for veterans, and more support for healthcare, housing, and education. The President believes that helping those who have served their time become productive members of their communities is an effective way to reduce recidivism and crime. The Administration will continue to review clemency petitions and work towards reforms that promote equity, justice, second chances, and the safety and well-being of all Americans.
