The theme for this year's celebration is "African Americans in Times of War," commemorating the 100th anniversary of the World War I armistice. President Donald Trump highlighted the military service of African Americans throughout American history in his proclamation for the month. Vice President Mike Pence visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture, while President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump hosted a reception to honor African American leaders at the White House. The article also mentions the founding of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH) in 1915, which was established to address the lack of histories and publications about African Americans.
