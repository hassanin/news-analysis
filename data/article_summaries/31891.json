President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation regarding the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which provides duty-free treatment for certain articles imported from designated beneficiary developing countries. The proclamation states that the President has decided to withdraw the duty-free treatment for certain articles from certain beneficiary developing countries, as these countries exported eligible articles in quantities that exceeded the applicable competitive-need limitations in 2017. However, the President has also determined that waivers of the competitive-need limitations are in the national economic interest of the United States, and therefore such waivers will be granted for certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries. Additionally, the proclamation mentions the redesignation of a country as a beneficiary developing country with respect to a certain eligible article. The proclamation also includes modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to reflect these changes. The modifications will be effective from November 1, 2018, onwards.
