This fact sheet outlines the economic benefits of fixing the broken immigration system in the US. The President's Immigration Accountability Executive actions aim to secure the border, hold undocumented immigrants accountable, and ensure everyone follows the same rules. These actions include cracking down on illegal immigration at the border, prioritizing the deportation of felons over families, and requiring certain undocumented immigrants to pass a criminal background check and pay taxes as they register to temporarily stay in the US. The President's actions are expected to boost economic output by 0.4 to 0.9 percent over ten years, corresponding to increases in GDP of $90 billion to $210 billion in 2024. The actions will increase the productivity of American workers by allowing undocumented workers to find jobs that match their skills, leading to wage increases for all workers. Additionally, high-skilled immigration will boost innovation and patenting in the American economy. The actions will also expand the American labor force by nearly 150,000 people over 10 years, leading to increased average wages for all workers. A bigger economy resulting from these actions will reduce the deficit, as tax revenues will increase, and the government will need to borrow less. The actions will also expand the country's tax base by allowing eligible individuals to work and pay taxes. However, it is noted that the economic benefits of these actions are not as strong as those under a bipartisan immigration reform bill. Independent studies show that commonsense immigration reform would significantly increase economic growth, reduce the deficit, and boost wages for native-born workers.
