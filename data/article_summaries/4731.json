The Biden-Harris Administration has released a strategic plan called "All In" with the goal of reducing homelessness by 25 percent by 2025. The plan aims to prevent homelessness, address inequities, and help cities and states reduce unsheltered homelessness. It builds on the "Housing First" model, which prioritizes providing housing as the first step towards stability. The plan also calls on state and local governments to set their own goals and use "All In" as a blueprint. The plan acknowledges that while homelessness remained relatively flat overall, the number of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, such as living in cars and tents, increased by 3%. Factors contributing to this include income inequality, rising rents, limited housing supply, the impact of the pandemic, criminalization of homelessness, and limited access to healthcare and job training. To address unsheltered homelessness, the White House and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness are launching a new initiative to partner with state and local governments.
