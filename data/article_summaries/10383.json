Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications and Assistant to the President Benjamin Rhodes held a meeting with representatives from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) focused on promoting human rights and democracy in Burma. During the meeting, Rhodes discussed the challenges facing reform in Burma and outlined the President's priorities for future engagement with the Burmese government. He emphasized the importance of addressing the humanitarian needs, rights, and status of the Rohingya community in Rakhine State, as well as other Muslim minority communities in Burma. Rhodes also highlighted the need for constitutional reforms that would transfer political power to a civilian-led, elected government, and ensure that the people of Burma can elect their leader. Additionally, he discussed ongoing ceasefire negotiations with ethnic nationalities, the 2015 elections, the establishment of a UN High Commissioner for Human Rights office in Burma, and concerns about media freedoms, protection of women's rights, and political prisoners.
