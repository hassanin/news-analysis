President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Minnesota and ordered Federal assistance to supplement recovery efforts in areas affected by a severe winter storm, straight-line winds, and flooding from March to April 2019. Federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in various counties and tribal communities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for funding. Steven W. Johnson has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
