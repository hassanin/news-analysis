The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new actions under its Federal Buy Clean Initiative in Toledo, Ohio, to promote the development of low-carbon construction materials made in America and support good-paying jobs. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan, and Deputy National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi made the announcement while visiting the Cleveland-Cliffs Direct Reduction steel plant in Toledo. The initiative aims to prioritize the purchase of key low carbon construction materials, covering 98% of materials purchased by the Federal Government. The Cleveland-Cliffs Direct Reduction steel plant produces a lower-carbon intermediary feedstock product used in various products purchased by the government. This initiative is part of President Biden's economic plan to boost American manufacturing. The Federal Government, as the largest direct purchaser in the world, leverages its purchasing power to support American manufacturing and accelerate innovation. The Biden-Harris Administration is expanding the Buy Clean Task Force to include additional agencies and is committed to rewarding companies that reduce carbon pollution and support American manufacturing jobs. The initiative also includes funding for the General Services Administration, Department of Transportation, and Environmental Protection Agency to designate and use construction materials with lower greenhouse gas emissions. The Department of Energy will receive funds for retrofitting industrial facilities and tax credits for clean technology manufacturing. The Buy Clean Task Force will continue to launch pilots, expand the scope of industrial pollutants and materials, engage with industry, and establish mechanisms for data collection and public disclosure.
