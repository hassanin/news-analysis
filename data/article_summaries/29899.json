The Office of Management and Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, issued a statement on the budgetary impact analysis for the executive order titled "Omnibus Report on Significant Trade Deficits". This executive order directs the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to prepare and submit a report identifying and assessing foreign trading partners with which the United States had a significant trade deficit in goods in 2016. The implementation of this executive order is expected to have a minimal impact on costs, revenues, and obligations to the Federal Government. The benefits of this executive order include the creation of a unified report that provides policy makers with up-to-date information on unfair trade practices and the causes of trade deficits. The Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative are the agencies expected to be impacted by this executive order.
