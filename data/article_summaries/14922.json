The Department of Labor (DOL) has issued final rules to make it easier for states to create retirement savings programs. Currently, many Americans reach retirement age without enough savings to supplement their Social Security checks, as they do not have access to a way to save for retirement at work. The DOL's final rule clarifies that state retirement savings programs are not subject to federal pension law, allowing more states to create their own programs. Eight states have already passed legislation to create their own retirement savings arrangements. The DOL is also proposing a rule that would allow larger cities to establish their own retirement savings programs. The goal is to ensure that all Americans have the ability to save for retirement at work.
