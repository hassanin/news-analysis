On June 12, 2009, President Barack Obama issued a message to Congress and a notice stating that the national emergency and related measures blocking the property of certain individuals in Belarus are to continue in effect beyond June 16, 2009. Despite some positive developments, such as the release of political prisoners, certain members of the Belarusian government and other individuals have undermined democratic processes, committed human rights abuses, and engaged in public corruption. These actions and policies pose a continuing threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and related measures.
