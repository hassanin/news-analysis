The electric vehicle maker VinFast has announced plans to build an electric vehicle and battery manufacturing facility in North Carolina. This $4 billion investment is expected to create over 7,000 jobs and produce hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles and batteries. This announcement is in line with the government's economic strategy, which aims to revitalize domestic manufacturing, create jobs, and strengthen supply chains. It builds on previous investments from companies like GM, Ford, and Siemens to invest in America. The government's efforts to build a clean energy economy are driving companies to manufacture more products in the country, leading to a reduction in costs for the American people. The government has already taken steps to support the electric vehicle industry, such as signing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to develop EV charging infrastructure and setting a goal of achieving a 50% electric vehicle sales share by 2030. Congress has the opportunity to further support these efforts through competitiveness legislation like the Bipartisan Innovation Act, which aims to create more jobs, boost domestic manufacturing, and lower prices for working families.
