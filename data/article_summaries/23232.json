The article announces that President Obama has instructed the National Security staff to conduct a 90-day study to develop a coordinated federal government strategy to support and engage military families. The study will involve nearly twenty federal agencies, including the White House's Domestic Policy Council and National Economic Council, as well as the offices of the Vice President, First Lady, and Dr. Biden. The study aims to designate strategic priorities for military families over the next ten years, examine public and private programs that positively support military families, integrate family-related issues into department priorities and budgets, identify opportunities for federal measures and programs to support state and local efforts, leverage the skills and experiences of military family members in national and community life, and strengthen mechanisms for military families to provide feedback on federal programs. The goal is to ensure that the US Armed Forces continue to recruit and retain high-level volunteers, maintain strong family ties while remaining prepared for service, enable civilian family members to reach their full potential while supporting military members, and promote understanding and support for military families within the general population. The announcement was made by First Lady Michelle Obama during a presentation at the National Military Family Association summit, where she discussed the challenges faced by military families and emphasized the need for a coordinated approach to support them.
