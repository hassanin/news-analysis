The White House condemns the arrest of nearly 50 pro-democracy activists by the Cuban government during funeral ceremonies for Oswaldo Paya. Some of the arrested individuals were reportedly beaten at the time of their detention. These arrests highlight the climate of repression in Cuba, as demonstrated by previous arrests of activists and arbitrary detentions. The White House calls on the Cuban government to respect fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of speech, and hopes for a future where the Cuban people can live in a free society.
