President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act aims to combat price gouging by pharmaceutical companies, particularly in relation to prescription drugs taken by over 750,000 seniors per year. The act requires these companies to pay rebates to Medicare for excessive price hikes, potentially saving seniors between $1 and $2,786 per dose of medication. The act also allows Medicare to directly negotiate lower prescription drug prices, caps the cost of insulin for Medicare beneficiaries at $35, provides free recommended adult vaccines, and requires drug companies to pay rebates if they raise prices faster than inflation. The administration is committed to lowering prescription drug costs and ensuring affordable healthcare for all Americans.
