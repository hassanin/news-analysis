The United States and Colombia have highlighted the importance of their bilateral relationship, particularly in terms of economic ties. They have announced that the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement will enter into force on May 15, 2012, offering opportunities for American manufacturers, service providers, farmers, ranchers, and workers. The agreement will expand U.S. goods exports by over $1.1 billion annually and provide duty-free access to all U.S. goods in various sectors. It is also expected to increase U.S. GDP by $2.5 billion and create additional U.S. jobs. The Obama Administration has worked with Colombia to address labor concerns through the "Action Plan Related to Labor Rights." Colombia's progress in implementing labor reform has resulted in tangible improvements and laid the foundation for improved labor rights in the country. The U.S. pledged support for Colombia's bid to join the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Additionally, President Obama announced the concession of 10-year validity visas to Colombia for tourism and business purposes. 

In terms of security, the two countries have engaged in discussions to deepen their security relationship. They have established an Action Plan on Regional Security Cooperation to support capacity-building for improved citizen security in the Western Hemisphere and West Africa.
