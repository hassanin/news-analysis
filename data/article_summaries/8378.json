White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki gave a briefing where she provided updates on President Biden's "Help Is Here" tour, which aims to communicate directly with Americans about how the Rescue Plan is helping them and their families. The President and other administration officials will be visiting various locations to highlight different aspects of the Rescue Plan, such as small business support, school reopening funding, and direct relief checks.

Psaki also announced that Gene Sperling will be joining the team to oversee the implementation of the Rescue Plan. Sperling has extensive experience in government and will work with various economic officials to ensure efficient and effective distribution of funds.

During the briefing, Psaki addressed questions about how Americans should use their stimulus checks, the Vatican's stance on same-sex unions, and the allegations against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. She also discussed the administration's efforts to address the situation at the southern border, boost vaccine distribution and uptake, and support voting rights.
