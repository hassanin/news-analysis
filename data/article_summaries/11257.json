President Obama has declared a major disaster for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe due to severe storms and flooding that occurred between May 25 and June 1, 2013. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement the Tribe's efforts in the affected area. Federal funding is available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Gary R. Stanley has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the Tribe and warranted by further damage assessments.
