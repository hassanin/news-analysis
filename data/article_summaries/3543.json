Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver remarks at a White House Summit on Wednesday, where over $40 billion in American Rescue Plan funds will be announced to strengthen and expand the workforce. The summit will highlight best practices from state and local leaders in workforce investment and call for more investments in the workforce from government officials and private sector leaders. The summit will focus on three major areas: building a diverse and skilled infrastructure workforce, strengthening the care and public health workforce, and expanding access to the workforce for underserved populations. The article provides examples of how American Rescue Plan funds are being utilized in various states and cities to invest in the workforce, such as supporting pre-apprenticeship programs, expanding training opportunities for direct care workers, and providing job training assistance for individuals facing barriers to employment. These investments have contributed to the record 9 million jobs added since President Biden took office.
