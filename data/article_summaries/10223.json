The Obama Administration has announced new actions to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure in the US. The actions include the designation of 48 national EV charging corridors on highways, covering nearly 25,000 miles in 35 states. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has also received commitments from 28 states, utilities, vehicle manufacturers and change organizations to accelerate the deployment of EV charging infrastructure on the DOT’s corridors. Additionally, 24 state and local governments have committed to increasing the procurement of EVs in their fleets. The Department of Energy (DOE) is conducting two studies to evaluate the optimal national EV charging deployment scenarios. Furthermore, 38 new businesses, non-profits, universities and utilities have signed on to the DOE’s Workplace Charging Challenge, committing to provide EV charging access for their workforce. These actions build on existing programs across multiple government departments and private sector collaborations to scale up EVs and fueling infrastructure.
