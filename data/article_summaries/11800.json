The White House is submitting legislation to Congress for the ratification of four key treaties related to nuclear security. These treaties are crucial in securing nuclear materials and preventing nuclear terrorism worldwide. The legislation includes implementing the 2005 Amendment to the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, the 2005 Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, and the 2005 Protocol to the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf. The submission of this legislation comes on the first anniversary of the Nuclear Security Summit convened by President Obama, during which 47 world leaders committed to securing all nuclear material globally. The leaders called for all nations to accept and implement these treaties, and 19 countries have ratified them since. The proposed legislation aims to update the U.S. Criminal Code to enhance the ability to investigate and prosecute acts of nuclear terrorism. The White House urges Congress to pass these bills quickly so that the United States can fully ratify the treaties and continue leading the global effort to prevent terrorists from obtaining deadly weapons.
