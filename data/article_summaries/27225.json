President Donald J. Trump has authorized an increase in federal funding for emergency protective measures in California due to the wildfires that began on October 8, 2017. Under the major disaster declaration issued in October, federal funding was made available at 75% of the eligible costs. However, President Trump has now authorized a 100% federal cost share for emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance, for a period of 30 days.
