The Trump Administration has completed nearly 400 miles of new border wall system, while also cracking down on violent criminals, illegal drug trafficking, and loopholes that aid human smugglers. The refugee system, which was originally meant to provide temporary refuge for victims of war and persecution, had turned into a lucrative industry, benefiting resettlement experts and slumlords at the expense of American communities. The Trump Administration's efforts, including the construction of the border wall, have led to a 70% drop in apprehensions for illegal immigration between May and August. Law enforcement has also seized significant amounts of illegal drugs. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf attributes this progress to President Trump's vision and the hard work of various agencies. Illegal immigration has negative consequences, empowering criminals, funding human smugglers, and supporting transnational gangs. It hinders legal immigrants and U.S. citizens from achieving the American Dream, endangers law enforcement officers, destabilizes communities, and puts law-abiding workers and businesses at a disadvantage. Open borders would exacerbate these problems and erode trust in the government. A safe and strong country requires a secure and robust immigration system.
