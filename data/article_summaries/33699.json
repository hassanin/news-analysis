The Trump Administration has been promoting the use of telehealth as part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth allows patients to connect remotely with medical professionals, and its use has increased due to advances in technology and recent policy changes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released guidance allowing Medicare to pay for telehealth services across the country, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that it will not impose penalties for noncompliance with HIPAA rules in connection with telehealth. The recent increase in telehealth utilization is likely due to a combination of factors, including policy changes, the CARES Act, and private insurance reimbursement policies. Telehealth has helped to slow the spread of COVID-19 by facilitating social distancing and reducing the demand for in-person care. It also has the potential to expand access to healthcare for individuals with limited physical access, reduce costs, and decrease the time it takes to seek medical expertise. The HHS is prioritizing further telehealth adoption and has launched a government portal and provided funding to support the expansion of telehealth services. However, further analysis is needed to determine the best telehealth framework for post-COVID-19 healthcare and to address issues such as appropriateness of treatments for telehealth, fraud prevention, and economic implications. Overall, telehealth has proven to be a valuable tool in meeting patients' healthcare needs during the pandemic and has the potential to offer long-term benefits.
