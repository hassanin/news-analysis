In 2021, over 248,500 Americans have been diagnosed with prostate cancer. It is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. Prostate cancer often goes undetected until later stages, making awareness and early detection crucial. Risk factors include age (especially men over 65), family history of prostate cancer, and Black men who have a higher chance of developing the disease. The National Cancer Institute is funding research to advance prevention and treatment of prostate cancer, particularly in understanding why it disproportionately affects Black men. The Affordable Care Act provides important protections for men with prostate cancer, including prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions. President Biden is committed to advancing research and funding to fight cancer, including prostate cancer, and is working to create an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. He has proclaimed September 2021 as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, encouraging awareness, prevention, and a cure for the disease.
