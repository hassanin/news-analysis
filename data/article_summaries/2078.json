Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer recently had a conversation with Prime Minister Albin Kurti of Kosovo. During the discussion, Mr. Finer expressed the United States' concern about the tense situation in northern Kosovo and called on all parties involved to take steps to de-escalate the situation. He specifically urged the Government of Kosovo to allow newly elected mayors to carry out their duties from alternative locations and to withdraw police forces from municipal buildings. Mr. Finer also appreciated Prime Minister Kurti's willingness to work towards conditions for new elections. Furthermore, he emphasized that the United States expects both sides to re-engage in the EU-facilitated Dialogue and to fully implement the normalization agreement reached in Brussels and Ohrid earlier this year.
