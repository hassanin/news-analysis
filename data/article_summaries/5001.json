The Supreme Court has granted a stay in the case of Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, which is seen as a win for reproductive freedom. This decision ensures continued access to mifepristone, a medication that has been approved by the FDA for over 20 years. The administration is committed to preserving access to essential medication and supporting the FDA's authority to approve safe and effective drugs. The President and Vice President will continue to defend a woman's right to make decisions about her own body and access reproductive healthcare, including medication abortion. The statement emphasizes the importance of not allowing lower court decisions that undermine the FDA's scientific judgment to put FDA-approved medications at risk. The administration believes that no one should come between a woman and her doctor when it comes to reproductive healthcare.
