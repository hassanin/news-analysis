The Vice President expressed concerns about the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade, a decision that has protected a woman's right to make decisions about her own body for almost 50 years. He argued that this would be an extreme step backward and a threat to all Americans, as it would open the door to restricting other rights such as contraception and same-sex marriage. The Vice President highlighted the importance of the right to privacy in personal decisions and emphasized that this issue is about the future of the nation. He also mentioned the passing of an extreme abortion ban in Oklahoma and the impact of such laws on women's rights. The Vice President expressed his commitment to fighting for women's health, safety, and wellbeing, and called for collaboration to ensure access to healthcare for women in all states.
