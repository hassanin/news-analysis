In a recent conversation held in the Vice President's ceremonial office, the Vice President expressed concerns about the potential implications of the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade. The Vice President emphasized the principles of freedom, liberty, and self-determination that our nation was founded on, and how these principles are at stake with the leaked draft opinion on the decision. The Vice President stated that the constitutional right to privacy, specifically the right to make personal decisions without government interference, is at risk. If Roe is overturned, states could have the power to interfere in personal decisions, leading to potential issues with data privacy, IVF restrictions, and the restriction of certain types of contraception. The Vice President also mentioned that overturning Roe could open the door to challenges on other fundamental rights, such as the right to use contraception and same-sex marriage. The Vice President noted the ideological perspective of some state legislatures, as seen in the passing of trigger ban laws and restrictions on trans rights, gay rights, and voting rights. The Vice President emphasized the importance of educating and informing the American people about the potential consequences of the Supreme Court's decision.
