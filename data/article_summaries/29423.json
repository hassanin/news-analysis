This Presidential Memorandum, issued on August 29, 2020, extends the use of the National Guard to respond to COVID-19 and facilitate economic recovery. The memorandum states that the United States will continue to cooperate with and assist states and territories in battling the spread of COVID-19, especially as the country transitions to increased economic activity. The National Guard has provided critical support to governors in addressing the needs of vulnerable populations, such as those in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The memorandum directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fund an additional 25% of emergency assistance activities in the State of Louisiana, which has been hit by both COVID-19 and Hurricane Laura. This additional funding will bring the federal cost share for Louisiana to 100%. The memorandum also establishes that the additional 25% federal cost share will be available until September 30, 2020, for orders authorizing duty that complies with health protection protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or other agreed-upon health protection measures. The memorandum concludes by stating that it does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States. The Secretary of Defense is directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
