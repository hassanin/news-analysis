President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 will continue beyond December 20, 2020. The emergency was initially declared on December 20, 2017, due to the prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption originating outside the United States. Trump believes that these issues pose a significant threat to international political and economic systems, as they undermine stability, security, and functioning societies. Human rights abuse and corruption have devastating impacts on individuals, weaken democratic institutions, degrade the rule of law, perpetuate violent conflicts, facilitate dangerous activities, undermine economic markets, and pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, Trump has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
