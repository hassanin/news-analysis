President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Lebanon, which was declared in Executive Order 13441 in 2007, is to continue beyond August 1, 2018. This decision is based on ongoing activities, such as Iran's arms transfers to Hizballah, which undermine Lebanese sovereignty and pose a threat to US national security and foreign policy.
