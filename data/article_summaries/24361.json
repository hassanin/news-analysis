The article discusses the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, which was established in 2012 to address food security and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. The alliance involves partnerships between African governments, development partners, and private companies to implement country food security strategies and promote inclusive agriculture-led economic growth. In its first year, the New Alliance leveraged over $3.7 billion in private investment in African agriculture. The alliance has also expanded to include Benin, Malawi, and Nigeria, in addition to existing members. The US government has been a strong advocate for nutrition, particularly during the critical 1,000 days from a woman's pregnancy to her child's second birthday. US commitments to nutrition extend beyond the New Alliance and include other programs such as Feed the Future. Over the last year, Feed the Future has reached over 12 million children through nutrition programs and has helped 7 million farmers adopt improved technologies or management practices. The US government has nearly doubled nutrition funding and tripled agriculture funding since 2008, with the goal of reducing stunting by 20 percent in the areas where Feed the Future works. US efforts also support the World Health Assembly goal to reduce childhood stunting by 40 percent by 2025.
