This article is a memorandum issued by former President Barack Obama regarding job-driven training for workers. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of providing workers with the skills they need to pursue in-demand jobs and careers in order to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class. Despite recent employment growth, many individuals still struggle to find jobs or increase their earnings, and businesses face challenges in hiring workers with the right skills. The memorandum calls for a government-wide review of federal programs to ensure they are designed to meet the needs of employers and workers. It directs the Secretaries of Labor, Commerce, and Education to develop a specific action plan within 180 days to make the workforce and training system more job-driven, integrated, and effective. The plan should focus on imparting relevant skills, making programs more accessible, and increasing accountability for positive employment and earning outcomes. The memorandum also highlights the need for better alignment across education and training sectors, improved information sharing, and the promotion of regional partnerships. The Secretaries are instructed to consult with various stakeholders and review existing evidence to inform the development of the action plan. The memorandum concludes with general provisions and instructions for publication.
