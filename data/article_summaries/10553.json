President Barack Obama has issued a message to the Congress of the United States regarding the annual renewal of the national emergency in Côte d'Ivoire. He states that the situation in or in relation to Côte d'Ivoire, which has been addressed by the United Nations Security Council, continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and related measures blocking the property of certain individuals contributing to the conflict in Côte d'Ivoire. The national emergency was initially declared in 2006 and is set to continue beyond February 7, 2011.
