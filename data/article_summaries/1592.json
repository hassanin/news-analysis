Vice President Kamala Harris visited Thomas Elementary School in Washington, D.C. to announce the Biden-Harris Action Plan for Building Better School Infrastructure. The plan aims to improve the learning environment for public school children across the nation by addressing issues such as outdated heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, poor indoor air quality, and the need for repairs and upgrades to school buildings. The Department of Energy is launching a $500 million grant program to help public schools invest in energy upgrades, including improvements to HVAC systems, installation of energy-efficient windows and solar panels, and better insulation. These grants will not only improve the learning environment but also save schools money on energy costs. Additionally, the plan includes funding for safer walking and biking routes to school and investments in electrifying school buses to reduce students' exposure to toxic fumes. Harris emphasized the importance of investing in the future of young leaders and ensuring they have every opportunity to succeed and thrive.
