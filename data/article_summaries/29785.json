President Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force have issued new guidelines to help protect Americans during the global Coronavirus outbreak. The recommendations include practicing strict personal hygiene, washing hands regularly, and wiping down surfaces in the home often. Even if you are young and healthy, you are still at risk and can increase the risk of contracting the virus for others. President Trump declared a National Emergency in response to the Coronavirus, freeing up more than $42 billion in resources for states and localities. The emergency declaration will give healthcare providers the flexibility they need to respond. President Trump is cutting through unnecessary red tape and making every federal resource available. The Vice President expressed gratitude for the partnership with governors and the response of the American people.
