President Obama has signed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act into law. The law authorizes funding for water projects across the country, including initiatives to restore watersheds, improve waterways and flood control, and enhance drinking water infrastructure. It also provides $170 million in funding for communities facing drinking water emergencies, with a focus on helping Flint, Michigan recover from its lead contamination crisis. The act also includes provisions for resolving long-standing water rights claims for Native American tribes, addressing their needs and promoting economic development. In relation to California's drought, the law invests in various water projects to promote water storage and supply, flood control, desalination, and water recycling. Additionally, it includes short-term provisions governing the operations of federal and state water projects under the Endangered Species Act for up to five years, regardless of drought conditions. The Obama administration has worked closely with the state of California and other stakeholders to address the state's water challenges while considering the needs of water users and endangered species. The president interprets and understands the law to require the continued application and implementation of the Endangered Species Act, in line with the cooperative efforts between federal agencies and California to meet state water quality standards. This interpretation is crucial for maintaining cooperation and commitment to addressing the complex interests related to California water.
