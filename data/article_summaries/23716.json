In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims the boundary enlargement of the California Coastal National Monument. The monument was originally established by President Clinton in 2000 to protect the biological treasures situated offshore on islands, rocks, reefs, and pinnacles within 12 nautical miles of the shoreline of California. The monument is home to significant populations of seabirds and marine mammals and provides habitat for breeding seabirds and forage and breeding habitat for sea lions and sea otters. The addition of the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands as the first shoreline unit of the monument would expand its boundaries to include coastal bluffs, tide pools, dunes, prairies, riverbanks, and the mouth and estuary of the Garcia River. These lands have significant scientific importance and support a diverse range of wildlife, including harbor seals, Steller sea lions, elephant seals, and various bird species. The lands also have cultural and archeological significance, with evidence of human habitation and prehistoric lifeways. The proclamation reserves approximately 1,665 acres of federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the Point Arena-Stornetta Unit of the monument. The Secretary of the Interior will manage the unit through the Bureau of Land Management to protect the identified objects of scientific and historic interest. Motorized vehicle use in the unit will be restricted to designated roads, and non-motorized mechanized vehicle use will be permitted on designated roads and trails. The proclamation does not affect the rights of any Indian tribe or the jurisdiction and authority of the State of California. Unauthorized persons are warned not to appropriate, injure, destroy, or remove any feature of the monument.
