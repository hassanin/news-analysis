The article discusses the efforts made by President Obama and his administration to support veterans' employment and reemployment in the federal workforce. In November 2011, the President signed into law the Returning Heroes Tax Credit and the Wounded Warriors Tax Credit, providing businesses with incentives to hire unemployed veterans and veterans with service-connected disabilities. The First Lady and Dr. Biden's Joining Forces Initiative has helped 90,000 veterans and military spouses find jobs. The federal government has also established the Veterans Employment Initiative, resulting in the hiring of 200,000 new veterans and at least 25,000 new Reservists in the federal workforce. The President has issued a Memorandum calling on all agencies to improve their compliance with employment and reemployment protections for veterans and servicemembers, including identifying best practices and improving data collection. The article also highlights the creation of two new veterans' tax credits, the challenge to the private sector to hire or train 100,000 veterans and their spouses, increased access to reemployment services, the development of online tools to boost veteran employment, and efforts to increase hiring of veterans in healthcare-related fields. Additionally, the Department of Defense has established a Military Credentialing and Licensing Task Force to streamline civilian credentialing for service members and veterans.
