The White House spokesperson, Bill Burton, stated that the President will wait for the bipartisan fiscal commission to complete its work before commenting on the initial Bowles-Simpson proposal. The President respects the difficult task that the Co-Chairs and Commissioners are undertaking and wants to give them the necessary space to work on it. These ideas are seen as a step in the process towards developing recommendations, and the President is looking forward to reviewing the final product in the coming month.
