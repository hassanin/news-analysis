First Lady Michelle Obama will be joining Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and local elected officials from across the country in Philadelphia to announce commitments to promote healthier lifestyles for children as part of the Let's Move! initiative. The City of Philadelphia has made significant progress in improving residents' overall health and physical fitness through its Get Healthy Philly initiative, which focuses on healthy eating, active living, and tobacco control. Philadelphia has increased access to healthy foods, opened new farmers' markets, trained corner stores to sell healthier products, and implemented bike lanes. The city has also incorporated healthy living into its comprehensive plan and established wellness councils in public schools. Other mayors from cities such as Newark, Oklahoma City, Nashville, and Sacramento will also be present at the event and will share their own initiatives to promote healthier lifestyles.
