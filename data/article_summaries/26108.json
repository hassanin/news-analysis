In a recent press conference, President Trump addressed the launch of a missile by North Korea, stating that his administration will handle the situation. He also mentioned that Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi did not attend a meeting with him, citing differences on crime, immigration, military spending, and taxes as reasons for their absence. Trump expressed confidence in the Republican senators' support for the tax bill, which he believes will be passed and result in the largest tax cut in US history. He also highlighted the high consumer confidence level and the need to strengthen the military. The press conference ended with General Mattis providing information about the missile launch and Trump reiterating that his approach to North Korea remains unchanged.
