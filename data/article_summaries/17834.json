The article discusses President Obama's trip to Marquette, Michigan, where he met with local business leaders and technology executives to discuss the importance of broadband access for business growth and exporting goods to new markets. The President briefly met with business owners who have utilized broadband access to expand their businesses, including Getz's Clothiers and V.I.O. Inc. He also met with senior technology executives from AT&T, Intel, and Qualcomm. 

The President then participated in a demonstration of how Northern Michigan University's WiMAX network enables distance learning for students. This includes professors contacting student teachers in the field and connecting to K-12 classes where master teachers are teaching. 

After the demonstration, the President delivered remarks at Northern Michigan University on his plan to catalyze the build-out of high-speed wireless services to enable businesses to grow faster, students to learn more, and public safety officials to access state-of-the-art, secure, nationwide, and interoperable mobile communications. He called for a National Wireless Initiative to make high-speed wireless services available to at least 98 percent of Americans. The initiative will free up spectrum through incentive auctions, spur innovation, create a nationwide wireless network for public safety, and reduce the national deficit by approximately $10 billion.
