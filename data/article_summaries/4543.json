The President is committed to improving the quality and safety of nursing home care in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the substandard conditions in nursing homes, where over 200,000 residents and staff have died from the virus. Despite receiving billions of dollars in federal funding, many nursing homes continue to provide poor care. Private equity firms have also been buying struggling nursing homes, leading to even worse outcomes for residents. The Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to address these issues by launching initiatives to ensure quality care, enhancing accountability and oversight, increasing transparency in facility ownership, and promoting good-paying jobs and union membership in nursing homes. The goal is to ensure that taxpayer dollars support safe and dignified care for seniors and people with disabilities, rather than going to predatory owners and operators.
