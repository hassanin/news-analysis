During a teleconference briefing, Jeff Zients, Dr. Walensky, and Dr. Fauci discussed the progress being made on COVID-19 vaccinations. They reported that the U.S. administered 1.1 million vaccine shots in a single day, the highest since July 3rd. In August, nearly 12.5 million first shots were given, which is 2 million more than in all of July. They also highlighted that 50% of 12- to 17-year-olds have received at least their first shot, an important milestone as schools reopen. The vaccination rate among adolescents is growing faster than any other age group. The speakers emphasized the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and the importance of getting more adolescents vaccinated. They also discussed the increasing momentum for vaccination requirements, with more employers, colleges, and universities adopting mandates. The speakers emphasized the power of vaccination requirements to protect communities and end the pandemic. Dr. Walensky discussed the importance of implementing layered prevention strategies in schools, including vaccination, masking, ventilation, distancing, and testing. She highlighted studies showing the effectiveness of these strategies in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in schools. Dr. Fauci discussed the high efficacy of mRNA vaccines in adolescents and the safety profile of the vaccines. He emphasized the benefits of vaccination for adolescents, including protecting themselves, their families, and their communities. The speakers addressed questions about hospitalization rates among children with COVID-19 and the need for updated school guidance. They stated that hospitalization rates among children are similar to prior surges, but the absolute number of cases is high due to the overall increase in cases. They also mentioned that there are no current plans to update the school guidance.
