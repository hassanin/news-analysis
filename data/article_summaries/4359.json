The White House has released a guidebook called "Building a Clean Energy Economy: A Guidebook to the Inflation Reduction Act's Investments in Clean Energy and Climate Action." The guidebook provides clear descriptions of the tax incentives and funding programs in the Inflation Reduction Act that aim to build a clean energy economy, lower energy costs, tackle climate change, and reduce pollution. It is meant to help various stakeholders, including state and local leaders, the private sector, non-profit organizations, homeowners, and communities, understand how they can benefit from these investments and unlock the full potential of the law. The guidebook walks through the law program-by-program and provides background information on each program's purpose, eligibility requirements, period of availability, and other important details. The guidebook is part of the administration's efforts to implement the Inflation Reduction Act and keep stakeholders informed about the latest developments. The act builds on President Biden's climate and clean energy investments and aims to create a new clean energy economy that will create jobs and reduce pollution. The guidebook has received positive feedback from leaders, who see it as a critical resource to help implement the law and take action on climate change.
