During a press conference at Westchester County Airport, President Biden provided an update on the debt limit talks. He stated that he has not received any update on the negotiations. When asked if he feels more optimistic about a deal today than yesterday, he emphasized that the purpose of the meeting was to lay out the budget proposals and begin a discussion. He also clarified that a short-term increase in the debt limit is not the only option and that there is still time to reach a comprehensive deal.

The President was also asked about his expectations for the upcoming meeting with the Republican Leader. He stated that the purpose of the meeting is to find out what the staffs have agreed upon and further discuss the budget proposals. He emphasized the need for clarity on what the Republicans are willing to cut from the budget, particularly in areas such as defense funding and support for veterans.

Regarding the situation at the border, President Biden acknowledged that there has been chaos at the border for years and emphasized the need to fully fund border security efforts. He mentioned his discussions with the President of Mexico, who has been cooperative and supportive of efforts to establish legal immigration pathways. The President confirmed that additional troops will be sent to the border to support the Border Patrol and free up their resources.

When asked about Congressman Santos and Justice Thomas, President Biden refrained from making specific comments. He stated that these matters are for Congress to decide and that there are still ongoing processes, such as hearings, to be conducted.

The President also briefly addressed the possibility of delaying or modifying his trip to the G7 summit, depending on the progress of the negotiations. He mentioned that negotiations can sometimes happen at the last second or well ahead of time, and he will make a decision based on the state of play at that time.

The press conference concluded with President Biden stating that some of the administration's plans, such as opening up consulates in other countries, will take time to implement. He emphasized the need for patience and reiterated that negotiations can be unpredictable.
