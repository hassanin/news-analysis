President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on May 11, 2018, recognizing Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week. The proclamation acknowledges the service and sacrifices made by law enforcement personnel in protecting American citizens. It emphasizes the importance of equipping law enforcement agencies with the necessary resources to keep communities safe, including funding for hiring more police officers, training for active shooter situations, and improving school safety. The proclamation also highlights the National Blue Alert Network, an emergency alert system that protects law enforcement officers and communities by disseminating critical information about violent offenders. President Trump emphasizes the need to prioritize the safety and well-being of law enforcement officers and mentions the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017, which provides resources to help officers deal with job stress and trauma. The proclamation concludes by calling on all Americans to observe Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week through appropriate ceremonies and activities, and to fly the flag at half-staff to honor fallen officers.
