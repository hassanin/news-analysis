On January 31, 2011, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13564, establishing the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness (PCJC) within the Department of the Treasury. The PCJC consists of members appointed by the President from outside the Federal Government, including representatives from various sectors of the economy. The council's functions are advisory in nature and include soliciting ideas from across the country to inform the President's decision-making, providing recommendations to executive departments and agencies related to the economy, growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation, reporting directly to the President on policies to promote economic growth and improve the prosperity of the American people, and providing analysis and information on the functioning of the economy. The PCJC is to be administered with the cooperation and support of all agencies and offices within the Executive Office of the President, with funding and administrative support provided by the Department of the Treasury. The council is set to terminate two years after the date of the order unless extended by the President. This order revokes Executive Order 13501, which established the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. The order is subject to applicable law and appropriations and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
