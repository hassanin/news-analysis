This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Somalia. The national emergency was declared in 2010 due to the deteriorating security situation and persistence of violence in Somalia, acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and violations of the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council. Additional steps were taken in 2012 to address exports of charcoal, misappropriation of Somali public assets, and acts of violence against civilians in Somalia. The national emergency, along with the measures adopted in 2010 and 2012, will continue to be in effect beyond April 12, 2014. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
