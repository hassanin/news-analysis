First Lady Michelle Obama praised the positive changes happening across the country to improve children's health, such as new school lunch programs and declining childhood obesity rates. She highlighted the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which has led to healthier school lunches with more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Mrs. Obama and Rachael Ray hosted a cooking competition to showcase these healthier meals. Mississippi, previously the most obese state, has seen a 13% decline in childhood obesity rates among elementary school students. Mrs. Obama commended Mississippi's efforts and urged other states and cities to follow suit. Comprehensive efforts, such as making healthy foods available in schools and communities and promoting physical activity, have contributed to the decline in childhood obesity rates. The Clinton Public School District in Mississippi is an example of a comprehensive effort, with community involvement and district-wide changes to promote physical wellness and academic achievement. The district offers healthier lunch options, holds recipe contests and cooking training, and partners with organizations to increase physical activity. The district has made health and wellness a top priority, on par with academic achievement.
