President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in Oklahoma due to the flooding that began on May 7, 2019. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local response efforts. The Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will coordinate disaster relief efforts to help the local population and provide assistance for emergency measures. FEMA is authorized to identify and provide necessary equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. The federal funding for emergency protective measures will be at 75 percent. Gerard M. Stolar has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
