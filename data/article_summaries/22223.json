Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, Lisa Monaco, recently met with British officials to discuss security and counterterrorism issues. The discussions focused on preventing and disrupting attacks by ISIL in the West. The United Kingdom is an important partner in counterterrorism efforts, and the meetings explored ways to enhance intelligence cooperation, information sharing, and counterterrorism capabilities in Europe. Monaco also co-led a session on "Counterterrorism in the Age of ISIL" at the Aspen Security Forum in London.
