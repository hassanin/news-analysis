On April 5, 1945, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt helped establish the Gold Star Wives organization to support the spouses and families of soldiers who died in service or due to service-related disabilities during World War II. The Gold Star Wives of America has since provided services, support, and love to these families. They bear a unique burden and the nation owes them a debt that can never be repaid, but the government will continue to honor them and fulfill its obligations to them.
