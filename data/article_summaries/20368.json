The Senate has passed a budget plan that aims to create jobs and reduce the deficit in a balanced way. The plan includes cutting wasteful spending, strengthening entitlements, and eliminating tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. The President and Democrats in Congress are willing to make tough choices to achieve deficit reduction and promote long-term job growth for the middle class. The House Republican budget, on the other hand, does not seek deficit reduction from closing tax loopholes for the wealthy, but instead makes significant cuts to education and manufacturing while increasing costs for seniors and the middle class. The White House insists on a balanced approach and calls for leaders to come together and find common ground. The President has proposed a compromise plan and will continue to work with both sides to find a solution to the budget challenges.
