The White House issued a Presidential Proclamation on October 5, 2009, recognizing Child Health Day. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of providing access to affordable, high-quality healthcare for all children in the United States. It states that healthy children are better equipped to combat illness and perform well in school. The responsibility for children's health is placed on every American, particularly parents and guardians who should lead by example in promoting healthy eating and an active lifestyle. The proclamation also highlights the need to support community programs that provide healthy choices for young people and ensure that families have the necessary resources to champion their children's health. It emphasizes the importance of physical fitness, access to healthy food, and empowering families with essential information for healthy living. The proclamation mentions the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as a step towards prioritizing children's health. The proclamation calls upon families, child health professionals, faith-based and community organizations, and governments to work together to ensure the safety and health of America's children.
