Vice President Mike Pence led a discussion with the chief executives of approximately 50 states, territories, and the city of Washington, DC, and the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The discussion focused on updating the governors on local, state, and federal COVID-19 response and recovery efforts, as well as America's reopening. The discussion highlighted best practices from governors on reopening their states, supporting small businesses and workforce development, expanding testing, supporting long-term care residents and healthcare workers, and increasing healthcare capacity. Updates were provided by Secretary of Health and Human Resources Alex Azar, Small Business Administration Administrator Jovita Carranza, Senior Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump, White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Dr. Debbie Birx, Rear Admiral John Polowczyk, and U.S. International Development Finance Corporation's CEO Adam Boehler. The participants also discussed the significant surge in testing capacity across the nation and shared best practices to support small businesses and workers. Since January 2020, the Trump Administration has led over 309 briefings, including 25 governors' briefings, with over 129,000 state, local, and tribal participants.
