During a press briefing, Press Secretary Jay Carney discussed various topics including student loan rates, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the situation in Syria, and the European debt crisis. Carney expressed concern about Speaker of the House John Boehner's reported comments on student loan rates, stating that it is unconscionable to allow rates to double for 7 million students. He also emphasized the importance of education for employment and economic growth. Carney commented on the ruling that DOMA is unconstitutional, stating that the President and the Attorney General believe that section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional and that the administration will no longer defend equal protection challenges against it in court. Carney also discussed the situation in Syria, expressing the need for a political transition and the urgency to prevent further violence and a sectarian civil war. He mentioned that the international community needs to unify and take action to pressure and isolate the Assad regime. Carney also mentioned the role of Iran in supporting the Syrian regime and the need to prevent further support from Iran. Finally, Carney briefly touched on the European debt crisis and the discussions between President Obama and the leaders of Germany, Italy, and France on the need for a focus on growth and job creation.
