Automakers, the United Autoworkers (UAW), and other leaders have released statements on the Biden Administration's steps to strengthen American leadership on clean cars and trucks. Ford, GM, and Stellantis announced their shared aspiration to achieve sales of 40-50% of annual U.S. volumes of electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030 to move closer to a zero-emissions future. They emphasized the need for electrification policies, such as purchase incentives, a comprehensive charging network, investments in R&D, and incentives to expand EV manufacturing and supply chains in the U.S. The UAW expressed the importance of investing in the U.S. to compete with China and Europe and emphasized the need to preserve wages and benefits for workers. BMW, Ford, Honda, Volkswagen, and Volvo supported the administration's goal of an EV future and called for nationwide greenhouse gas emissions standards, charging infrastructure investments, and consumer incentives. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation highlighted the industry's commitment to a net-zero carbon transportation future and the need for support from federal and state governments. California Governor Gavin Newsom praised the administration's move to reduce climate pollution and expressed the state's commitment to clean car leadership. The U.S. Climate Alliance also welcomed the proposed rules as a critical step forward in addressing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
