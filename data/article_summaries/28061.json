President Donald J. Trump has authorized an increase in federal funding for the Resighini Rancheria to provide additional disaster assistance for flooding that occurred between February 8-11, 2017. Under the major disaster declaration issued in May 2017, federal funding was made available for Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation at 75% of the total eligible costs. However, the President's order has now increased the federal share for Public Assistance to 90% of the total eligible costs. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
