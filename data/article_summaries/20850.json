First Lady Michelle Obama will surprise visitors on a White House tour on the one-year anniversary of President Obama's inauguration. Over 614,000 visitors have toured the White House in the past year, making it the largest attendance post 9/11. Mrs. Obama will continue the tradition of greeting visitors as they come in for public tours. The President and First Lady have also worked to enhance visitors' experiences by opening up the China Room to public tours, inviting guests to watch the President depart or arrive on Marine One, and providing guided tours of the Executive Residence. Various events such as the Easter Egg Roll, Spring and Fall Garden Tours, and visits to the White House Kitchen Garden have attracted thousands of visitors. The White House plans to continue providing more Americans the opportunity to visit in the coming year.
