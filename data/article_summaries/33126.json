President Donald Trump has extended the suspension and limitation on entry into the United States through the southern border with Mexico. The extension is a response to the ongoing crisis caused by the mass migration of aliens across the border. The recommendation to extend the suspension was made by the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security. The average number of inadmissible aliens entering the US each day remains high, and large groups of aliens continue to travel through Mexico with the intention of entering the US unlawfully. The ability to address these problems has been hindered by a nationwide injunction issued by a US District Judge in California. The injunction prevents the implementation of an interim final rule that would make aliens who enter the country in contravention of a proclamation limiting entry ineligible for asylum. President Trump has determined that the extension is necessary to protect the national interest and maintain an effectively functioning asylum system for legitimate asylum seekers. The suspension and limitation will expire 90 days after the date of the proclamation or the date on which an agreement permits the US to remove aliens to Mexico in compliance with the terms of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Secretaries of State, the Attorney General, and Homeland Security are required to submit a recommendation on whether to extend or renew the suspension within 75 days. The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security will continue to consult with the Mexican government to address large groups of aliens traveling through Mexico with the intent of entering the US unlawfully. The proclamation also includes provisions for severability and general provisions.
