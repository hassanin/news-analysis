The United States is expressing deep concern about the situation in Burkina Faso, where there are efforts to amend the constitution to allow the current leader to seek another term after being in office for 27 years. The US believes that democratic institutions are strengthened when established rules are consistently followed. They are calling on all parties, including the security forces, to stop the violence and return to a peaceful process to secure Burkina Faso's democratic gains.
