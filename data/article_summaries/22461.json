National Security Advisor Tom Donilon spoke with Bahraini Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa to express strong support for the Crown Prince's National Dialogue initiative. He also welcomed the steps taken by the Crown Prince and King Hamad to initiate an open dialogue on political reform with Bahraini society. Donilon urged Bahraini security forces to exercise continued restraint. The United States, as a longstanding partner of Bahrain, believes that the stability of the country depends on respecting the universal rights of the people, including the right to peaceful assembly, and implementing meaningful reform that aligns with the aspirations of all Bahrainis.
