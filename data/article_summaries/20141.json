This article is a transcript of a press gaggle by Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton en route to Newark, New Jersey. Burton briefly mentions a new video on the White House website that shows the President demonstrating how to use healthcare.gov. He then declines to comment on the ongoing BP investigation and emphasizes that the administration is committed to cleaning up the oil spill in the Gulf and restoring the region. Burton also mentions that the President will be attending two closed fundraisers that evening, but will not be making any formal remarks. He is asked about the President's meeting with Senator Kerry and whether they discussed Lockerbie or the WikiLeaks documents, to which Burton responds that he is not aware of the specific issues discussed. Burton also mentions that the President will sign the war supplemental as soon as possible. He is then asked about the President attending lavish fundraisers in light of the current economy, to which Burton responds by highlighting the progress made in the economy and referencing a study by economists Blinder and Zandi that found the policy response to be highly effective. Burton concludes the gaggle by joking about the President's upcoming appearance on "The View" and mentions that the administration is not expecting any changes in how ICE functions or how the Department of Homeland Security sees its role in light of the Arizona law going into effect.
