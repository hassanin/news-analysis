First Lady Michelle Obama will be joined by children from New Jersey communities affected by Hurricane Sandy, as well as children who helped plant the White House Kitchen Garden in April, to harvest the summer crop. The children from Union Beach Memorial School and Long Beach Island Grade School were displaced by Hurricane Sandy and are currently attending school in different locations. Despite the displacement, both schools have focused on keeping their students healthy, with Union Beach providing free lunches through the National School Lunch Program and Long Beach Island using MyPlate to teach kids about healthy eating. The other schools joining the harvest include Arthur D. Healey School in Somerville, MA, which promotes healthy eating and snacking at school and at home, Sarah Moore Greene Magnet Technology Academy in Knox County, TN, which has revamped lunch menus and integrated gardening into the curriculum, and Milton Elementary School in Milton, VT, which uses MyPlate, fruit and veggie bars, and local ingredients to provide nutritious meals.
