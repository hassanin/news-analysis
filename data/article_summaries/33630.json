The United States has become a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA estimates that the United States will continue to be a net exporter for all of 2020. This achievement follows the United States becoming the world's top producer of crude oil in 2018 and a net exporter of natural gas in 2017. The shale revolution, driven by U.S. energy innovation, has played a significant role in this production boom. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) states that the shale revolution has led to substantial consumer welfare gains, including significant decreases in the domestic price of natural gas and electricity, as well as a reduction in the global price of oil. The CEA estimates that the shale revolution saves U.S. consumers $203 billion annually, benefiting households across income quintiles, with low-income households experiencing the most significant percentage of savings. Furthermore, the shale revolution has also had positive environmental effects, with the CEA estimating that it has lowered U.S. energy-related greenhouse gas emissions by 527 million metric tons per year. These emissions reductions exceed previous government projections and have been achieved without imposing new costs on businesses or households. The article concludes that private-sector innovation, such as the shale revolution, can be more effective than heavy-handed government policies in achieving positive economic and environmental outcomes. The Trump Administration aims to continue promoting private-sector energy innovations to maximize the benefits of America's energy resources.
