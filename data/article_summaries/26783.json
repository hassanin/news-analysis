On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation to honor those who perished in defense of the United States during World War II. He recalled the events of December 7, 1941, when Japanese forces launched a surprise attack on American military installations in Hawaii, resulting in the deaths of over 2,400 Americans and propelling the nation into war. The president emphasized the resilience and courage of the American people during the war and highlighted the importance of maintaining a strong and vigilant military to preserve freedom. He also paid tribute to the USS Arizona Memorial, a resting place for many of the sailors and Marines who died during the attack. President Trump urged Americans to observe the day of remembrance and honor military personnel, past and present, through appropriate ceremonies and activities. He called on federal agencies and interested organizations to fly the U.S. flag at half-staff to honor those who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor.
