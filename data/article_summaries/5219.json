In a phone call, President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed the situation in Gaza. Biden expressed concern for the hostages still held by Hamas and emphasized the need for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to access them. The breakdown in the humanitarian pause was attributed to Hamas' refusal to release young women civilian hostages. Both leaders agreed to stay engaged in efforts to free the remaining hostages. Biden stressed the importance of continuous humanitarian aid to Gaza, welcoming Israel's decision to ensure sufficient fuel levels but emphasizing the need for more assistance. The President highlighted the need to protect civilians and establish safe corridors to separate them from Hamas. He also expressed concern about extremist violence against Palestinians and the need for stability in the West Bank. The leaders agreed to stay in regular consultation.
