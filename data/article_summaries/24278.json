This executive order, issued by President Barack Obama in 2011, aims to coordinate policies and programs to support automotive communities and workers in the United States. The order acknowledges the decline in employment in the automotive industry and the need for strategies to revitalize these communities. The Secretary of Labor is assigned responsibilities such as coordinating policies and programs among government agencies, advising the President on pending legislation, and conducting outreach to gather concerns and ideas from various stakeholders. The order also revokes a previous executive order and includes general provisions for implementation.
