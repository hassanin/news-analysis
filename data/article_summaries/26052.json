President Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett for the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Judge Barrett is highly qualified, having graduated from Rhodes College and Notre Dame Law School, and previously clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia. She was confirmed as a Federal judge in 2017. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Ted Cruz have expressed their support for her nomination. Judge Barrett's role as a dedicated wife and mother of seven, including two adopted children from Haiti and a son with Down syndrome, brings a unique perspective to the Court. She believes in putting the Constitution above personal views on the law and emphasized the importance of judges not being policymakers. If confirmed, she vows to serve the American people and administer justice impartially under the United States Constitution.
