The White House Press Secretary released a statement in 2014 expressing the President's strong support for net neutrality and an open internet. The statement emphasized that the internet's equality in terms of data, content, and access has driven economic growth and enabled small sites like eBay and Amazon to compete with larger businesses. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was mentioned as an independent agency, and the statement indicated that the White House would carefully review their proposal to preserve an open internet. The Court of Appeals' ruling in January presented a challenge to the FCC's efforts, but Chairman Wheeler expressed a goal of maintaining an open internet, and the White House expressed satisfaction with his willingness to consider all options. The President is committed to protecting a free and open internet and is open to any option that makes sense.
