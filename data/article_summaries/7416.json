The Biden-Harris administration will be announcing new actions to promote women's employment and support working families on Equal Pay Day. The administration will address pay equity for the federal workforce by proposing regulations that address the use of prior salary history in hiring and pay-setting processes. They will also promote pay equity for employees of federal contractors by considering limiting the use of salary information in employment decisions. The administration's actions will also increase access to good-paying jobs in sectors where women have historically been underrepresented, such as transportation, clean energy, and broadband. The Vice President will lead the Equal Pay Day Summit, which will highlight the importance of pay equity and feature conversations with advocates, business leaders, and members of the United States women's national soccer team. The administration's efforts aim to address pay discrimination, occupational segregation, and the need for affordable childcare.
