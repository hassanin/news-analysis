This executive order, issued on January 14, 2021, by President Donald Trump, focuses on promoting the "Buy American" policy and maximizing the use of goods, products, and materials produced in the United States. The order defines "Buy American" as policies that require or provide a preference for the purchase or acquisition of American-made goods, products, or materials. It also defines "Buy American Laws" as statutes, regulations, rules, and executive orders that relate to federal procurement or grants and require or provide a preference for the purchase or acquisition of American-made goods, products, or materials.

The purpose of this order is to address the United States Postal Service's (USPS) Buy American domestic procurement preferences and align them with the Buy American Laws implemented across other executive departments and agencies. The USPS currently applies its own Buy American policies in certain competitive procurements. The order encourages the USPS to consider amending its procurement policies to conform with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions regarding price differentials and when materials shall be considered of foreign origin.

The order concludes by stating that it does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, the USPS, or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also clarifies that the order should be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
