President Obama will be traveling to Ethiopia in late July for bilateral meetings with the Government of Ethiopia and the leadership of the African Union. This visit will build on the success of the 2014 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit and strengthen ties with African partners. It will also highlight America's commitment to investing in Africa and will be the first visit of a sitting U.S. President to Ethiopia and the African Union headquarters. The visit aims to accelerate economic growth, strengthen democratic institutions, and improve security in sub-Saharan Africa.
