Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced that the Bank of Dandong has been found to be a primary money laundering concern and sanctioned under the USA Patriot Act. The bank has facilitated millions of dollars in transactions for companies involved in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. Mnuchin stated that this action reaffirms the commitment of the Treasury Department to cut off North Korea from the US financial system. In addition, the Office of Foreign Asset Control has sanctioned two individuals and one entity for their support of North Korea's activities. Mnuchin emphasized that these actions are not targeting China and that the US is working with China to stop illicit financing involving North Korea. The US will also be meeting with China and other countries at the G20 summit to further efforts to cut off North Korea's activities.
