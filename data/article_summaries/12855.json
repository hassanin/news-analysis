The White House has launched a comprehensive open government plan, requiring federal agencies to take specific steps to increase transparency, collaboration, and participation. The Open Government Directive, released by the Office of Management and Budget, sets new standards for government agencies to be more accountable and accessible to the public. The directive was influenced by the Open Government Initiative, where citizens provided ideas on how to make the government more transparent and accountable. The plan includes sharing information online, publishing annual Freedom of Information Act reports, and creating agency-specific open government plans in consultation with the public. The White House will establish a forum and online dashboard to track progress and share best practices. The plan also includes reviewing and updating information policies to allow agencies to utilize new technologies for open government.
