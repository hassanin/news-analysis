This article is a presidential proclamation from September 14, 2009, commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The VAWA, authored by then United States Senator Joe Biden and signed into law in September 1994, was the first law to create a comprehensive response to violence against women at the national level. The VAWA aimed to improve the criminal justice system's response to violence against women and increase services available to victims. It required all 50 states to recognize and enforce protection orders issued by other jurisdictions and created new federal domestic violence crimes. The law also provided funding to communities and established a national domestic violence hotline. The article highlights the progress made in the 15 years since the VAWA became law, such as strengthening the response to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It mentions the growth of dedicated units of law enforcement officers and specialized prosecutors, as well as increased access to services for victims. However, it acknowledges that there is still work to be done, such as increasing access to sexual assault services, addressing the high rates of violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women, and ensuring culturally appropriate responses to violence. The proclamation calls upon men and women of all ages, communities, organizations, and all levels of government to collaborate in ending violence against women.
