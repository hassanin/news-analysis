The Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, discusses the benefits of the new trade pact among the United States, Mexico, and Canada, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Perdue believes that the USMCA will be a much stronger agreement than NAFTA and will provide important advantages for American workers and the agricultural sector. The agreement addresses 21st-century innovations in agricultural biotechnology and includes provisions to reduce trade-distorting policies, increase transparency, and ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of agricultural products. Perdue highlights the elimination of Canada's unfair milk pricing schemes and the increased access for United States dairy, poultry, egg, and wheat producers as significant victories for American agriculture. He praises President Trump's trade negotiation strategy and expresses optimism for future trade deals with countries like Japan and the European Union. Perdue emphasizes that free, fair, and expanded trade is beneficial for the American economy and the agricultural industry.
