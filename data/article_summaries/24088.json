The statement by the G-7 leaders addresses the situation in Ukraine and calls on Russia to cease its efforts to change the status of Crimea. They emphasize that any referendum held in Crimea would have no legal effect and would be considered deeply flawed due to the lack of preparation and presence of Russian troops. The leaders state that the annexation of Crimea by Russia would violate various international agreements and have serious implications for the unity and sovereignty of all states. They call on Russia to de-escalate the conflict, withdraw its forces, engage in direct discussions with the Ukrainian government, and seek international mediation. The G-7 leaders also express their decision to suspend participation in any activities related to the G-8 Sochi meeting until Russia changes its course. They urge Russia to work together diplomatically to resolve the crisis and support a sovereign, independent, inclusive, and united Ukraine.
