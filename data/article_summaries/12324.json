President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 2014 as National Foster Care Month in the United States. The proclamation recognizes the almost 400,000 young people in foster care and the foster parents and professionals who support them. It highlights the challenges faced by those in foster care, including finding mentors and support during their transition into adulthood. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of providing stability and a safe home for every child. The Affordable Care Act is mentioned as a means to extend Medicaid coverage up to age 26 for children who have aged out of foster care. The administration is committed to breaking down barriers for qualified caregivers to become adoptive or foster parents. Grants have also been awarded to provide strategies for finding permanent families for foster children and supporting their behavioral and mental health needs. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe National Foster Care Month by helping youth in foster care and recognizing the commitment of those who support them.
