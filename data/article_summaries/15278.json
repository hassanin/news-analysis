Vice President Biden visited Cincinnati, Ohio to highlight the progress made by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in the area. He visited the American Can Building, a former abandoned factory being converted into a multi-use economic development project. The ARRA has allocated $4.4 billion to Ohio, including funds for education, healthcare, and transportation. In Cincinnati, the Vice President announced the approval of a $3.5 million federal grant to stabilize and revive local neighborhoods, rehabilitate affordable housing, and improve public facilities. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, funded through the ARRA, will support state and local community development and stimulate employment. The Recovery Act is impacting various aspects of Ohioans' lives, such as housing, transportation, education, and job creation. The ARRA has committed $174 billion in its first 130 days, including $43 billion in tax cuts, with one third of the funding dedicated to tax cuts for 95% of Americans. The act is expected to save or create 750,000 jobs in its first 200 days.
