Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at the White House Rose Garden to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. She began by addressing the conflict between Israel and Hamas, expressing support for Israel's right to defend itself and the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination. Harris also announced that the Biden-Harris administration is providing $100 million in assistance to the Palestinian people and working to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Moving on to the topic at hand, Harris praised the Hispanic community and the contributions of Hispanic leaders throughout history. She emphasized the vibrancy and optimism of young Hispanic leaders and shared her experiences visiting Hispanic-Serving Institutions during her national college tour.

Harris discussed the challenges facing the Hispanic community, including disparities in venture capital investment and access to loans for Latino entrepreneurs. She highlighted the administration's efforts to address these disparities, such as investing in community banks and providing support to Hispanic-Serving Institutions.

The Vice President also mentioned the administration's achievements, including record Latino small-business growth, capping the cost of insulin for seniors, and investing in education. She encouraged young leaders to be proud of their identities and to carry the voices of their families and communities into the rooms where decisions are made.

The speech ended with a performance by Gaby Moreno.
