Governor-elect Andrew Cuomo of New York supports the federal tax cut compromise, praising President Obama's leadership in stabilizing the economy. He believes that failing to act now would lead to higher taxes for most Americans, which would be detrimental to the fragile economy and could result in more job losses. Cuomo also highlights that the compromise includes an extension of unemployment benefits for those most affected by the recession, as well as a significant tax break for middle-class families in New York and the rest of the country. While not everyone may agree with every provision in the deal, Cuomo acknowledges that compromise and bipartisanship are essential.
