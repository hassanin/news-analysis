This executive order, issued on March 26, 2019, focuses on preparing for the effects of electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) on critical infrastructure and technology systems. An EMP is a burst of electromagnetic energy that can disrupt and damage technology systems both on Earth and in space. The order highlights the potential impact of EMPs on national security, economic prosperity, and global commerce. It emphasizes the need for the federal government to foster sustainable and cost-effective approaches to improve the nation's resilience to EMPs. The order defines critical infrastructure as systems and assets vital to the United States, and it outlines the roles and responsibilities of various government agencies in addressing the threat of EMPs. The order also calls for collaboration, information sharing, and the development of best practices and regulations to strengthen critical infrastructure against EMPs. It directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure systems most vulnerable to EMPs and develop a plan to mitigate their effects. The order also addresses research and development, threat assessments, response planning, and the enhancement of private-sector engagement in addressing EMPs.
