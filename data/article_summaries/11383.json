President Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had a phone call to discuss economic issues, particularly Canada's role as host of the upcoming G8 and G20 summits. They agreed to collaborate within the G8 to support development and address peace and security concerns. They also recognized the importance of the G20 in achieving a sustainable economic recovery, restoring fiscal stability, fostering a balanced global economy, and implementing reforms in the financial sector. President Obama will be attending both summits in Canada later in the week.
