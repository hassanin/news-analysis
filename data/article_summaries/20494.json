Vice President Biden announced a series of federal actions to support the development of a strong home energy efficiency retrofit industry. These actions include the introduction of a Home Energy Score program that will help homeowners make informed decisions about energy improvements, as well as a retrofit financing program called PowerSaver. The announcement is the result of an 18-month interagency effort to address barriers to a nationwide market for home energy upgrades. Other initiatives announced include new workforce guidelines for home energy upgrades, protocols for maintaining healthy indoor environments during retrofits, and a Small Business Administration course on green business opportunities. The goal of these actions is to grow the home retrofit industry, save families money, and increase energy efficiency.
