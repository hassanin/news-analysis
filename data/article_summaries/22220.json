President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring September 20, 2013, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. The proclamation pays tribute to service members who have not returned from the battlefield and honors those who are held captive as prisoners of war. It emphasizes the country's determination to recover missing patriots and provide a full accounting to their loved ones. The proclamation also calls for the care and support of veterans, military families, and those who have placed themselves in harm's way. On this day, a black and white banner symbolizing America's Missing in Action and Prisoners of War will be flown over various locations across the country. Americans are encouraged to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
