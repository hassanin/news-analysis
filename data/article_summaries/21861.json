This article is a transcript of a press briefing by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan. They discuss the initiatives put forward by President Obama to help responsible homeowners. The initiatives include opening up refinancing for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac borrowers, creating a Homeowner Bill of Rights to ensure fair treatment for homeowners, and establishing a plan to allow families to refinance their loans even if they are not insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the FHA. They also address questions about the impact of the initiatives on banks, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and the overall housing market.
