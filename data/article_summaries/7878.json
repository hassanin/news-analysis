The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is investing $2.7 billion from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to strengthen ports and waterways, improve supply chains, and enhance climate resilience. This funding will support over 300 Army Corps projects across the country. Additionally, the Department of the Interior is allocating $1.7 billion in rural infrastructure funding for FY 2023, focusing on addressing drought and improving water infrastructure. These investments aim to benefit historically marginalized communities and promote economic growth while combating climate change. The projects will also reduce congestion on inland waterways and enhance coastal and inland flood risk reduction. Overall, these initiatives support the Biden Administration's commitment to infrastructure development, climate resilience, and job creation.
