President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. This funding is in response to the damage caused by Typhoon Mangkhut in September 2018. The major disaster declaration issued in September 2018 provided federal funding for Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance at 75% of the eligible costs. However, President Biden's order increases the federal share to 90% of the total eligible costs. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
