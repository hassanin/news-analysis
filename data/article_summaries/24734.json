The White House has announced that the United States will provide nearly $601 million in additional aid to those affected by the war in Syria. This brings the total humanitarian assistance to more than $5.1 billion since the start of the crisis. The funding will provide shelter, water, medical care, food, and other necessities to millions of people suffering inside Syria and to the 4.6 million refugees from Syria in the region. The United States will also provide more than $290 million in development assistance to support education in Jordan and Lebanon, including Syrian refugees in those countries. The announcement comes in the context of other leaders in the international community making pledges to assist Syrian refugees. The European Union has pledged $3.3 billion, Germany has pledged $2.6 billion, and the United Kingdom has pledged $1.75 billion in new aid by 2020. The United States continues to lead the international response to the millions of lives affected by the violence in Syria.
