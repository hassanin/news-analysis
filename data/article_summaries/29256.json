President Trump has issued a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of Senator John McCain's interment, as a way to honor his service to the country. Vice President Mike Pence will offer an address at the ceremony honoring McCain at the United States Capitol on Friday. The McCain family has requested military transportation of McCain's remains from Arizona to Washington, D.C., as well as military pallbearers and band support, and a horse and caisson transport during the service at the United States Naval Academy. Finally, President Trump has asked General John Kelly, Secretary James Mattis, and Ambassador John Bolton to represent his Administration at McCain's services.
