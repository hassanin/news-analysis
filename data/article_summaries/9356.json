In a recent interview, President Biden was asked if congressional Democrats should prioritize voting rights legislation over his Build Back Better plan. The President responded by stating that if they can pass voting rights legislation, they should do it. He emphasized that there is nothing domestically more important than voting rights, as it is the single-biggest issue. However, if they are unable to pass voting rights legislation, they should continue with the Build Back Better plan.
