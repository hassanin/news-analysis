The White House is deeply concerned about the release of Rafael Caro Quintero from prison in Mexico. Quintero had been serving a 40-year prison term for the 1985 kidnapping, torture, and murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena. There are reports that another individual connected to Camarena's killing could also be released. The United States remains committed to seeing Quintero and others involved in this crime face justice and will work closely with Mexican authorities on this matter.
