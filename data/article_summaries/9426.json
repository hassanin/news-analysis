President Obama has accepted the request of Caitlin Halligan to withdraw her nomination for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The President expressed disappointment that her nomination was blocked by a minority of Senators, preventing a simple up-or-down vote. He believes that Halligan, with her qualifications and reputation, would have served with distinction. The President also expressed concern about the number of vacancies on the D.C. Circuit, the nation's second-highest court, and remains committed to filling these vacancies to ensure equal and timely access to justice for all Americans.
