On March 23, 2009, President Obama had a 25-minute phone call with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom. They discussed three major topics: the G-20 Summit and the international financial crisis, Iran, and Afghanistan-Pakistan. Both leaders found the conversation productive, particularly in preparation for their bilateral meeting in London and the G-20 Summit. The White House and 10 Downing Street are planning another call before President Obama's departure for London.
