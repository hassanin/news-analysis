President Trump and members of the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board held their inaugural board meeting to discuss advancing a national workforce strategy. The board, consisting of industry, education, government, and non-profit leaders, aims to increase workforce participation rates and connect workers with good-paying jobs. The four goals discussed during the meeting were promoting multiple pathways to successful careers, improving data availability for students and workers, modernizing candidate recruitment and training practices, and encouraging employer-led training and investments. The board will also help shape the legislative agenda to mobilize the higher education system and make it more responsive to the needs of students and job creators.
