The open enrollment period on HealthCare.gov has begun, allowing Americans to sign up for quality, affordable health coverage until January 15th, 2022. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, coverage is more accessible and affordable than ever, with premiums decreasing to historic lows and four in five customers finding coverage for less than $10 a month. The Department of Health and Human Services is increasing staff to help families navigate their coverage options and reaching people in more languages. The Build Back Better Framework aims to expand affordable healthcare even further, reducing premiums for over nine million Americans, providing coverage to four million uninsured people in Medicaid non-expansion states, and expanding Medicare for affordable hearing care. The President urges everyone to visit HealthCare.gov to renew or shop for a plan and urges Congress to pass the Build Back Better framework.
