The article discusses the maternal health crisis in the United States, particularly among Black women, who are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications compared to white women. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to addressing these disparities and creating a healthcare system that is equitable and safe for Black families. To achieve this, various measures are being taken, including extended postpartum coverage for pregnant individuals enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, addressing maternal challenges faced by women veterans, proposing a hospital quality designation focused on maternity care, and providing comprehensive substance use treatment and recovery support services for pregnant and postpartum women. The administration also aims to expand access to maternal care, lower healthcare costs, diversify the maternal health workforce, improve maternal mental health treatment, and enhance research. The proclamation of Black Maternal Health Week aims to raise awareness, address systemic discrimination, and commit to creating a world where Black women feel safe, respected, and dignified during and after pregnancy.
