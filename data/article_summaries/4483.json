President Biden held a press conference in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. He began by announcing positive news about the economy, stating that inflation has been decreasing for the past six months. He highlighted that inflation is now at its lowest level since October 2021. The decrease in inflation is attributed to falling gas prices, which has saved families money. Food inflation is also slowing, with the smallest increase in food prices in almost two years. Additionally, core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has reached its lowest level in a year.

President Biden emphasized that as inflation decreases, take-home pay for workers is increasing, particularly for lower and middle-income workers. He stated that his economic plan is working and has led to the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, with nearly 11 million jobs created during his first two years in office. He also highlighted historic investments in American manufacturing, resulting in new factories and jobs.

However, President Biden expressed disappointment with the first bills passed by House Republicans, which he believes favor wealthy individuals and corporations at the expense of middle-class taxpayers. He vowed to veto any bills that cut Social Security or Medicare. He expressed willingness to work with Republicans on solutions to lower inflation, create more jobs, and build an economy that benefits everyone.

The press conference concluded with President Biden addressing questions about classified material found in his personal library and the health of the First Lady, who recently underwent surgery.
