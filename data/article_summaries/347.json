The United States has emphasized the need for global ambition and cooperation to address the climate crisis during the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26). President Joe Biden highlighted the importance of involving all sectors of society, including communities, businesses, governments, and nations, to achieve economic prosperity, peace, and security. The U.S. has taken significant steps to reduce emissions and promote economic opportunities domestically and internationally. These efforts include rejoining the Paris Agreement, hosting the Leaders Summit on Climate, and passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, which focuses on clean energy infrastructure and emissions reduction. The U.S. aims to achieve a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 and reduce emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels by 2030. While COP26 concluded with a global commitment to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the U.S. recognizes that more work is needed to align with scientific recommendations. The U.S. will continue to advocate for progress in climate action both domestically and internationally in the coming decade.
