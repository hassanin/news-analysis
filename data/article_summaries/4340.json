President Biden held a teleconference with six governors to discuss the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations in their states. The governors of Maine, Ohio, Utah, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and New Mexico shared their strategies for improving access to vaccines, building confidence in vaccines, and ensuring equity in vaccine distribution. They discussed innovative programs such as mobile vaccine units, pop-up clinics, and partnerships with community organizations, churches, and businesses. The governors also highlighted the importance of data collection, outreach to underserved communities, and the use of incentives to encourage vaccination. President Biden praised the governors for their leadership and expressed confidence that the goal of vaccinating 70% of adult Americans with at least one shot by July 4th can be achieved. He also discussed the administration's plans to make vaccination more convenient, such as walk-in clinics and partnerships with ride-sharing companies to provide free transportation to vaccination sites.
