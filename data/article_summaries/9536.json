The Obama Administration has released the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC) in an effort to protect consumers from fraud and identity theft, enhance privacy, and foster economic growth. The strategy aims to create an "Identity Ecosystem" where consumers can obtain a single credential, such as a smart card or token, to log into any website securely. This eliminates the need for multiple passwords and allows consumers to prove their identity for sensitive transactions while remaining anonymous for other activities. The NSTIC also promotes privacy-enhancing policies and technologies to ensure strong privacy protections for consumers. The strategy is a private-sector led effort, facilitated by the government, to develop the necessary technologies, standards, and policies for the Identity Ecosystem. The goal is to provide more security and privacy for consumers while enabling businesses to move more services online. The NSTIC offers various examples of how the Identity Ecosystem can benefit individuals, businesses, and the government, including faster online errands, age-appropriate access, smart phone transactions, efficient and secure business operations, and enhanced public safety. The strategy is based on principles of privacy enhancement, voluntary participation, security, resilience, interoperability, and cost-effectiveness. It aims to provide convenience, privacy, and security for individuals, while also promoting innovation, efficiency, and trust in the private sector and government.
