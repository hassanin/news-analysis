In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki provided updates on several topics. Firstly, President Biden is signing three executive orders to rebuild and strengthen the immigration system. These actions include creating a task force to reunify families, addressing the root causes of migration, and promoting immigrant integration and inclusion. Secondly, the federal government will deliver additional COVID-19 vaccines to select pharmacies across the country starting on February 11th. The goal is to provide more sites for people to get vaccinated in their communities. Thirdly, the administration is working to ensure that states have the resources they need to turn vaccines into vaccinations. This includes fully reimbursing states for eligible services provided since the beginning of the pandemic and increasing weekly vaccine allocation to states by an additional 5% for the next three weeks. The administration is also committed to passing the American Rescue Plan, which includes provisions for COVID-19 relief and economic recovery. Psaki emphasized that the President is open to bipartisan ideas, but the overall package will not be significantly reduced. Psaki also addressed other topics such as the sentencing of Alexei Navalny in Russia, the travel ban, and the possibility of a visit to Canada by President Biden.
