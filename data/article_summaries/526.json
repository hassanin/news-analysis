The U.S. Department of State, USAID, and the Partnership for Central America have announced programs to support women's economic empowerment in northern Central America and the broader Western Hemisphere. Vice President Kamala Harris has secured commitments from private sector companies and organizations, including Accion, CARE International, Cargill, Mastercard, Microsoft, and PepsiCo, to remove barriers to women's economic participation and improve their access to employment, resources, and networks for business development. These commitments also aim to address gender-based violence in northern Central America. The initiatives align with the U.S. Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration in northern Central America, launched by Vice President Harris in July 2021. Additionally, the Vice President and the Partnership for Central America have launched the In Her Hands initiative, which aims to empower, train, and protect women in the region. Founding members include CARE, Cargill, Mastercard, Microsoft, Millicom, Nespresso, PepsiCo, PriceSmart, and Pro Mujer. The In Her Hands commitments will connect over 1.4 million women to the financial system and digital economy, promote women's participation in the agroindustry, train over 500,000 women and girls in job skills, and promote gender parity within companies. The U.S. government has also announced initiatives to complement the private sector commitments and empower women and girls in Latin America.
