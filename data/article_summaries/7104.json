President Biden will host the third annual White House Tribal Nations Summit, emphasizing the importance of strengthening the Nation-to-Nation relationships between the United States and Tribal Nations. The summit will bring together Tribal leaders and top administration officials to discuss key issues facing Tribal communities. The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized advancing Tribal sovereignty and self-determination, and has made significant investments to support Tribal Nations and Native communities through the Investing in America agenda. During the summit, several new actions will be announced, including a historic executive order, to promote Nation-to-Nation partnerships, respect Tribal sovereignty and Native history, protect the health and welfare of Native women, children, and families, and improve access to federal funding for Tribal Nations. The Administration will also release a comprehensive 2023 Progress Report for Tribal Nations, highlighting the progress made in supporting Indian Country and addressing the concerns of Tribal communities. Some of the specific actions include addressing the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous people, securing advance funding for Indian Health Service, and establishing partnerships with Tribal Nations to co-steward ancestral lands and waters. These actions build upon the Administration's ongoing efforts to support Tribal Nations and Native communities.
