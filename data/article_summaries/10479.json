The White House Press Secretary released a statement applauding Mexico for being the first major emerging economy to submit its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) on climate change. The U.S. welcomes Mexico's submission, which includes a target to peak its emissions by 2026 and reduce them thereafter. The statement expresses hope that Mexico's actions will encourage other economies to submit ambitious, timely, transparent, detailed, and achievable INDCs.
