The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus has outlined their priorities, which include making devastating cuts to public safety and increasing costs for working- and middle-class families in order to protect and extend tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations. Their proposed tax cuts would be so expensive that the resulting cuts would not reduce the deficit. In contrast, the President's Budget aims to invest in America, lower costs for families, protect and strengthen Medicare and Social Security, and reduce the deficit by $3 trillion over 10 years, without increasing taxes for those making less than $400,000 per year. The extreme Freedom Caucus proposal would have several negative impacts, including endangering public safety, raising costs for families, shipping manufacturing jobs overseas, weakening national security, and hurting seniors. The Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that the budget math presented by Congressional Republicans does not add up, as meeting their goal of balancing the budget without raising taxes on the wealthy or corporations, and without cutting Social Security, Medicare, defense, and some veterans' benefits would require eliminating everything else in the Federal budget. The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus proposal would be detrimental to families, particularly by endangering public safety. While the President's Budget suggests smart investments to improve public safety, strengthen border security, and enhance transportation safety, extreme MAGA Republicans are pushing for drastic cuts to these critical national priorities, which would put Americans' safety at risk.
