The White House expresses regret and objection to the sentencing of Kian Tajbakhsh, an Iranian-American scholar, to 15 years in prison by the Islamic Republic of Iran. They state that Tajbakhsh poses no threat to Iran or its national security and has dedicated his life to fostering understanding between Iran and the international community. The White House is concerned that Tajbakhsh may not have had legal counsel during his trial and emphasizes the importance of due process and the right to a fair and public hearing. They urge Iran to release Tajbakhsh as soon as possible.
