Yesterday, in honor of Second Chance Month, White House officials Susan Rice, Cedric Richmond, and Dana Remus hosted a virtual discussion with formerly incarcerated individuals leading criminal justice reform efforts. The participants highlighted the disproportionate incarceration of Black and brown people and the challenges they face upon reentry, such as securing employment and housing. Rice, Richmond, and Remus thanked the participants for their leadership and asked for their policy recommendations to reduce incarceration, address racial disparities, and support successful reentry. The officials also discussed existing initiatives to improve public safety and reentry, such as removing loan eligibility barriers and promoting voting rights for formerly incarcerated individuals. The participants expressed a desire to continue collaborating on criminal justice reform.
