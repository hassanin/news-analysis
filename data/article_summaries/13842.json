The article discusses a recent counter-ISIL operation conducted by U.S. personnel in eastern Syria. The operation aimed to capture an ISIL senior leader, Abu Sayyaf, and his wife, Umm Sayyaf. Abu Sayyaf was killed during the operation, while Umm Sayyaf was captured and is currently in U.S. military detention in Iraq. The operation also resulted in the liberation of a young Yezidi woman who was held as a slave by the couple. No U.S. personnel were harmed during the operation. Abu Sayyaf was involved in overseeing ISIL's illicit oil and gas operations, which are a significant source of revenue for the terrorist organization. Umm Sayyaf is suspected to be a member of ISIL and may have been complicit in the enslavement of the young woman. The operation was authorized by the President based on the recommendation of his national security team and was conducted with the consent of Iraqi authorities and in accordance with domestic and international law. The U.S. will continue to support Iraq in its efforts to degrade and eliminate ISIL.
