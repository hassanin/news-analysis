On September 12, 2017, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) released Automated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety 2.0, an update to the 2016 Federal Automated Vehicles Policy. The new policy aims to ensure innovation in automated vehicle technologies, increase the safety of American roadways, and provide a consistent regulatory framework for automated driving systems (ADS). The development and deployment of ADS have the potential to reduce the number and severity of automobile crashes caused by human error, saving lives. The market for automated vehicles is projected to be worth over $40 billion in 2025 and over $75 billion in 2035. The policy also includes technical assistance to states and best practices for encouraging ADS development. The DOT and NHTSA will continue to refine and update ADS guidance as technology advances and stakeholder input is considered.
