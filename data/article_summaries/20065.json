President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring March 15-21, 2015, as National Poison Prevention Week in the United States. The proclamation raises awareness about the risks posed by household and environmental poisons to Americans of all ages. It states that while children under the age of 6 account for half of all cases of poison exposure, more than 90 percent of poisoning deaths occur among people over the age of 20. The proclamation emphasizes that poisonings are often avoidable and treatable, and encourages individuals to take action to prevent these tragedies. It highlights the importance of keeping poisonous items out of children's sight and reach, properly labeling and storing chemicals and medicines, understanding medication instructions, being aware of local environmental poisons, practicing safe food preparation, and installing carbon monoxide detectors. The proclamation also urges individuals to take fast action if they suspect someone has been poisoned by calling the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. It emphasizes the importance of education and awareness about poisons and highlights the resources available in local communities. The proclamation concludes by encouraging Americans to observe National Poison Prevention Week by taking actions to protect their families from hazardous household materials and the misuse of prescription medicines.
