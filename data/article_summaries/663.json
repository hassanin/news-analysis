The Biden administration has established the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse in response to the widespread issue of online harassment and abuse. The task force aims to develop concrete actions to prevent online harassment and abuse, support survivors, increase accountability, and expand research. Stakeholders, including survivors, advocates, and professionals, have shared their experiences and highlighted the severe impact of online harassment and abuse on health, education, and careers. The task force's initial blueprint focuses on prevention, survivor support, accountability, and research. It includes actions such as creating safer online environments, incorporating digital safety curricula in schools, increasing training for professionals, strengthening coordination among law enforcement agencies, and conducting research on the impacts of online harassment and abuse. The task force will continue to work across federal agencies to further develop their blueprint and will release a final report at the end of the year. The Biden administration recognizes online harassment and abuse as a multifaceted problem that requires a coordinated response from various sectors.
