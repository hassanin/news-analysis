President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I had a conversation where we condemned the unprovoked attack by Russian military forces. I updated him on the actions we are taking to gather international condemnation, including at the United Nations Security Council. President Zelenskyy requested that I urge world leaders to clearly denounce President Putin's aggressive actions and support Ukraine. Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the leaders of the G7 and imposing strong sanctions on Russia alongside the United States and our allies. We will also continue to provide assistance and support to Ukraine and its people.
