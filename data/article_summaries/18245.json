President Obama has signed an Executive Order aimed at streamlining the export/import process for American businesses. The Order requires the completion of the International Trade Data System (ITDS) by December 2016, which will allow businesses to electronically transmit the data required by the U.S. Government to import or export cargo. This new system will speed up the shipment of American-made goods overseas, eliminate duplicative paperwork, and make the government more efficient. The ITDS will also reduce the time and expense for businesses to move goods across borders. Additionally, the Order establishes a deadline for completion, requires agencies to transition to electronic data collection, and calls for enhanced transparency. The government will also partner with non-government stakeholders to improve business processes and border management policies. The Border Interagency Executive Council (BIEC) will be responsible for improving coordination among agencies and stakeholders. The ITDS Board of Directors will oversee the development of the ITDS automated capabilities.
