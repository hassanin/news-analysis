The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a fact sheet on U.S. engagement on climate change and resilience in Africa. The fact sheet highlights the need to build resilient communities in countries facing socio-economic challenges exacerbated by climate change. It discusses the Global Resilience Partnership, a $100 million initiative by USAID and the Rockefeller Foundation to protect vulnerable populations. The partnership will focus on three regions with historically high vulnerability to shocks - the Sahel, Horn of Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. The fact sheet also mentions efforts to improve resilience in Ethiopia, Kenya, and the Sahel region. Additionally, it discusses the Malabo Declaration, which aims to accelerate agricultural growth and reduce vulnerability to climate-related risks in Africa. The fact sheet highlights the United States' commitment to support the declaration through initiatives such as the Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture and the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) initiative. It also mentions the President's Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI), which supports African countries in building resilience to climate change and promoting low-emission development. The GCCI invests in climate change solutions, clean energy, and improved land management in Africa. The fact sheet concludes by emphasizing the importance of a global solution to climate change and the United States' commitment to developing an international climate change agreement in 2015.
