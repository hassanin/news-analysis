In this article, President Donald Trump proclaims November 2020 as Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month. He highlights the vulnerabilities that exist in the nation's critical infrastructure, particularly in relation to cyber threats. The manipulation of data networks and interruption of the electric power grid can have severe consequences for healthcare, finance, government services, and various industries. To address these issues, Trump mentions the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Act of 2018, which works to make critical infrastructure more resilient to cyber and physical threats. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CISA has provided guidance to protect the essential workforce and assist owners and operators in assessing risk and allocating resources. The administration has also taken steps to strengthen the security and resilience of critical infrastructure, including signing executive orders to prevent disruption or manipulation of positioning, navigation, and timing services, secure communications networks, and protect the bulk-power system. Additionally, actions have been taken to reduce dependence on foreign supply chains and promote domestic production of essential medicines. Trump emphasizes the importance of continuously adapting to evolving threats and hazards, and calls on Americans to recognize the significance of protecting the nation's infrastructure and observing the month with measures to enhance national security and resilience.
