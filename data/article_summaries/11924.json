The White House applauds the United Nations Security Council for unanimously adopting Resolution 2014, which addresses the crisis in Yemen. The resolution calls for President Saleh to sign and implement a political settlement based on the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative, demands all parties refrain from violence, and urges authorities to protect the rights of Yemen's citizens. The international community has sent a clear signal to President Saleh that he must transfer power immediately in response to the aspirations of the Yemeni people. The longer the political solution is delayed, the deeper Yemen falls into turmoil. The United States believes that only a Yemeni-led process can bring an end to the bloodshed and address the country's economic, humanitarian, and security challenges. The United States stands with the Yemeni people and will provide assistance with the implementation of a political transition.
