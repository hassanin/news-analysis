The article discusses the tax savings available for American families through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It states that one-third of the Recovery Act consisted of tax cuts, which have already provided over $160 billion in relief for families and businesses. The average tax refund is up nearly 10% this year, largely due to the Recovery Act tax credits. The article highlights various tax savings, such as the Making Work Pay tax credit, the American Opportunity Credit for college expenses, the First-Time Homebuyers Tax Credit, and tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements. It also mentions that taxpayers can use the WhiteHouse.gov Tax Savings Tool to determine which Recovery Act tax credits they are eligible for.
