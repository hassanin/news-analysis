The United States has praised the UN Human Rights Council for adopting a resolution that supports the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals. This is the second resolution of its kind passed by the Council and emphasizes that LGBT individuals are entitled to the same rights and freedoms as all people. The resolution also expresses concern about acts of violence and discrimination against the LGBT community and calls for the preparation of a report on preventing such abuses. The US applauds Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay for their leadership in sponsoring the resolution and commends the Council for reinforcing the principle that LGBT rights are human rights.
