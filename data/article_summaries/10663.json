President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Nevada, ordering federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms and flooding that occurred from September 7-9, 2014. The federal funding will be available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The Moapa Band of Paiutes Reservation will also receive federal funding for hazard mitigation measures. Mark H. Landry has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
