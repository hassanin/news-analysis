This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The President declared this national emergency in 2006 and ordered measures to block the property of certain individuals contributing to the conflict in the country. The emergency was declared due to the widespread violence and atrocities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which posed a threat to regional stability and the foreign policy of the United States. The national emergency will continue for another year, as the situation still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
