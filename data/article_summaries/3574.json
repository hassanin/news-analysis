President Biden's American Families Plan aims to invest in rural communities and strengthen the middle class. The plan includes provisions for universal pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds, free community college and other postsecondary investments, support for education and preparation for teachers in rural schools, expanded access to high-quality child care, paid family and medical leave for rural workers, improved nutrition programs, and tax cuts for families and workers. The plan seeks to reduce rural poverty rates and promote economic growth in rural areas.
