The National Park Service oversees 417 parks, recreation areas, and historic sites in the United States. National Park Week, which is a week and a half long, kicked off on April 15th with four admission-free days. Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, visited four National Parks to celebrate National Park Week. National Parks showcase America's wilderness, wildlife, and culture and are important for historic, cultural, and environmental preservation. They also contribute to the economy, generating $32 billion in economic output in 2015 and supporting jobs and local communities. The parks attract millions of visitors each year, with the ten most-visited parks receiving around 50 million visitors. In addition to natural parks, there are also urban parks and historic battlefields preserved by the National Park Service. President Trump recently donated his first quarter salary to the National Park Service. Secretary Zinke is a supporter of conservation and aims to continue the legacy of President Theodore Roosevelt in preserving and protecting public lands. It is important to invest in the parks to ensure their preservation for future generations. To find a National Park near you, visit www.nps.gov/findapark.
