President Donald Trump has issued a Presidential Memorandum stating that the national emergency with respect to Burundi, which was declared in November 2015, will continue to be in effect. The national emergency was initially declared due to the unusual and extraordinary threat posed by the situation in Burundi, including violence against civilians, unrest, incitement of imminent violence, political repression, and the potential threat to peace, security, and stability in Burundi and the region. The memorandum states that the situation in Burundi still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and therefore, the national emergency needs to be extended beyond November 22, 2017. The memorandum also states that this notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
