The Biden-Harris Administration is set to announce a new executive order establishing a sanctions regime to increase pressure on the parties involved in the conflict in Ethiopia. The aim is to encourage the parties to sit down at the negotiating table and work towards a ceasefire. The sanctions would target individuals and entities from the Ethiopian government, the Eritrean government, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), and the Amhara regional government if they continue to pursue military conflict over meaningful negotiations. The executive order provides the necessary authority to impose targeted sanctions against a wide range of individuals or entities if the crisis is not resolved. However, if the government of Ethiopia and the TPLF take meaningful steps to enter into talks for a negotiated ceasefire and allow for unhindered humanitarian access, the United States is ready to help mobilize assistance for Ethiopia's recovery and revitalization. The sanctions are not directed at the people of Ethiopia or Eritrea and are deliberately calibrated to mitigate any undue harm to those already suffering from the conflict. The United States will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia. The executive order is expected to be announced tomorrow, and specific names of individuals or entities to be sanctioned have not been mentioned yet. The Biden administration has been engaging with the parties involved in the conflict for months, but the situation has continued to worsen. The United States is also in close coordination with the African Union and other international partners in addressing the crisis. The hope is that the new sanctions regime will provide additional incentives for the parties to move towards a negotiated ceasefire and a political solution.
