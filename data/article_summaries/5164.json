President Biden's American Rescue Plan includes significant investments to support low- and middle-income parents who have been facing financial strain, exacerbated by the pandemic. The administration is announcing Child Tax Credit Awareness Day on June 21st to ensure parents are aware of the expansion of the Child Tax Credit and how it will benefit their families. The administration is encouraging elected officials, organizations, and faith-based groups to help low-income families use a new sign-up tool for the Child Tax Credit to help lift their children out of poverty. Additionally, the administration is releasing guidance for three elements of the American Rescue Plan that will support families, including funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, an expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, and extended support for paid sick and family leave for small and midsize employers. These measures aim to cut child poverty in half and support parents with the costs of raising children, child care, and returning to work. The Biden administration is also calling to extend tax relief for working families and increase access to high-quality child care and paid family and medical leave through the American Families Plan and American Jobs Plan. The pandemic has caused economic distress for many families, with a significant impact on women. The administration's goal is to provide economic relief and support healthy development for children, as well as promote an equitable economic recovery.
