In this article, Vice President Kamala Harris discusses the new voting restrictions in Georgia and elsewhere in the country. She emphasizes the need for Congress to pass the For The People Act and restore the strength of the Voting Rights Act. She criticizes the Georgia legislature for attempting to prevent certain populations from exercising their right to vote. When asked about the filibuster, Harris says that President Biden was clear about taking a look at it, particularly the talking filibuster. She believes that it should not be easy to block progress in the country and that the American people need their government to act. Harris dismisses concerns about the political risks associated with accepting responsibility for addressing these issues. She also mentions that President Biden intends to be bold and focus on producing results rather than grand gestures, citing the American Rescue Plan as an example of this approach.
