President Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13617, regarding the disposition of Russian highly enriched uranium, will continue beyond June 25, 2014. The accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in Russia poses a significant threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, therefore necessitating the continuation of the emergency declaration.
