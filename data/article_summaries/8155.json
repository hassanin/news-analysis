In this article, President Joe Biden grants a full and unconditional pardon to all current United States citizens and lawful permanent residents who have committed the offense of simple possession of marijuana. This pardon applies to violations of the Controlled Substances Act and D.C. Code 48-904.01(d)(1) on or before the date of the proclamation, regardless of whether they have been charged or prosecuted for the offense. The pardon restores full political, civil, and other rights to those who have been convicted of this offense. It is important to note that this pardon only applies to the offense of simple possession of marijuana and not any other offenses related to marijuana or other controlled substances. The pardon also does not apply to individuals who were non-citizens and not lawfully present in the United States at the time of their offense. The Attorney General, through the Pardon Attorney, will administer and issue certificates of pardon to eligible applicants and will develop and announce application procedures for the pardon.
