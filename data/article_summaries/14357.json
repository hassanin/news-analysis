The article is a letter from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, requesting Congress to consider Fiscal Year 2014 Budget amendments for various government departments and agencies. The amendments do not affect the proposed budget totals but are necessary to reflect the policies assumed in the budget. The letter also includes a new provision that would allow the Secretary of the Navy to receive and retain payment in-kind for the settlement of a longstanding aircraft contract litigation. The Department of Defense amendments also include updates to the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) request, which funds military operations in Afghanistan. The letter also mentions amendments for the Legislative Branch, which are transmitted without change as a matter of tradition. Finally, President Obama urges Congress to consider his FY 2014 Budget, which aims to further deficit reduction and replace sequestration.
