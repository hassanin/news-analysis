The Ninth Circuit has ruled that the Department of Justice can prioritize federal discretionary grant dollars to support policing in cities and towns that cooperate with federal efforts to remove illegal immigrants from the country. This decision overturns a previous ruling that allowed Sanctuary City policies, which release criminal aliens into communities instead of cooperating with ICE. The Department of Justice argues that these policies put the safety and security of Americans at risk, leading to injuries and deaths. The ruling affirms the Department of Justice's right to ensure that discretionary grants are not used to support Sanctuary City policies. The statement urges citizens to demand that Democratic leaders stop supporting these policies, as they deprive Americans of their safety and freedom.
