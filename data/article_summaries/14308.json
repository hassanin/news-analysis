President Obama expresses deep disappointment over the Republican filibuster of Caitlin Halligan's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Despite having support from a majority of the Senate, a minority of Senators continue to block her nomination. The President argues that filibusters of judicial nominations should only occur in extraordinary circumstances, such as ethics or qualification issues, not ideology. He emphasizes that Halligan has always practiced law with high ethical standards and her qualifications are unquestionable. The President also highlights the negative impact of obstruction on his judicial nominees, who wait significantly longer for a vote compared to his predecessor's nominees. He points out that the D.C. Circuit, considered the nation's second-highest court, currently has only seven active judges and four vacancies, whereas it had at least eight active judges for over forty years. The President urges Senate Republicans to allow the Senate to express its will and confirm Halligan without further delay.
