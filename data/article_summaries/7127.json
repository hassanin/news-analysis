Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Senator in Utah's history and the longest-serving Republican Senator in the nation's history, has passed away. He was known for his tough and soft sides, and his dedication to public service. Hatch grew up in humble beginnings near Pittsburgh and was the first in his family to graduate college. He had a successful law practice before becoming a Senator. Hatch was known for his energy and passion, sponsoring or co-sponsoring more legislation than any other Senator at the time of his retirement. He was also a man of deep faith, who wrote songs and poems and looked out for the voices often unheard in our laws. He played a key role in passing important legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Hatch and former Vice President Joe Biden shared a commitment to cancer research and worked together on the Cancer Moonshot initiative. Biden praised Hatch for his serious mind, sense of purpose, and care for others. He described Hatch as an American original. Biden and his wife Jill offer their deepest sympathies to Hatch's family.
