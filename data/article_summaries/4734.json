The National Climate Task Force, led by National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, has launched a new Federal Sustainability Plan following the signing of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and President Biden's Executive Order on Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability. The plan aims to achieve five goals on carbon pollution-free electricity, zero-emission vehicle acquisitions, Buy Clean policies, net-zero emissions buildings, and net-zero emissions from overall federal operations. The Task Force discussed the implementation of the plan and its impact on climate resilience, equity, and environmental justice. The meeting also included updates on the implementation of the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan, development of a Justice40 Scorecard, and interagency collaboration on fuel efficiency, clean energy deployment, and climate resilience. The Task Force's work aligns with President Biden's commitment to reduce U.S. emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels by 2030.
