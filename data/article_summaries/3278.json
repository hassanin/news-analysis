The article discusses a proclamation made by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding restrictions on the entry into the United States of members of the Government of Nicaragua, led by President Daniel Ortega, and others who undermine democratic institutions or impede the return to democracy in Nicaragua. The proclamation highlights the suppression of human rights and democracy in Nicaragua, including the crackdown on opposition leaders, civil society leaders, and journalists in preparation for the upcoming elections. It also mentions the detention of peaceful protesters, political leaders, and journalists, as well as the abuse of political prisoners by the Ortega government. The proclamation further emphasizes the control of security services by the government, which contributes to the repression and violence against those opposed to the government. Municipal officials and the judiciary are also implicated in supporting the Ortega government's undemocratic actions. The proclamation suspends the entry into the United States of specified individuals involved in these activities, while providing exceptions for certain individuals. The Secretary of State is tasked with identifying covered individuals, and the Secretary of State and Secretary of Homeland Security are responsible for implementing the proclamation. The proclamation will remain in effect until terminated by the President.
