President Donald J. Trump is taking steps to improve healthcare price and quality transparency in order to empower patients with information. Currently, the true cost of care is often hidden from patients, preventing them from making informed decisions and limiting competition. To address this issue, President Trump aims to require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices. The goal is to foster competition and ultimately bring down healthcare costs.
