The Biden-Harris Administration is prioritizing global health security in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. They have released an annual report detailing the progress and impact of United States investments in the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) in fiscal year 2020. The GHSA was initially launched as a 5-year effort in 2014, but due to its success and global need, another 5-year plan called GHSA 2024 was introduced. GHSA 2024 aims to have over 100 countries complete an evaluation of their health security capacity, address gaps, and improve their capabilities. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting and strengthening the GHSA moving forward. They will continue to donate vaccine doses, drive global vaccination efforts, and work towards preventing future pandemics. The GHSA plays a crucial role in these efforts.
