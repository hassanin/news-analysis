Pfizer has developed an antiviral pill for COVID-19 that has shown promising results in reducing the risk of hospitalizations and death. While it still needs to undergo a full review by the FDA, the US government has secured 10 million treatment courses of the pill, with delivery starting at the end of this year and throughout 2022. The administration is preparing to make these treatments easily accessible and free. However, vaccines remain the strongest tool in fighting the pandemic, and with the authorization of vaccines for children aged 5-11, 95% of Americans are now eligible to be vaccinated. The message from the government is to get vaccinated as vaccines are safe, free, and readily available. The administration is committed to ensuring that America has the necessary tools to save lives and end the pandemic.
