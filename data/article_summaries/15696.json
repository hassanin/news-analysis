President Obama has expanded the "Educate to Innovate" campaign, which aims to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in the United States. The campaign involves partnerships with major companies, universities, foundations, non-profit organizations, and government agencies. These partnerships will attract, develop, reward, and retain outstanding educators in STEM subjects. The President announced five new public-private partnerships that will train over 10,000 new math and science teachers and support the professional development of over 100,000 existing teachers. These partnerships represent a combined commitment of over $250 million. The President also issued a challenge to federal scientists and engineers to engage in high-impact volunteering alongside STEM educators. Additionally, NASA will organize a multi-year "Summer of Innovation" enrichment program in which NASA scientists and engineers will work with teachers and students to provide cutting-edge STEM learning opportunities. The President emphasized the importance of passionate and knowledgeable teachers in preparing students to tackle the challenges of the 21st century. There is currently a teacher shortage in the STEM field, and the President's initiatives aim to address this issue and improve STEM education in the country.
