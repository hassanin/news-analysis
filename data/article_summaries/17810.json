President Obama has declared a major disaster in North Carolina due to severe storms, flooding, and straight-line winds caused by Tropical Storm Nicole. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Assistance will be available to affected individuals in six counties, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional counties may be designated for assistance. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
