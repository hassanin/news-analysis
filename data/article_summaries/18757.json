In a phone call between President Obama and President Erdogan of Turkey, they discussed the situation in Syria and the fight against terrorism. President Obama condemned recent terrorist attacks in Ankara and Diyarbakir Province and expressed concern about Syrian regime advances in northwest Syria. He called for a halt to actions that heighten tensions with Turkey and the moderate opposition forces in northern Syria. President Obama stressed that YPG forces should not exploit the situation to seize additional territory and urged Turkey to show restraint by ceasing artillery strikes. The two leaders expressed support for the cessation of hostilities in Syria and called on Russia and the Assad regime to halt airstrikes against moderate opposition forces. They also pledged to deepen cooperation in the fight against terrorism, including the PKK, and to ultimately destroy ISIL.
