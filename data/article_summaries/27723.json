Karen Pence, the Second Lady of the United States, recently spoke at the Creative Forces Arts and Military Conference in Texas about the importance of arts therapies in healing the invisible wounds of war. The Creative Forces: NEA Military Healing Arts Network connects clinics and installations with the local community to develop arts programs for military personnel, veterans, and families. Pence also visited Fort Hood, where she met with art and music therapists who shared powerful stories of how these therapies have helped service members. One example was an infantry soldier who created a memory box with dog tags representing his fallen friends. Another service member used art therapy to express the complexities of wearing a mask every day. Music therapy was also highlighted, with a story of a service member using drumming to overcome PTSD and chronic pain. Pence emphasized that military spouses and family members can also benefit from creative arts therapy. She hopes to continue sharing stories about her visits to elevate art therapy.
