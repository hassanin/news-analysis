President Donald J. Trump participated in a signing ceremony with Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Nayef, and Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman. The meetings emphasized the United States' commitment to Saudi Arabia's security, stability, and prosperity, as well as the importance of addressing regional challenges such as defeating ISIS and al-Qa'eda, countering Iran's activities, and resolving conflicts in Yemen and Syria. The President and King Salman signed a Joint Strategic Vision Statement to collaborate on countering extremism and terrorism financing, as well as advancing defense cooperation. They also discussed Saudi Arabia's economic reform plans and promoted U.S. companies as partners for Saudi Arabia's economic transformation. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was present as well, and the signing ceremony included almost $110 billion worth of defense capabilities to support Saudi Arabia's long-term security against Iranian threats and contribute to counterterrorism operations in the region. This package demonstrates the U.S.' commitment to its partnership with Saudi Arabia and creates potential job opportunities for American companies.
