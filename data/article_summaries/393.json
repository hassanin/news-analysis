The Biden administration expressed deep disappointment in the recent DACA ruling by the District Court in Southern Texas. President Biden had previously issued a memorandum to preserve and strengthen the DACA policy on his first day in office. The administration has defended DACA from legal challenges and implemented a final rule to formalize the policy. The ruling deemed DACA unlawful, but the administration plans to continue defending it and will process renewals for current recipients while also accepting new applications. The administration remains committed to protecting Dreamers and urges Congress to provide permanent protection for them.
