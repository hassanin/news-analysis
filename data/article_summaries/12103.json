In this article, President Barack Obama transmits an alternative plan for monthly basic pay increases for members of the uniformed services for 2016. He expresses his commitment to supporting the uniformed service members who have made significant contributions to the nation over the past decade of war. However, due to economic conditions and budget constraints, he determines that it is appropriate to set the 2016 monthly basic pay increase at 1.3 percent. He states that this decision is consistent with his fiscal year 2016 Budget and will not significantly impact the government's ability to attract and retain well-qualified members for the uniformed services. The adjustments will take effect on January 1, 2016.
