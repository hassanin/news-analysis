This article discusses a recent executive order issued by President Barack Obama regarding the situation in Libya. The order expands the scope of a national emergency declared in 2011, citing ongoing violence, human rights abuses, and the misappropriation of Libya's natural resources as threats to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The order blocks the property and interests of individuals determined to be responsible for actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Libya, as well as those involved in attacks, human rights violations, or the illicit exploitation of Libya's resources. The order also suspends entry into the United States for any alien meeting these criteria. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, has been delegated the authority to take necessary actions to implement the order. All agencies of the United States Government are directed to comply with the provisions of the order.
