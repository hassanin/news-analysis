President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of New Mexico due to a severe winter storm and extreme cold temperatures that occurred between February 1-5, 2011. This declaration allows for Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The affected areas include several counties and tribal jurisdictions in New Mexico. Thomas J. McCool has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the region. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA.
