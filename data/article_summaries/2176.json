In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. addresses the rising number of adults diagnosed with diabetes in the United States. Currently, over 34 million American adults have diabetes, and an estimated 88 million more are at risk of developing the disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed heightened risks for individuals with diabetes, particularly for Black, Brown, and Indigenous Americans who face a disproportionate risk of being diagnosed with diabetes. Additionally, more young Americans are living with Type 2 diabetes, increasing their risk of serious health problems later in life. The high cost of insulin has also been a challenge for those diagnosed with diabetes. To combat this, President Biden has proposed the establishment of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) to accelerate research on detecting, treating, and curing diseases like diabetes and Alzheimer's. The American Rescue Plan has provided funding to address diabetes and other chronic diseases, strengthen public health infrastructure, and combat hunger and food insecurity. President Biden has also called on Congress to give Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices, especially for companies with limited competition. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is being reinforced to improve coverage for nearly 2 million American adults with diabetes. The ACA connects individuals with services and healthcare providers for appropriate testing, prevention, and treatment. Efforts are also being made to raise awareness and prevent Type 2 diabetes through lifestyle changes, increased physical activity, and healthy eating. The CDC offers an online risk test to help individuals learn about their risk factors for diabetes. The article concludes by commemorating the 100th anniversary of the discovery of insulin and recommitting to improving treatment for all types of diabetes. President Biden proclaims November 2021 as National Diabetes Month and calls upon various organizations and groups to participate in activities that raise awareness and help prevent, treat, and manage the disease.
