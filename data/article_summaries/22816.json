The Obama Administration is hosting a "White House Forum on Antibiotic Stewardship" to bring together stakeholders involved in antibiotic stewardship. Over 150 food companies, retailers, and human and animal health stakeholders are committing to implement changes over the next five years to slow the emergence of resistant bacteria and prevent the spread of resistant infections. The President will sign a memorandum directing Federal departments and agencies to create a preference for meat and poultry produced according to responsible antibiotic-use. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will announce finalized changes to the Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) regulation, bringing the feed-use of antibiotics under the oversight of licensed veterinarians. This builds on previous steps taken by the Administration to combat antibiotic resistance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that drug-resistant bacteria cause two million illnesses and about 23,000 deaths each year in the United States alone. The article also highlights commitments from various stakeholders, including hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare organizations, food producers, and retailers, to improve antibiotic use and prescribing practices.
