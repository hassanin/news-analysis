First Lady Michelle Obama will be joining local students and school nutrition directors to harvest the summer crop from the White House Kitchen Garden. This garden was planted in 2009 to start a national conversation about the health and well-being of the nation, which led to the Let's Move! initiative. Let's Move! has brought together various stakeholders to improve the health of children in the country. The First Lady has invited school children from Washington, D.C. schools and school nutrition directors from Orlando, FL, Dallas, TX, and West Virginia to participate in the harvest. These school nutrition directors have seen success in implementing the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, resulting in 90% of schools meeting modern nutrition standards. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is working to provide more assistance to help the remaining schools meet these standards. The event will be livestreamed on the White House website.
