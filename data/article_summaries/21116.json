In his remarks to the United Nations General Assembly, President Obama expressed his support for the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living peacefully side by side. He acknowledged the challenges and pessimism surrounding the peace process but emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement. He argued that without a resolution, both Israelis and Palestinians would suffer, and the conflict would continue to cause bloodshed. President Obama called on both sides to take responsibility for the peace process and for the international community to support their efforts. He urged those who support Palestine to help build its institutions and called for an end to efforts to undermine Israel's legitimacy. President Obama highlighted the courage of President Abbas and criticized those who use violence against innocent Israelis. He urged a change in approach, focusing on the aspirations of the young people in Gaza and Sderot, and drawing upon the teachings of tolerance in the region. He concluded by stating that if everyone worked together, a new member of the United Nations—an independent state of Palestine—could be achieved.
