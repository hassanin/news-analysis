White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki gave a briefing covering a range of topics. She began by discussing the latest jobs report, which showed progress but also highlighted the long road ahead to recover from the economic impact of the pandemic. Psaki emphasized the need for Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan to support job creation and provide relief to struggling Americans.

Psaki also mentioned that President Biden and Vice President Harris would receive an economic briefing and participate in a roundtable with individuals benefiting from relief checks from the American Rescue Plan. She highlighted a virtual listening session hosted by senior White House officials with Asian American and Pacific Islander advocates to address anti-Asian harassment and violence.

Psaki announced that President Biden would sign two executive orders to advance gender equity and opportunity for women. She also mentioned upcoming events, including a visit to a veteran's vaccination center, a small business benefiting from a Paycheck Protection Program loan, and an event in Baltimore with the CEOs of Johnson & Johnson and Merck.

Psaki addressed questions about President Biden's delay in holding a press conference, stating that the President takes questions multiple times a week and that a full press conference would be held in the coming weeks. She also discussed the administration's approach to the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) and the labor force participation rate.

Other topics covered in the briefing included the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine distribution, infrastructure plans, the filibuster, immigration policies, technology issues, and international relations. Psaki reiterated the President's commitment to supporting transgender rights and HBCUs, and expressed concern about the use of vaccines as a means of diplomacy by Russia and China. She also addressed questions about the World Health Organization's COVID-19 investigation and the President's call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
