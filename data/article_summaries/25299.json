President Donald J. Trump will pardon the National Thanksgiving Turkey on November 21st. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the National Thanksgiving Turkey presentation. After the pardoning, the turkeys will be taken to Virginia Tech's "Gobblers Rest" exhibit for care and public viewing. The turkeys were raised in Western Minnesota by National Turkey Federation Chairman Carl Wittenburg, his wife, and five young women from the Douglas County 4-H chapter. Additionally, the First Family will donate two turkeys from Jaindl's Turkey Farm to Martha's Table in Washington, D.C.
