Vice President Biden has announced the appointment of Caroline "Carrie" Bettinger-López as the new White House Advisor on Violence Against Women. Bettinger-López is a prominent advocate for gender-based equality and human rights, and has worked at various levels to combat violence against women. She is replacing Lynn Rosenthal, who left earlier this year. In her new role, Bettinger-López will advise the President and Vice President on domestic violence and sexual assault issues, collaborate with federal agencies, and develop new initiatives and policies to address violence against women. The Biden Administration has taken several steps to combat violence against women, including efforts to combat campus sexual assault, prevent domestic violence homicides, and extend protections to women of color and LGBT Americans who have been victims of violence.
