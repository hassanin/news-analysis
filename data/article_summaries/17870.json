The White House has announced new programs and investments to help address the barriers that prevent adolescent girls in Morocco from attaining an education. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will invest nearly $100 million in a new model for secondary education in Morocco, which is expected to benefit 100,000 students, including 50,000 adolescent girls. The investment will focus on mentoring programs, internships, upgrading facilities for girls, and gender responsive training for teachers. Additionally, USAID will invest $400,000 to establish five new girls' dormitories and provide support for rural girls to continue their education. Morocco will also become the newest Peace Corps Let Girls Learn country, where volunteers will work with communities to address barriers to girls' education. These new programs and investments are part of the Let Girls Learn initiative, launched by the President and First Lady in 2015, which aims to ensure adolescent girls across the world receive a quality education.
