The United States is launching the Declaration for the Future of the Internet (DFI) in response to the rise of digital authoritarianism and the challenges it poses to freedom of expression, independent news sources, elections, and human rights. The DFI is a joint effort with more than 50 partner countries and aims to promote an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet. It reaffirms the multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance and aims to protect and promote basic human rights online. The Declaration will be complementary to existing processes and institutions and will remain open for other countries to endorse. The United States and its partners will work together to implement the principles and promote the shared vision globally while respecting each other's regulatory autonomy. The DFI is part of a comprehensive set of tools and policies to promote the United States' vision of the Internet and global digital connectivity. It includes efforts to promote Open RAN 5G technologies, finance trusted telecommunications networks, share cybersecurity information, and support Internet freedom. The DFI is not about cyber warfare but focuses on state behavior and aims to counter the splintering of the Internet. While big tech companies are consulted, the primary focus is on state behavior and the struggle between democracies and authoritarian governments.
