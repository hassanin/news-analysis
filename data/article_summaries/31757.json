President Donald J. Trump has issued a letter to America's governors, highlighting the efforts his administration has made in responding to COVID-19. He announces the purchase of 150 million rapid point-of-care tests from Abbott Laboratories, which are made in America. These tests will help protect vulnerable populations and allow the country to reopen schools and get people back to work. The tests have already been distributed to higher-risk populations, including those affected by natural disasters, assisted living centers, nursing homes, HBCUs, and Native American communities. The administration will continue to provide these tests to vulnerable populations until the end of the year. Additionally, 100 million tests will be provided to governors free of charge, and it will be the responsibility of each state to distribute and administer them. The tests can be used to support in-person education, test frontline healthcare workers, those living with high-risk individuals, emergency responders, and communities at high risk, including African American and Hispanic American communities. President Trump emphasizes that the United States is leading the world in testing and will continue to work with states to defeat the virus.
