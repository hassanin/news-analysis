The President has been advocating for a balanced plan to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion. This plan includes cuts in domestic and Pentagon spending, reforming entitlement programs, and closing tax loopholes for corporations, millionaires, and billionaires. The Senate Democrats and Republicans supported this approach, but the House Republicans walked away, insisting on balancing the budget at the expense of seniors and the middle class. In response, Senator Reid has proposed a compromise that cuts spending while protecting critical investments and the economic recovery. All the cuts in this approach were previously agreed upon by both parties. Senator Reid's plan also meets the deficit reduction criteria set by House Republicans and removes the possibility of a default through 2012. The plan would address the fiscal challenge and can be built upon with a balanced approach to deficit reduction. The White House hopes that the House Republicans will support this plan to avoid defaulting on obligations for the first time in history.
