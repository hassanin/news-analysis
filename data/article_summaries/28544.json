The article is a letter from former President Donald Trump to the Speaker of the House regarding the issuance of an Executive Order concerning the national emergency with respect to significant malicious cyber-enabled activities. The Executive Order declares additional steps to be taken to address the use of United States Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products by foreign malicious cyber actors. The order aims to impose record-keeping obligations on foreign transactions and verify the identity of persons obtaining an IaaS account. It also seeks to limit certain foreign actors' access to United States IaaS products and encourages cooperation among IaaS providers to combat foreign malicious cyber actors. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other relevant authorities, is delegated the power to exempt providers or specific types of accounts from the requirements. The heads of all executive departments and agencies are directed to implement the provisions of the Executive Order.
