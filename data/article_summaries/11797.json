This article is a speech by Vice President Joe Biden at the Recovery Act Innovation Report Event. He begins by addressing the reduction of U.S. troops in Iraq and criticizing Republican leader Mr. Boehner's economic proposals. Biden argues that the previous Republican administration caused the economic crisis and that the American people want to move forward, not go back to those policies. He then discusses the debate on taxes, stating that the President proposes to extend tax cuts for 98% of Americans, while Boehner wants to extend them for the other 2%. Biden argues that this is unnecessary and that the tax cuts for millionaires won't create jobs or economic growth. He also criticizes Boehner's lack of economic agenda and highlights the administration's support for education and innovation. Biden emphasizes the importance of innovation in driving economic growth and discusses the administration's investments in modernizing transportation, renewable energy, medical research, and building a platform for private sector innovation. He concludes by highlighting the role of government in providing the seeds for innovation, while the private sector makes them grow.
