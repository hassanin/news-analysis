The Biden Administration has emphasized the importance of cybersecurity and is committed to providing the public with actionable information to ensure online safety. Microsoft has released critical patches for Exchange servers, and it is strongly recommended that all owners and operators apply these patches immediately. The U.S. Government is leading by example and requiring all agencies to patch their Exchange servers as well. In the event that these vulnerabilities escalate into a significant incident, the government will collaborate with the private sector to manage the situation. The U.S. government discovered and informed Microsoft about these vulnerabilities, and they carefully consider national security, public, and commercial interests before disclosing a vulnerability. This disclosure demonstrates the responsible and transparent approach taken by the U.S. government in handling vulnerabilities and promoting cybersecurity.
