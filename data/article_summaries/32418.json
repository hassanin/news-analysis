On Child Health Day, President Donald J. Trump emphasizes the importance of ensuring the health and well-being of children. The administration is actively working to create environments in which families can thrive and children can reach their full potential. Efforts include the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which supports at-risk families with evidence-based home visiting programs to prevent child abuse, promote positive parenting, and improve maternal and child health. The Be Best initiative, led by First Lady Melania Trump, addresses challenges such as online habits, bullying, mental health, and substance abuse. The administration is also focused on combating the opioid crisis, which poses risks to children's long-term health. The Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act of 2018 has been signed into law to provide more funding for childhood cancer research and improve the quality of care for survivors. President Trump emphasizes the inherent dignity of every child, both born and unborn, and calls upon families, professionals, organizations, and governments to work together to ensure the safety and health of America's children. Child Health Day is recognized on the first Monday in October, as designated by Congress.
