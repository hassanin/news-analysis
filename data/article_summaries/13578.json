The White House is requesting $6.18 billion in emergency funding from Congress to enhance the U.S. government's response to the Ebola epidemic. Of this amount, $4.64 billion is for immediate response and $1.54 billion is for a Contingency Fund to address the evolving nature of the epidemic. The funding will be used to fortify domestic public health systems, contain and mitigate the epidemic in West Africa, speed up the procurement and testing of vaccines and therapeutics, and strengthen global health security. The Department of Health and Human Services will receive $2.43 billion, which includes funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to improve Ebola readiness and control the epidemic in Africa. The Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund will receive $333 million for immediate response, including the purchase of personal protective equipment and the establishment of Ebola Treatment Centers. The National Institutes of Health will receive $238 million for advanced clinical trials, while the Food and Drug Administration will receive $25 million for the development and regulation of an Ebola vaccine and therapeutics. The U.S. Agency for International Development will receive $1.98 billion to scale up the U.S. foreign assistance response in West Africa. The Department of State will receive $127 million to expand medical support and evacuation capacity, provide repatriation assistance, and support diplomatic operational needs. The Department of Defense will receive $112 million for immediate efforts aimed at developing technologies relevant to the Ebola crisis. Additionally, $1.54 billion is allocated for a Contingency Fund to ensure resources are available to respond to the evolving situation. Without this funding, agencies will be unable to control the epidemic, mitigate its impacts, ensure domestic preparedness, develop treatments and vaccines, or enhance global health security.
