President Obama announced a comprehensive infrastructure plan to renew and expand America's roads, railways, and runways. The plan includes rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, constructing and maintaining 4,000 miles of rail, and rehabilitating or reconstructing 150 miles of runway. The plan also includes an up-front investment of $50 billion to jumpstart job creation and a long-term framework to reform and expand infrastructure investments. This includes the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, integrating high-speed rail into the surface transportation program, and prioritizing investments in safety, environmental sustainability, economic competitiveness, and livability. The plan also proposes improvements to airports and the modernization of the air traffic control system. Additionally, the plan includes funding for a permanent infrastructure bank that would leverage private and state and local capital for critical projects. The focus is on enhancing competition, innovation, performance, and real analysis to ensure the best return on investment for taxpayers.
