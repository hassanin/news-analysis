Vice President Joe Biden announced a loan forgiveness program for local governments in Louisiana and Mississippi that received Special Community Disaster Loans (Special CDL) after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The program will allow these municipalities to apply for loan forgiveness if they experienced operating deficits in the three fiscal years following the storms. The new procedures will be published in the Federal Register next week. The announcement reflects the administration's commitment to assisting Gulf Coast residents by expediting assistance and forming new partnerships in the region. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considered stakeholder feedback in establishing the loan forgiveness procedures, which will go into effect 60 days from publication.
