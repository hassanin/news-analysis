The White House held a press briefing to provide an update on a credible terrorist threat that was discovered. Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, John Brennan, provided details on the actions taken by the government to ensure the safety and security of the American people. The threat involved suspicious packages that originated from Yemen and were addressed to synagogues in Chicago. The packages were identified and made inert, and efforts were made to identify and isolate any other packages of concern. The investigation is still ongoing, and the government is working closely with international partners, including the Yemeni government, to determine the full scope of the threat and the individuals responsible. There are no suspects in custody at this time. The government is taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of air travel and is working closely with state and local officials to alert potential targets of the threat. The threat level has not been raised, but security measures have been increased. The President's travel plans are not expected to change, and the government will continue to update the public as more information becomes available.
