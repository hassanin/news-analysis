President Biden and Vice President Harris have announced the launch of the White House Internship Program, where interns will be paid for the first time in recent history. This move aims to remove barriers to equal opportunity for low-income students and first-generation professionals, allowing them to contribute their talents and skills to the country. The funding for paid internships comes from bipartisan legislation signed by the President earlier this year. The program will be hosted in-person on the White House campus for the Fall 2022 session, with a 14-week duration. Interested candidates can find the application and additional information at WH.gov/intern. Program participants must be U.S. citizens and meet certain criteria. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to building an Administration that reflects the diversity of America, and encourages all interested and qualified individuals to apply.
