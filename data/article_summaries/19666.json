On April 15, 2014, the President signed a law called the "Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act" (S. 404). This law clarifies that a specific wilderness area in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest in Washington does not prevent the operation and maintenance of the Green Mountain Lookout. Additionally, the law directs the Secretary of the Interior to issue a patent for an Alaska Native Veteran Allotment located in the Yukon-Delta National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
