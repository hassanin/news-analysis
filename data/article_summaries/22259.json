First Lady Michelle Obama has announced the release of $851 million in grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to upgrade and expand community health centers. The grants aim to address immediate health center facility and equipment needs and increase access to healthcare for millions of Americans. The funds will support the construction, repair, and renovation of over 1,500 health center sites nationwide, as well as the purchase of new equipment and the adoption of electronic health records. Community Health Centers, which provide preventive and primary care services regardless of a patient's ability to pay, serve more than 17 million patients, 40% of whom have no health insurance. This is the third set of grants provided through the Recovery Act for health centers.
