Local news outlets across the country are reporting on the positive economic recovery under President Biden. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data for September shows historic job growth and record low unemployment rates in several states. In Wisconsin, the unemployment rate is below the national average at 3.2%, compared to the national average of 3.5%. Jared Bernstein, one of President Biden's economic advisors, highlighted the strength of Wisconsin's economy and praised the president's efforts in reducing the deficit by $1.4 trillion. This news is seen as further evidence that President Biden's economic agenda is working and that the U.S. economy is transitioning from a strong recovery to steady and stable growth.
