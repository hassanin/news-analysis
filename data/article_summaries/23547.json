President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Georgia in response to the damage caused by Hurricane Matthew. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding is available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures in certain counties. Warren J. Riley has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are ongoing and more counties may receive assistance after assessments are complete. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
