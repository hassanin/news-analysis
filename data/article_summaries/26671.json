President Donald Trump issued a memorandum on March 13, 2020, regarding expanding state-approved diagnostic tests for COVID-19. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of proactive measures to prepare for and respond to public health threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the need for coordination among federal, state, local, and tribal agencies, as well as the flexibility given to states in caring for their citizens. The Food and Drug Administration, in collaboration with the State of New York, allowed flexibility in expediting state-approved COVID-19 testing. The memorandum states that if additional states request flexibility to authorize laboratories within their state to develop and perform tests for COVID-19, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will take appropriate action to facilitate the request. The memorandum concludes by authorizing and directing its publication in the Federal Register.
