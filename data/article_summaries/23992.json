President Obama has designated three new national monuments to honor civil rights history in celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The monuments include the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument, which will protect the historic A.G. Gaston Motel and other nearby sites associated with the civil rights movement. The Freedom Riders National Monument in Anniston, Alabama, includes the Greyhound Bus Station where a racially integrated bus of Freedom Riders was attacked in 1961. The Reconstruction Era National Monument in South Carolina encompasses four sites that tell the story of freed former African American slaves in the Reconstruction Era South. These designations were supported by local communities, elected officials, and various stakeholders. 

President Obama also issued a Presidential Memorandum to promote diversity and inclusivity in managing public lands and waters, directing agencies to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to experience and engage in decisions about these areas. The memorandum also prioritizes building a more diverse Federal workforce. 

Additionally, President Obama expanded two existing national monuments in California and Oregon. The California Coastal National Monument was expanded by 6,230 acres to include six additional coastal sites, protecting natural resources, scenic views, and areas of cultural and historical significance. The Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument in Oregon and California was expanded to protect more than 42,000 additional acres of public land, preserving biodiversity, watershed protection, and landscape-scale resilience in the face of climate change.
