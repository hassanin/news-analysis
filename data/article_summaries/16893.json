President Barack Obama has proclaimed December 2-8, 2012, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of minority-owned businesses in the United States, stating that they are key producers in various industries and contribute to job creation and innovation. The Obama Administration has taken steps to support these businesses, such as providing access to capital, consulting, contracts, and markets through the Minority Business Development Agency. Additionally, the administration has created a centralized platform, www.BusinessUSA.gov, to help business owners find federal resources to aid in their growth and hiring. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to celebrate Minority Enterprise Development Week and recognize the contributions of minority enterprises to the nation.
