President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 15-21, 2013 as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week. In his proclamation, he highlights the importance of education in building a skilled workforce and providing opportunities for success. Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) play a crucial role in making college education accessible and affordable for all Americans, particularly as more than 20% of elementary and high school students in the country are Hispanic. The Federal Government plans to invest over $1 billion in these institutions over the next decade. The President also emphasizes the need to tackle rising college costs, expand Pell Grants, promote innovation and value in higher education, and improve student loan repayment options. HSIs help students explore their intellectual passions and prepare them for careers in various fields. The proclamation encourages public officials, educators, and all Americans to observe this week by organizing programs and activities that recognize the contributions of HSIs and their graduates to the country.
