This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to South Sudan. The national emergency was declared on April 3, 2014, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the situation in South Sudan. The situation in South Sudan, marked by violence, atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations, continues to pose a threat. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2014 will remain in effect beyond April 3, 2016. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
