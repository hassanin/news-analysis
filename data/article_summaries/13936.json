This article discusses an executive order issued by President Barack Obama to establish an emergency board to investigate a dispute between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and its locomotive engineers represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET). The dispute has not been resolved under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act. This is the second emergency board established, as the recommendations of the first board were not accepted by the parties involved. The President appoints a three-member board to investigate and report on the dispute. The parties are required to submit final settlement offers within 30 days, and the board will then submit a report to the President selecting the most reasonable offer. During this process, no changes in the conditions that led to the dispute can be made by the parties without their agreement. The records and files of the board will be maintained by the National Mediation Board upon termination. The board will terminate upon submission of the report.
