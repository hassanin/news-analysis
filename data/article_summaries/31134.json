President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act of 2018." However, he has stated that certain provisions of the Act that purport to require the executive branch to adopt specific foreign policies or direct negotiations with foreign entities will be treated in a manner consistent with the President's exclusive constitutional authorities in the area of foreign relations. Additionally, a provision of the Act that requires the Secretary of State to make legislative recommendations will be treated in a manner consistent with the President's discretion to recommend measures to Congress.
