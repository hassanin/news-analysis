President Donald Trump will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to basketball legend Robert Joseph "Bob" Cousy. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian honor in the United States and is given to individuals who have made significant contributions to the country's security, national interests, world peace, or cultural and public endeavors. Cousy, known as the "Houdini of the Hardwood," had a successful career with the Boston Celtics, winning six NBA National Championships and leading the league in assists for eight consecutive years. He was also a 13-time All-Star and won the NBA's Most Valuable Player award in 1957. Off the court, Cousy fought against racism and played a crucial role in the creation of the NBA Players Association. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971.
