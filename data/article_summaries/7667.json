Yesterday, White House officials Susan Rice and Cedric Richmond celebrated the 50th anniversary of the ratification of the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age to 18. They met with non-partisan groups focused on youth voting access and civic participation to express their gratitude for their work and highlight the President's commitment to protecting the right to vote. The groups shared updates on their efforts to increase civic participation and discussed ways the administration can further advance youth voting rights.
