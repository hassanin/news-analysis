On January 25, 2017, the President declared a major disaster in the State of Georgia due to severe storms, tornadoes, and straight-line winds that occurred on January 2, 2017. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in Dougherty County, Georgia. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and repair or replacement of damaged facilities in several other counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide can also be funded on a cost-sharing basis. Kevin L. Hannes was named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will be operational from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. local time seven days a week.
