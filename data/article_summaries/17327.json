This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2012, titled "Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation". The order aims to promote cooperation between the United States and foreign governments in terms of regulatory approaches. The order states that international regulatory cooperation can help identify approaches that are as protective as those adopted domestically and can reduce unnecessary differences in regulatory requirements. The order establishes a Regulatory Working Group to discuss and coordinate international regulatory cooperation activities. The group will develop guidelines and issue reports on the applicability and implementation of the order. Federal agencies are instructed to include a summary of their international regulatory cooperation activities in their Regulatory Plans, designate regulations with significant international impacts, and consider reforms to address unnecessary differences in regulatory requirements. Independent agencies are encouraged to comply with the order. The order does not affect existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits.
