The article discusses an executive order signed by President Barack Obama on January 30, 2009, titled "Economy in Government Contracting." The order aims to promote economy and efficiency in government contracting by making certain costs unallowable for payment, thereby reducing government expenditures. The order also emphasizes the United States' impartiality in labor-management disputes involving government contractors. It states that costs incurred to persuade employees to exercise or not to exercise their right to organize and bargain collectively will be treated as unallowable. However, costs related to maintaining satisfactory relations between contractors and their employees, such as labor-management committees and employee publications, are considered allowable. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) is tasked with adopting rules and regulations to implement the order within 150 days. The order becomes effective immediately and applies to contracts resulting from solicitations issued on or after the effective date of the action taken by the FAR Council.
