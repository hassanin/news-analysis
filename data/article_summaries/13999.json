President Obama has declared a major disaster in Iowa and authorized federal aid to assist in the recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, and straight-line winds struck the state in April 2011. The federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and repairing or replacing damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also be supported statewide. Michael R. Scott has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA.
