The White House has announced a new initiative to address patient safety and medical liability reform. The goal of the initiative is to put patient safety first, foster better communication between doctors and patients, ensure fair and timely compensation for medical injuries, and reduce liability premiums. The initiative will provide grants to states and health systems for the implementation and evaluation of evidence-based patient safety and medical liability demonstrations. The Department of Health and Human Services will allocate $25 million for this initiative, and the funding will support grants of varying sizes and complexity. The initiative will be evaluated within 18 months of its completion, and the results will be made public.
