In a speech given on Memorial Day, President Joe Biden addressed the issue of gun violence in America and called for action to prevent further tragedies. He emphasized that the proposed measures are not about taking away guns or vilifying gun owners, but about protecting children, families, and communities. Biden urged Congress to pass laws to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, raise the age to purchase firearms to 21, strengthen background checks, enact safe storage laws and red-flag laws, and repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers from liability. He also highlighted the need to address the mental health crisis associated with gun violence. The President emphasized that the majority of the American people support these measures and called on Congress to act. He expressed his belief that if Congress fails to act, the American people will make gun control a central issue in their votes. Biden concluded his speech by urging the nation to come together and take action to prevent further tragedies.
