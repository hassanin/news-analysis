In this memorandum, President Barack Obama expresses support for the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility Program, which provides entrepreneurial opportunities for individuals who are blind. The program, administered by the Department of Education, allows blind individuals to operate vending facilities on federal properties. President Obama recognizes the historic achievements of blind business managers and highlights their ability to challenge preconceived notions about disability. He directs all agencies with property management responsibilities to issue permits and contracts in compliance with the Randolph-Sheppard Program. The Secretary of Education is also instructed to submit a report on agencies' implementation of the program within one year. The memorandum concludes by stating that it does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits.
