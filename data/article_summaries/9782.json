The Obama Administration has announced new efforts to promote sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices across the country. The White House will honor 12 Champions of Change for Sustainable and Climate-Smart Agriculture who are implementing practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve environmental conditions, and grow local economies. The Administration is also recognizing the crucial role that farmers and ranchers play in mitigating the impacts of climate change. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is providing funding for over 1,100 renewable energy and energy efficiency projects to help rural small businesses and agricultural producers reduce energy usage and costs. USDA has also released eight regional climate vulnerability assessments, providing regionally specific information on the effects of climate change for farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners. Additionally, the White House will plant cover crops in the White House Kitchen Garden to improve soil quality, reduce erosion, and increase soil carbon. The National Farmers Union has committed to promoting efforts to address climate change and supports practices that avoid greenhouse gas emissions and sequester carbon.
