The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its monthly Employment Situation Report, stating that nonfarm payroll employment increased by 164,000 jobs in April 2018. This extends the longest consecutive monthly job growth streak on record, with an average of 200,000 jobs added per month in 2018. Since President Trump took office in January 2017, over 2.7 million jobs have been added to the economy, and over 3 million have been added since his election in November 2016.

The mining sector has seen a significant increase in employment, adding 84,000 jobs since the President took office, with an additional 8,000 jobs added in April alone. Construction has added 363,000 jobs since November 2016, while manufacturing has created 316,000 jobs during the same time frame.

The unemployment rate for April decreased to 3.9 percent, the lowest since December 2000. The unemployment rate for African Americans reached a series low of 6.6 percent, and the rate for Hispanics also fell to a series low of 4.8 percent.

Although the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers (age 25 to 54) declined slightly in April compared to March, it has increased significantly since President Trump's election. The rate climbed from 81.3 percent in November 2016 to 82.0 percent in April 2018, reflecting the entry of nearly 900,000 prime-age workers into the labor force. Continued pro-growth policies may further boost this number. Returning to the prime-age participation rate seen in 2007, just before the Great Recession, could bring an additional 1.3 million prime-age workers into the labor force.
