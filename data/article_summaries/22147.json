The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to engage communities across the country with a large number of uninsured individuals. The goal of the challenge is to encourage community leaders to build outreach efforts to help these uninsured individuals gain coverage through the Affordable Care Act. At the end of the open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of new Marketplace signups in participating communities to the estimated number of eligible uninsured people at the start of open enrollment. The community that makes the most progress during the challenge will receive recognition, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama. Long Beach, California is one of the 20 communities participating in the challenge. The article also provides information on health insurance coverage in California, including the number of people covered through the Health Insurance Exchange and the average monthly premiums for 2016. It emphasizes the importance of tax credits, the choice of insurance plans, and the benefits of shopping for the lowest-cost plan. The article acknowledges progress in reducing the uninsured rate in California but highlights the need for more work to cover the remaining uninsured individuals.
