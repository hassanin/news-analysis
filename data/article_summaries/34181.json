President Donald Trump has withdrawn the notice "Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations" and replaced it with a new notice. The original national emergency was declared on July 24, 2011, in response to the activities of significant transnational criminal organizations that posed a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. These organizations have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous, infiltrating foreign governments and the international financial system, which undermines democratic institutions, the rule of law, and economic markets. They also contribute to violent conflicts and support other dangerous individuals. The national emergency and the measures adopted to address it will continue beyond July 24, 2017, as these criminal organizations still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States. This decision is made in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
