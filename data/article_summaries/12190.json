President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Arkansas, ordering federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms and flooding occurred between August 8-14, 2013. The declaration makes federal funding available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to assist with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding. Kenneth K. Suiso has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
