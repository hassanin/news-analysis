President Obama released a statement mourning the passing of Van Cliburn, a renowned pianist who made a significant impact on the music world. Cliburn's talent was evident from a young age, and he gained international recognition after winning the first International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow at the age of 23. He became a cultural ambassador for the United States, particularly in the former Soviet Union, and his music played a role in easing tensions during the Cold War. President Obama personally had the privilege of hearing Cliburn play and believes his art will continue to be appreciated for years to come. The President and First Lady extend their condolences to Cliburn's loved ones.
