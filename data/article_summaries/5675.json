The article is a transcript of a teleconference discussing the President's Fiscal Year 2022 Budget. Shalanda Young, Acting Director of OMB, and Cecilia Rouse, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, provided an overview of the budget and its key priorities. The budget focuses on reinvesting in areas like public health, education, basic science, and clean energy. It includes the American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan, which aim to boost the economy, create jobs, and ensure that the wealthiest Americans and big corporations pay their fair share. The budget also calls for investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and reducing the costs of prescription drugs. The speakers emphasized that the budget improves the long-term fiscal outlook and that the upfront investments are more than paid for through permanent tax reforms. They addressed concerns about the rising national debt and emphasized that the budget takes advantage of historically low interest rates to make necessary investments. The speakers acknowledged that the economic forecast in the budget was made in February and does not fully reflect the current economic reality and the impact of the proposed plans. They highlighted the importance of investing in innovation and public goods to build a robust and inclusive economy. The budget does not provide a racial equity breakout but emphasizes that agencies have been instructed to implement programs with a focus on racial equity. The speakers also addressed questions about the growth projections, the expiration of the Trump tax cuts, and the impact of inflation on consumer purchasing power.
