In a press briefing, Press Secretary Jay Carney and Chief Technology Officer Todd Park discussed the release of data on hospital charges by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The data revealed significant price variations between hospitals for the same procedures, both within and across regions. The release of this data is part of the Affordable Care Act's push for transparency in healthcare pricing and aims to empower consumers to make more informed decisions about their healthcare. The briefing also touched on other topics such as the situation in Syria, the Benghazi attack, and the immigration bill.
