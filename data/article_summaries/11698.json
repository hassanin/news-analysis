The Treasury Department has announced new guidelines on executive pay for financial institutions receiving government assistance during the financial crisis. The measures aim to ensure that public funds are used to strengthen the economy and not for inappropriate private gain. The guidelines seek to align executive compensation with the interests of shareholders, financial institutions, and taxpayers. The restrictions include limiting total compensation to $500,000 for senior executives, except for restricted stock awards. Additional pay must be in restricted stock that can only be cashed in after the government has been repaid. Companies must disclose their executive compensation structure and be subject to a non-binding shareholder resolution. Provisions to claw back bonuses and restrict golden parachutes for executives engaged in deceptive practices are also introduced. The guidelines also require boards of directors to adopt company-wide policies on luxury expenditures. The Treasury also intends to issue guidance on executive compensation requirements for future capital access programs. The long-term regulatory reform includes reviewing compensation strategies to align with risk management and long-term value and growth, requiring compensation committees to review and disclose strategies, incentivizing long-term perspective for executives, and passing non-binding shareholder resolutions on executive compensation. The Treasury will host a conference to gather input and establish best practices and guidelines for executive compensation arrangements in financial institutions.
