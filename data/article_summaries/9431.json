President Obama announced that Patricia "Pat" Summitt, former head coach and current head coach emeritus of the University of Tennessee's women's basketball team, will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This is the nation's highest civilian honor, given to individuals who have made significant contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, or significant public or private endeavors. Coach Summitt is the all-time winningest NCAA coach and has taken Tennessee to more Final Four appearances than any other coach. She has received numerous awards, including being named Naismith Women's Collegiate Coach of the Century. Off the court, Coach Summitt has been a spokesperson in the fight against Alzheimer's through the Pat Summitt Foundation Fund. The foundation provides education, support, and research for early onset dementia and Alzheimer's. Coach Summitt was notified last week of the President's decision, and the awards will be presented at a White House ceremony later this year.
