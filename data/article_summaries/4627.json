The Biden-Harris administration has released the first comprehensive federal digital assets framework. The framework aims to position the US as a leader in the digital assets ecosystem while protecting consumers, adhering to democratic values, and advancing global competitiveness. The administration encourages the Federal Reserve to continue its research on a US central bank digital currency (CBDC) and will launch an interagency working group to consider the policy implications of a potential CBDC for national security. The administration also plans to mitigate risks associated with cryptocurrencies, such as money laundering and financing for terrorism, by implementing a comprehensive action plan. Additionally, measures will be taken to protect consumers, investors, and businesses by scaling up investigations into digital asset market misconduct, strengthening enforcement efforts, and enhancing interagency coordination. The reports emphasize the importance of engaging with allies and partners to reinforce US technological and financial leadership globally.
