President Biden and Senate Democrats have made judicial nominations a top priority, resulting in a record number of confirmations. So far, Biden has seen 136 federal judges confirmed, surpassing the numbers of Presidents Trump, Obama, and George W. Bush at this point in their presidencies. What makes these nominations particularly significant is the fact that two-thirds of the nominees are women and two-thirds are people of color, many with progressive backgrounds in the law. In the last month alone, several highly-qualified, civil rights attorneys and public defenders have been confirmed as judges. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has played a key role in lining up and confirming these trailblazing nominees, some of whom could be future Supreme Court contenders. President Biden's commitment to upholding the rule of law with diverse and qualified judicial nominees has been hailed as one of his proudest accomplishments. He intends to continue pushing for more barrier-breaking nominees in the future.
