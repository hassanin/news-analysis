During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest discussed several topics including the situation in Aleppo, the cyber interference in the US election, and the one-China policy. Earnest expressed concern about the situation in Aleppo, stating that the US government continues to be deeply concerned about the violence and the risk facing innocent civilians. He also mentioned that the US had offered a ceasefire to Russia, but it was turned down. Earnest stated that the US is still interested in finding a diplomatic solution to the situation in Syria, but that optimism is not high. In regards to the cyber interference in the US election, Earnest emphasized the consensus view of the intelligence community that Russia engaged in malicious cyber activity to destabilize the political system. He also mentioned that the US supports the principle of congressional review of this matter. Earnest did not directly answer whether Russia's activities had an impact on the election outcome, but he did point out that President-elect Donald Trump had called on Russia to hack his opponent and had made other statements that could be seen as supportive of Russia. On the one-China policy, Earnest stated that the US government remains firmly committed to it and that disrupting this policy could have a disruptive effect on the ability to work with China in areas where their interests align.
