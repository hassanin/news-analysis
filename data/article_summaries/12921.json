Executive Order 13502, issued by President Barack Obama on February 6, 2009, encourages the use of project labor agreements (PLAs) for large-scale construction projects funded by the federal government. PLAs are pre-hire collective bargaining agreements that establish the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project. This executive order aims to promote efficiency and timely completion of federal construction contracts by providing structure and stability to these projects. It allows executive agencies to require the use of PLAs on a project-by-project basis, provided that it advances the government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in procurement and is consistent with the law. The order also outlines the definitions of various terms related to construction projects and sets requirements for project labor agreements, including guarantees against job disruptions and mechanisms for resolving labor disputes. It does not mandate the use of PLAs or require contractors to enter into agreements with specific labor organizations. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council is instructed to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation within 120 days to implement the provisions of this order. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is also directed to provide recommendations within 180 days on whether broader use of PLAs would help promote economical, efficient, and timely completion of construction projects receiving federal financial assistance. This order revokes previous executive orders related to PLAs and includes a severability clause to ensure that any invalid provision does not affect the rest of the order. It is effective immediately and applies to solicitations for contracts issued after the implementation of the order by the FAR Council.
