The Biden-Harris Administration has announced a series of actions as part of National Recovery Month to address the overdose epidemic and support Americans in recovery. This includes distributing $1.5 billion in funds to all states and territories. The funds will support life-saving programs and policies such as increasing access to treatment for substance use disorder, removing barriers to medications like naloxone, and expanding access to recovery support services. Various states and tribal communities, including Wisconsin, West Virginia, Arizona, Florida, Nevada, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota, Utah, Illinois, New York, Wisconsin, and Oregon, will receive grants ranging from $3.63 million to $101.3 million to combat the opioid crisis and support recovery efforts. These funds will be used for prevention campaigns, overdose prevention activities, increasing access to treatment, expanding recovery housing, and implementing media campaigns to educate patients on alternatives for pain management and supportive services.
