On October 26, 2017, the President signed two laws. The first law, H.R. 2266, provides additional funding for hurricane and wildfire relief efforts in FY 2018. It also extends temporary bankruptcy judgeships, authorizes four more temporary bankruptcy judgeships, and increases the fee payable to the U.S. Trustee for bankruptcy cases. The second law, S. 585, modifies existing whistleblower protections for Federal employees and requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a plan to prevent unauthorized access to medical records of its employees.
