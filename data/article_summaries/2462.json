The Biden Administration is implementing billing codes that will allow health insurers, including Medicare, to pay for patient navigation services for cancer patients. Patient navigators guide patients and their families through the complex world of cancer, providing support and assistance with various aspects of treatment. These services have been shown to lead to better outcomes for patients. The implementation of these billing codes will make patient navigation services more widely available to Americans. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the American Medical Association played a key role in making this possible. The hope is that with patient navigators by their side, no person will have to face cancer alone and the word "cancer" will lose its power.
