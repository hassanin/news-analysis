The article discusses the steps taken by President Obama and his administration to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States. Some of the key points mentioned in the article include:

1. Robust funding for HIV/AIDS programs, with the President's 2013 domestic HIV budget being over $22 billion dollars.

2. Implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, which focuses on making smarter and coordinated investments in science, prevention, and treatment.

3. Advocacy for increased federal funding for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program to ensure access to life-extending treatment for all Americans living with HIV/AIDS.

4. Implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which will increase HIV testing and access to treatment for 30 million Americans, including populations at highest risk for HIV such as African-Americans and Latinos.

5. Addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination, including lifting the HIV entry ban and prohibiting coverage based on pre-existing conditions, including HIV, under the Affordable Care Act.

6. Support for groundbreaking research by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to develop new life-extending HIV treatments and prevention technologies.

The article also highlights the significant progress made in HIV prevention and treatment, with successful prevention efforts averting more than 350,000 new infections and mother-to-child transmission of HIV dropping by more than 90% since the early 1990s. However, it emphasizes that there are still challenges, with approximately 50,000 new HIV infections in the United States each year and nearly 20% of people living with HIV unaware of their infection.

To address these challenges, the article mentions the creation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) and the involvement of various federal departments and agencies in the response to the epidemic. The NHAS has four main goals: reducing new HIV infections, increasing access to care, reducing HIV-related health disparities, and achieving a more coordinated national response. The article also highlights the role of departments such as NIH, CDC, Health Resources and Services Administration, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in addressing the epidemic.

Looking ahead, the article emphasizes the importance of evidence-based approaches for effective HIV prevention and treatment. This includes expanding healthcare coverage, supporting prevention efforts, reducing stigma and discrimination, supporting scientific research, and focusing efforts on populations most at risk for HIV, such as gay men and women of color.
