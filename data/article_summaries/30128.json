The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has a history of inaccurately predicting the impact of healthcare legislation on insurance coverage. For example, the CBO estimated that 25 million people would have coverage under Obamacare by now, but only 10.3 million are actually enrolled. The CBO's past inaccuracies contribute to its misleading analysis of insurance coverage under the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA). The CBO's starting point for scoring the BCRA is also incorrect, as it assumes that 15 million people should be enrolled through Obamacare's exchanges currently. The CBO has been consistently wrong in its analysis of Obamacare since 2010, and its current predictions on repealing and replacing Obamacare are based on outdated information.
