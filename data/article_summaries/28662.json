The United States expresses deep concern over the escalating conflict in Libya and strongly opposes foreign military involvement, including the use of mercenaries and private military contractors by any side. The US warns that foreign powers exploiting the conflict by establishing a lasting military presence or controlling Libyan resources pose significant threats to regional stability and global commerce. President Trump has engaged with various world leaders on the issue and it is recognized that there is no "winning" side in Libya. The US calls for a united effort by Libyans to reclaim sovereignty and rebuild their country. The US is actively engaging diplomatically with Libyan and external stakeholders to find a solution that supports Libyan sovereignty and protects the interests of the United States, its allies, and partners. The US urges all parties involved to allow the National Oil Corporation to resume its work transparently, implement a demilitarized solution for Sirte and al-Jufra, respect the UN arms embargo, and finalize a ceasefire through UN-led military talks.
