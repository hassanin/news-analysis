The Trump Administration has completed nearly 400 miles of new border wall system and has been taking action to prosecute and deport violent criminals, stop the flow of illegal drugs, and close loopholes benefiting human smugglers. The refugee system, which was meant to provide temporary refuge for victims of war and persecution, had become a racket, benefitting resettlement experts and slumlords at the expense of American communities. With the implementation of the border wall and other measures, apprehensions for illegal immigration dropped by 70% between May and August. Law enforcement also seized significant amounts of drugs, including cocaine, meth, and fentanyl. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf attributes this progress to the will and vision of President Trump and the hard work of various agencies. Illegal immigration has negative consequences for everyone, empowering criminals, supporting human smugglers, and fueling transnational gangs. It also hinders both legal immigrants and U.S. citizens from achieving the American Dream, endangers law enforcement officers, destabilizes communities, and puts law-abiding workers and businesses at a disadvantage. Open borders would exacerbate these issues and erode Americans' trust in their government. A safe and strong country requires a safe and strong immigration system.
