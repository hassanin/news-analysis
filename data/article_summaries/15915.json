President Obama has proposed the expansion of two Small Business Administration (SBA) lending programs to help small businesses during a difficult period in credit markets. The first proposal is to allow the refinancing of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans under the SBA's 504 program. Currently, 504 loans cannot be used for refinancing, so this change would help current borrowers who are facing difficulties in refinancing their loans. The second proposal is to temporarily increase the maximum loan size for SBA Express loans from $350,000 to $1 million. This would expand the program's ability to help a wider range of small businesses through a streamlined approval process. These proposals are part of the President's broader small business agenda, which includes other measures such as extending small business expensing, eliminating capital gains taxes for small businesses, and providing tax credits for job creation.
