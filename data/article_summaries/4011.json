Lowell Weicker and the author served together in the U.S. Senate for almost two decades. Weicker was known for being blunt, brave, committed to his convictions, and fiercely independent. He was involved in the Watergate hearings and later became an independent governor who prioritized doing what he believed was right over politics. Weicker had the courage to take tough stands, speak the truth, and advocate for the betterment of the country. He had an impressive record of service, including serving in the United States Army, as well as in local and state government, and as a U.S. congressman, senator, governor, and presidential candidate. He fought for disability rights and played a role in the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Weicker also worked to increase funding for medical research and disease prevention. He was guided by principle rather than party affiliation and was a strong advocate for those who couldn't always advocate for themselves. The author sends their condolences to Weicker's family and the people of Connecticut.
