The United States strongly condemns North Korea's recent launch of a space launch vehicle using ballistic missile technology. This action is a violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and poses a risk to regional and global security. The President and his national security team are closely assessing the situation with allies and partners. The US urges all countries to condemn this launch and calls on North Korea to engage in serious negotiations. While diplomacy is still an option, Pyongyang must immediately stop its provocative actions and choose engagement. The US will take necessary measures to ensure the security of its homeland and defend its allies in South Korea and Japan.
