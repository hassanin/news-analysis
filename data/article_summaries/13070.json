The White House will host the White House Tribal Nations Conference, where leaders from federally-recognized Native nations will engage with the President and Cabinet Officials on issues facing tribes. This year's Conference will focus on respecting tribal sovereignty, access to capital and credit, and protecting Native women and youth. The White House will release a new Native Youth Report that explores the challenges facing Native youth and makes recommendations for improvement. President Obama will announce the launch of Generation Indigenous (Gen I), a Native youth initiative aimed at removing barriers and improving opportunities for Native youth. The Conference will also include the participation of White House Youth Ambassadors and various programs and initiatives to support Native education, business, infrastructure, justice, and health.
