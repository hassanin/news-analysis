The White House has released a media advisory regarding press credentialing for the President's upcoming trip to Martha's Vineyard. A press file and briefing center will be set up in Oak Bluffs, and journalists must create an account and sign up at www.PressCorpsTravel.com to guarantee a workspace with access to power, internet, and other services. The deadline to sign up for press file credentials is Monday, August 10th at 5:00PM EDT. No public events are scheduled during the trip. Journalists who have previously traveled with the White House in 2009 may already have an account created for them on the website.
