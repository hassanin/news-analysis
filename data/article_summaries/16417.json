President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Missouri and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms, flooding, and tornadoes that occurred between June 12 and July 31, 2010. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided on a cost-sharing basis to assist with emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Jose M. Girot as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA.
