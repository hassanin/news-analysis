This executive order, issued by President Barack Obama, amends the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States. The amendments affect Part II, Part III, and Part IV of the manual. The order states that these amendments will take effect immediately, but they will not be applied retroactively to any acts or omissions that occurred prior to the effective date. Additionally, the order clarifies that any ongoing nonjudicial punishment proceedings, restraints, investigations, referrals of charges, or trials will not be invalidated by these amendments and can continue as if the amendments had not been made.
