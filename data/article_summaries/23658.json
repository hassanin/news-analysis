The Presidential Memorandum titled "Addressing Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Use" directs federal agencies to take action to reduce prescription pain medication and heroin overdose deaths, promote appropriate prescribing practices, and improve access to treatment. The policy highlights the devastating impact of prescription drugs, especially opioid pain medications, on drug overdose deaths. The memorandum emphasizes the need for medical professionals to receive adequate training on prescribing pain medications and the risks associated with them. It also emphasizes the importance of improved access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorders. The memorandum outlines training requirements for federal prescribers and calls for a review of health benefit requirements and policies that may hinder access to MAT. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is instructed to provide expertise and consultation to agencies on their reviews. The memorandum concludes with general provisions stating that it does not impair existing authority or create any new legal rights or benefits.
