The White House issued a memorandum on Presidential Signing Statements in March 2009. The memorandum acknowledges the long-standing practice of Presidents issuing statements to address constitutional or legal questions when signing bills into law. It recognizes that signing statements can be abused and should not be used to suggest that the President will disregard statutory requirements based on policy disagreements. However, signing statements can serve a legitimate function in our system when based on well-founded constitutional objections. The memorandum outlines principles for issuing signing statements, including informing Congress of constitutional concerns, avoiding the conclusion that parts of a bill are unconstitutional, acting with caution and restraint in determining constitutionality, promoting transparency and accountability, and seeking advice from the Attorney General on previous signing statements. The memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
