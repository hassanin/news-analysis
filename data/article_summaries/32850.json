President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, which was declared in Executive Order 12978 in 1995, is to continue beyond October 21, 2019. The President has determined that the circumstances that led to the declaration of the national emergency still exist, and the actions of these narcotics traffickers continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, as well as causing violence, corruption, and harm domestically and internationally.
