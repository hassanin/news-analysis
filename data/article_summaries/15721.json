President Barack Obama sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, requesting Congress to consider amendments to the Fiscal Year 2010 proposals in his Fiscal Year 2011 Budget for the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice. These amendments aim to enhance federal border protection, law enforcement, and counternarcotics activities in order to secure the Southwest border. The proposed budget authority for Fiscal Year 2010 would increase by $500 million, partially offset by cancelling $100 million from a lower priority program within the Department of Homeland Security. President Obama considers these proposals as emergency requirements and urges their immediate consideration.
