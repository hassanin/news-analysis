This proclamation, issued by President Donald Trump, addresses the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States. The proclamation states that aluminum articles are being imported in quantities and under circumstances that threaten to impair national security. To address this, a 10 percent ad valorem tariff is imposed on aluminum articles imported from all countries, except Canada and Mexico. The proclamation also mentions ongoing discussions with countries such as Australia, Argentina, South Korea, Brazil, and the European Union to find alternative means to address the threat to national security. If satisfactory alternative means are reached, the tariff may be removed or modified. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of maintaining the economic viability of the domestic aluminum industry and reducing reliance on foreign producers. Additionally, measures may be taken to prevent transshipment and increase strategic partnerships. The proclamation concludes by stating that any previous proclamations or executive orders inconsistent with this proclamation are superseded.
