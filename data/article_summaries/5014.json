Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm held a press briefing to discuss gas prices and the impact of Putin's price hike. She explained that the high gas prices are due to two main factors: Russia's war in Ukraine, which has led to a decrease in Russian oil exports, and supply and refining constraints caused by COVID-19. Granholm highlighted that the price increase has resulted in Americans paying an additional $2 per gallon at the pump. She also mentioned that other countries are experiencing similar price hikes.

In response to the situation, President Biden has called on Congress to suspend the national gas tax for the next 90 days to provide immediate relief to American families. Granholm emphasized that this measure alone will not solve the problem, and the President is also urging states to consider gas tax holidays, oil companies to increase output, and the industry to pass along the decrease in oil prices to consumers. Granholm mentioned that she will be meeting with major domestic refiners to discuss actions that can increase capacity and overcome supply hurdles.

Granholm stressed the importance of diversifying fuel sources and transitioning to clean energy to avoid future price shocks. She highlighted the President's commitment to clean energy and the initiatives being taken, such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and increased production of clean energy technologies.

During the press briefing, Granholm addressed questions about the passing on of gas tax benefits to drivers, consultation with Democratic leaders on the gas tax holiday, potential emergency powers, and the impact of the war in Ukraine on inflation.

In summary, Secretary Granholm discussed the factors contributing to high gas prices, the actions being taken by the Biden administration to provide relief, and the need for collaboration between government, industry, and Congress to address the issue.
