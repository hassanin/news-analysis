The United States reaffirms its commitment to eradicating torture worldwide, 35 years after the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was established. The US condemns any instance of torture, stating that even one case is too many. Recent examples of torture include Russian forces in Ukraine, terrorist groups in Mali and Burkina Faso, Kremlin-aligned Wagner mercenaries in Mali and Central African Republic, transnational crime organizations in the Americas, and security forces in Burma. The US has legally prohibited torture in all forms and is the top contributor to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. The US also submitted a budget requesting the largest ever funding amount for the US Survivors of Torture Program. The article emphasizes that when a government commits torture, it loses moral authority and undermines its own legitimacy. Furthermore, torture committed in the name of national security only strengthens enemies, fuels unrest, and isolates governments internationally. The article concludes by calling for solidarity with torture survivors and urging all nations to end this inhumane practice.
