On October 10, 2018, the President signed two laws related to healthcare. The first law, called the "Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018," prohibits Medicare Prescription Drug Plan sponsors and Medicare Advantage organizations from restricting or penalizing the disclosure of certain drug pricing information to enrollees. The second law, called the "Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act," prohibits health insurers from restricting or penalizing the disclosure of certain drug pricing information to enrollees, and also requires the filing of settlements between biosimilar product developers.
