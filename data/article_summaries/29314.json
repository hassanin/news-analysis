In a press conference held in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, President Donald Trump announced that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, has been killed. The President described Baghdadi as the world's number one terrorist leader and praised the U.S. Special Operations Forces for executing a dangerous and successful mission to eliminate him. Baghdadi was located in a compound in northwestern Syria, and during the raid, he ran into a dead-end tunnel and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three of his children. The President emphasized that no U.S. personnel were lost in the operation, and a large number of Baghdadi's fighters and companions were killed. He also thanked the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq for their support and cooperation in the mission. The President concluded by stating that Baghdadi's death demonstrates America's relentless pursuit of terrorist leaders and commitment to defeating ISIS and other terrorist organizations.
