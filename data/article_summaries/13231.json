President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, urging Congress to consider fiscal year 2017 budget amendments for national security activities. The amendments would provide $5.8 billion for Department of Defense (DOD) Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) activities, primarily to support the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and combat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Additionally, $5.8 billion would be allocated for the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to support counter-ISIL and counterterrorism objectives, including diplomatic engagement, governance, stabilization efforts, embassy security, relief and recovery needs, and humanitarian assistance. Overall, these amendments would increase the OCO funding requested for FY 2017 by $11.6 billion. President Obama also emphasizes the importance of fully funding domestic security programs, particularly cybersecurity and initiatives related to the Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration and Countering Violent Extremism programs.
