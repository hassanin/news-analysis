In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced that President Trump has signed the Right to Try Act into law, which allows terminally ill patients to try potentially life-saving drugs. Sanders also mentioned that the President will meet with families of the victims from the Santa Fe High School shooting in Texas and host the White House Sports and Fitness Day. When asked about the allegations that the FBI spied on the Trump campaign, Sanders said that there is still cause for concern and that the matter will continue to be looked into. She also mentioned that Secretary of State Pompeo is currently meeting with North Korean officials to prepare for the summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un, which is scheduled for June 12th. In addition, Sanders addressed the recent controversy surrounding Roseanne Barr's racist tweet and the media bias against the President. She also discussed the administration's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the ongoing trade negotiations with China and NAFTA. The press briefing ended with a question from a young student about school safety, to which Sanders expressed the administration's commitment to protecting children in schools.
