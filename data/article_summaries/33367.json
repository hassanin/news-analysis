On February 25, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a statement announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Cuba. This emergency was initially declared on March 1, 1996, in response to the destruction of two unarmed United States-registered civilian aircraft by the Cuban government. The national emergency was expanded in 2004 to deny support to the Cuban government and has been further modified in 2016 and 2018 due to continued disturbances of international relations related to Cuba. The Cuban government has not shown that it will refrain from using excessive force against US vessels or aircraft engaged in memorial activities or peaceful protests near Cuba. Additionally, unauthorized entry of US-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is seen as detrimental to US foreign policy as it could facilitate mass migration from Cuba, which is considered a threat to US security. Therefore, the national emergency and the emergency authority to regulate vessel anchorage and movement in relation to Cuba will continue. The notice of this continuation will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
