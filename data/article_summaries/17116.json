The White House and the Government of Canada have released the Joint United States-Canada Electric Grid Security and Resilience Strategy. This strategy aims to strengthen the security and resilience of the North American electricity grid against cyberattacks and climate change impacts. The strategy emphasizes the need for collaboration and shared approaches to risk management between the two countries. It envisions a secure and resilient electric grid that can withstand hazards and recover efficiently from disruptions. The strategy has three strategic goals: protecting the current electric grid, enhancing response and recovery efforts, and building a more secure and resilient future electric grid. Separate action plans will be implemented in the US and Canada to achieve these goals. The strategy will require collaboration between various stakeholders, including state and provincial governments, regulators, utilities, private sector partners, policymakers, and the public.
