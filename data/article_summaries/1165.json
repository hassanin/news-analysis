President Biden has announced his intent to appoint several individuals to serve as members on the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. The council was established by Congress in 1980 to lead the nation in commemorating the Holocaust and to raise private funds for and build the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The appointees include Stuart Eizenstat, who will serve as chair. Eizenstat has a long history of involvement in Holocaust justice and memory, including serving as a member of the White House staff for President Lyndon B. Johnson and as Special Negotiator for the Jewish Claims Conference. Allan M. Holt, Tom A. Bernstein, Abraham H. Foxman, Meryl Frank, Judith Gold, Marsha Z. Laufer, Samuel Lauter, Jeffrey Peck, Leah Pisar, Mark A. Siegel, and Susan K. Stern will also serve as members on the council. Each appointee brings a unique background and expertise to the council, ranging from business and legal experience to advocacy for equality and social justice.
