President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13664 regarding South Sudan will continue beyond April 3, 2019. The ongoing situation in South Sudan, which includes violence, human rights abuses, recruitment of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations, poses a significant threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Trump has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
