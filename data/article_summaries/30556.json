The Washington Post has had a summer filled with embarrassing moments, including incorrect statements and shoddy fact-checking. As the summer came to a close, the Post published an opinion article that pushed a personal political narrative claiming that President Trump had a "lost summer" with few accomplishments. However, the White House provided the Post with a detailed list of 26 important successes of the summer, of which the Post chose to publish only four. This shows media bias in both deciding what news is covered and how it is covered. The Post could have highlighted achievements such as easing federal student loan debt for disabled veterans, the president's visit to North Korea, and a trade deal with Japan. The Post also ignored the president's efforts to fix immigration loopholes and increase border security. The article criticizes the media for their biased coverage of Trump and calls for more nonpartisan reporting.
