President Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria will continue beyond May 11, 2014. The Syrian regime's brutal war on its own people, including supporting terrorist organizations and impeding the Lebanese government's functioning, poses a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The United States condemns the Syrian regime's use of violence and human rights abuses and calls for a political transition in Syria. The United States will consider changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Syrian government to determine whether to continue or terminate this national emergency in the future.
