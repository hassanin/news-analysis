The President has authorized the use of up to $50 million in assistance from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to help address urgent humanitarian needs in South Sudan. The funds will support the UN High Commission for Refugees and its partners in providing aid to the more than 300,000 refugees that have crossed into neighboring countries, as well as to internally displaced persons within South Sudan. The country has been facing months of conflict, resulting in over 1.3 million people being displaced and the risk of famine. The U.S. delegation will pledge a total of nearly $300 million in additional assistance at a conference in Oslo, bringing total U.S. humanitarian assistance since the start of the conflict to approximately $433.6 million.
