Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced a $41 million grant initiative to address the national backlog of untested sexual assault kits. This initiative is a partnership with the New York County District Attorney's Office, which is contributing an additional $38 million, bringing the total to $79 million. The grants will be awarded to 20 jurisdictions to eliminate or reduce the number of untested kits across the country. The goal is to solve previously unsolved rapes and bring rapists to justice, providing closure and safety to victims. The National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, administered by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Assistance, supports the reform of jurisdictions' approaches to evidence found in sexual assault kits. The funding will directly pay for testing kits, and it is projected to achieve testing of approximately 70,000 kits. This initiative is part of the Justice Department's ongoing effort to address sexual assault and support victims.
