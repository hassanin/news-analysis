President Donald Trump has signed into law H.R. 5515, which authorizes fiscal year 2019 appropriations for the Department of Defense (DOD) and includes provisions for military activities, military construction, and defense activities of the Department of Energy. The President applauds Congress for passing the bill, but raises concerns about several provisions that he believes restrict his authority as Commander in Chief. These provisions relate to the control of personnel and materiel, certification/notification requirements for certain military or diplomatic actions, restrictions on transferring detainees at Guantanamo Bay, dictating the position of the United States in external military and foreign affairs, violations of the Appointments Clause and separation of powers, and mandates/regulations regarding the submission or publication of privileged information. The President states that his Administration will implement these provisions while upholding his constitutional authorities.
