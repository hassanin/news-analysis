Second Lady Karen Pence, along with the First Lady of Puerto Rico, Beatriz Rossell√≥, participated in an art session with children impacted by Hurricane Maria. The session, led by art therapist Dr. Maricel Ocasio Figueroa, took place at the FEMA Interim Operations Center in San Juan. During the visit, Mrs. Pence donated 100 pounds of clay to Dr. Figueroa, who had expressed a desire to use clay with traumatized children at the shelters but couldn't afford to purchase it. Clay is a beneficial material for addressing trauma as it allows for movement, manipulation, and the expression of strong emotions. Mrs. Pence also joined the Vice President in a prayer service at Iglesia Santa Bernadita, where she led one of the prayers. Mrs. Pence has chosen art therapy as her initiative to champion and believes in its ability to enrich the lives of individuals, families, and communities. Art therapy is a profession facilitated by professional art therapists who are experts in human development, psychological theories, and counseling techniques.
