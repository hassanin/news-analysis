Vice President Joe Biden announced the expansion of the Pentagon Homeowners Assistance Program (HAP) under the Recovery Act. The program aims to help military families and Department of Defense civilians who have sold their homes at a loss. With $555 million in Recovery Act funds, the program will assist families forced to relocate due to base closures or normal assignment rotations. Priority access to the funds will be given to survivors of those killed during deployment and those who were wounded, ill, or injured during deployment. The announcement was made during Vice President Biden's visit to Naval Base Coronado in San Diego.
