The United States strongly condemns the recent terrorist attacks in Mali and Saudi Arabia. In Mali, terrorists attacked a hotel in Sévaré, killing several Malian and foreign citizens. In Saudi Arabia, a terrorist bomber attacked a mosque in Abha, resulting in the deaths of 15 Saudi servicemen. The United States expresses condolences to the families of the victims and solidarity with the governments affected. The fact that the victims came from different nations and faiths highlights the common cause in the global effort to confront and defeat terrorists. The United States will continue to support Mali and Saudi Arabia in their fight against terrorism.
