The President of the United States, Donald Trump, has declared a continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. This emergency was initially declared on November 14, 1979, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States caused by the situation in Iran. The process of implementing agreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is still ongoing, and therefore, the national emergency must continue beyond November 14, 2018. This decision is made in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. It is important to note that this renewal is distinct from a previous emergency renewal on March 12, 2018. The notice of this continuation will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
