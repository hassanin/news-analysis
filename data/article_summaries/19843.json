This executive order, issued by President Barack Obama on April 18, 2014, expands the eligibility for the Defense Meritorious Service Medal. The order amends Executive Order 12019, which established the Defense Meritorious Service Medal on November 3, 1977. The amendment allows the medal to be awarded not only to members of the Armed Forces of the United States but also to members of the armed forces of friendly foreign nations.
