During a press briefing, senior administration officials provided a summary of the declassified information about the chemical weapons attack that occurred on April 4th. The officials stated that the attack was carried out by Syrian regime-controlled SU-22 fixed-wing aircraft from the Shayrat airfield. They presented evidence, including open-source material, social media accounts, videos, imagery, and physiological samples, to support their narrative. The victimology and symptoms of the victims were consistent with nerve agent exposure, specifically sarin. The officials also discussed the Russian narrative, which they believe is false and an attempt to cover up the Syrian regime's culpability in the attack. They highlighted the close operational cooperation between the Russian and Syrian militaries and raised questions about Russian foreknowledge of the attack. The officials emphasized the need for the international community to condemn the use of chemical weapons and for the OPCW to conduct a fact-finding mission to gather more evidence. They also called on Russia to stop its disinformation campaign and work together to eliminate weapons of mass destruction from Syria.
