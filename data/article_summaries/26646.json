President Donald Trump has issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding the identification of major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries for Fiscal Year 2020. The memorandum identifies Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries. The inclusion of a country on this list does not necessarily reflect its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Bolivia and the regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela have been designated as having failed demonstrably to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of United States programs supporting the legitimate interim government in Venezuela. The memorandum also highlights the need for continued efforts to combat illicit drugs, including cooperation with countries where these drugs originate. Progress in Colombia in reducing coca cultivation and cocaine production is acknowledged, and efforts to restore democracy in Venezuela are encouraged. The memorandum calls for increased efforts by Mexico to stop the flow of drugs into the United States and emphasizes the importance of Mexico's cooperation in reducing heroin production and confronting drug trafficking. Failure to make progress in the coming year may result in determining that Mexico has failed to uphold its international drug control commitments. The memorandum concludes by authorizing the submission of this designation to Congress and its publication in the Federal Register.
