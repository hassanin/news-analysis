The President has notified Congress that approximately 275 U.S. military personnel are being deployed to Iraq to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. These personnel will assist the Department of State in relocating some staff from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to the U.S. Consulates General in Basra and Erbil, as well as the Iraq Support Unit in Amman. The deployment has the consent of the Government of Iraq, and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad will remain open with a majority of its presence intact to carry out its national security mission.
