President Donald J. Trump met with President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan in New York to discuss the implementation of President Trump's new South Asia strategy to defeat terrorism and ensure the safety of the American and Afghan people. They also discussed economic development, particularly how American companies can help develop Afghanistan's rare earth mineral resources. The two leaders agreed that such initiatives would benefit both countries by contributing to national security, growing Afghanistan's economy, and creating new jobs. This would also help reduce the costs of United States assistance as Afghanistan becomes more self-reliant.
