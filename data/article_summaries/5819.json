The article discusses the progress made in expanding access to affordable healthcare in the United States. The author, who ran for President, highlights the special enrollment period opened by their administration, which has allowed two million Americans to sign up for health insurance. This milestone is in addition to the expansion of programs like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which now cover over 81 million Americans. The author also mentions the American Rescue Plan, which has lowered healthcare costs for nine million Americans who purchase coverage through the Affordable Care Act. The plan has resulted in lower premiums, saving families an average of $50 per person per month. The author's Build Back Better agenda aims to further improve affordability by adding dental, vision, and hearing coverage to Medicare, closing the Medicaid coverage gap for low-income Americans, and making the premium reductions permanent. The article concludes by urging Americans to sign up for health coverage before the special enrollment period ends. The author also calls on Congress to pass the health care reforms in their agenda to ensure healthcare is a right for all Americans.
