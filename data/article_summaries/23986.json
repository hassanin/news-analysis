She will then visit a school assisted by the McGovern/Dole Food for Education program, where she will observe an early grade reading lesson and witness the impact of school feeding and education quality programs on student learning. Dr. Biden will also visit Mtubwi Primary School to learn about the Girls' Empowerment Through Education and Health Activity, which aims to bring drop-out girls back to school and provide them with a safe learning environment.
