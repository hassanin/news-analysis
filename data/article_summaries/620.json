President Biden has announced a series of new actions to expand COVID-19 testing and improve the availability of tests. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense (DOD) will invest $650 million to expand testing opportunities for schools and underserved populations, such as homeless shelters. HHS will establish regional coordinating centers to distribute testing supplies and partner with laboratories to collect specimens and report results. Additionally, HHS and DOD will invest $815 million to increase domestic manufacturing of testing supplies and raw materials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will invest nearly $200 million to increase virus genome sequencing, allowing for better detection and tracking of emerging strains. These investments are part of a larger plan that includes $50 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan to expand and support testing nationwide.
