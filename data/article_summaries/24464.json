In this statement, President Obama discusses the failure of the Supercommittee to reach an agreement on deficit reduction. He highlights the need for a balanced approach that includes spending cuts, slowing the growth of Medicare and Medicaid, and asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share. He criticizes Republicans for insisting on protecting tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of education and medical research. The President emphasizes that there will be $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts in 2013 if Congress does not reach an agreement. He states that he will veto any effort to undo these cuts and urges Congress to come up with a balanced plan to reduce the deficit. The President also mentions the need to cut taxes for workers and small business owners, put construction workers back on the job, and put teachers back in the classroom. He concludes by expressing his hope that Congress will work together to meet the needs of the American people.
