The White House has issued a letter stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria will continue beyond May 11, 2015. The letter highlights the Syrian regime's brutal war on its people, its pursuit of chemical and biological weapons, support for terrorist organizations, and obstruction of the Lebanese government. These actions are seen as fostering extremism and sectarianism and pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The letter also condemns the regime's use of violence and human rights abuses and calls for a political transition towards greater freedom, democracy, and justice in Syria. The United States will consider changes in the Syrian government's composition, policies, and actions in the future to determine whether to continue or terminate the national emergency.
