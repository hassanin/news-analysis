On October 7, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 2701, the "Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010." This act is the first intelligence authorization act enacted in almost six years and contains provisions that will assist in the effective execution of Intelligence Community programs. One provision allows for information sharing between intelligence community elements and the National Counterterrorism Center and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The President's Administration provided a letter to Congress summarizing their understanding of how certain sections of the bill would be interpreted. Section 331 addresses the reporting of sensitive intelligence matters, and the President's interpretation allows for a "general description" of covert action findings or notifications in order to protect sensitive national security information. The requirement to provide the legal basis for intelligence activities and covert actions does not require the disclosure of privileged advice or information. Additionally, section 405 establishes an Inspector General of the Intelligence Community in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The President's Administration understands that the requirement for the Inspector General to make immediate reports to congressional committees does not necessitate the disclosure of privileged or confidential law enforcement information. The whistleblower protection provisions in section 405 are also seen as consistent with a similar provision in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.
