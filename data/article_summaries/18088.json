This article is a Presidential Memorandum from January 26, 2009, addressed to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The memorandum discusses the State of California's request for a waiver under the Clean Air Act to adopt limitations on greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles. The EPA had previously denied California's application for this waiver, and the memorandum requests an assessment of whether the denial was appropriate based on the Clean Air Act. It further requests that the EPA take any appropriate action based on this assessment. The memorandum concludes by stating that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. The memorandum is authorized to be published in the Federal Register.
