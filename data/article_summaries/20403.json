President Barack Obama has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the situation in Zimbabwe. This national emergency was initially declared in 2003 through Executive Order 13288. The emergency is related to the actions and policies of certain members of the Zimbabwean government and other individuals who have been undermining the country's democratic processes or institutions. According to Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice stating its continuation in the Federal Register and transmits it to Congress within 90 days prior to its anniversary date. President Obama has determined that the crisis caused by these actions and policies still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, he has decided to extend the national emergency and maintain the sanctions in response to this threat.
