The White House held a teleconference to discuss the upcoming Ninth Summit of the Americas and the President's agenda for the event. The summit will focus on building a sustainable, resilient, and equitable future in the Western Hemisphere. The President will address various issues, including economic prosperity, climate change, migration, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The summit will feature discussions on democratic governance, health and resilience, climate change and environmental sustainability, clean energy transition, and digital transformation. Several initiatives and partnerships will be announced, including the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, which aims to promote an equitable recovery from the pandemic. The President will also address food insecurity, health initiatives, and collaborative migration management. The participation of certain leaders, such as President López Obrador of Mexico, was a topic of discussion, but it was stated that Mexico will be represented at the ministerial level. The White House also mentioned the possibility of engaging with Juan Guaidó, the interim President of Venezuela, during the summit. The decision to not invite certain leaders considered non-democratic dictators was defended as a principled stance, although representatives from Cuba and Nicaragua were invited to participate in stakeholder forums and other events. The President will have a bilateral meeting with President Bolsonaro of Brazil, despite disagreements between the two countries. The White House expressed confidence in the commitments made at the summit, even in the absence of some key heads of state. The short-term, medium-term, and long-term objectives of the summit were discussed, with an emphasis on building a strong foundation for future progress.
