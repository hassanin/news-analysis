The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a fact sheet on big data and privacy. The fact sheet discusses the impact of big data on various aspects of society, such as public safety, healthcare, education, and agriculture. It also highlights the challenges raised by big data in terms of privacy protection. President Obama asked his Counselor John Podesta to lead a 90-day review of big data and privacy, which included input from various stakeholders. The review presented findings and recommendations to the President, focusing on seizing opportunities presented by big data and preserving values such as privacy. The fact sheet includes six policy recommendations, including advancing consumer privacy rights, passing national data breach legislation, extending privacy protections to non-U.S. persons, ensuring appropriate use of student data, addressing discrimination facilitated by big data, and amending the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
