In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. proclaims September 24 through September 30, 2023, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Week. He emphasizes the importance of supporting and investing in HBCUs to provide quality education and empower students. HBCUs have a rich history of producing talented individuals who have made significant contributions to various fields, including engineering, law, medicine, and the arts. Despite their contributions, HBCUs often lack the same financial resources as other institutions, which limits their potential. President Biden's administration has provided over $7 billion to HBCUs and established the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for HBCUs. The administration also aims to make higher education more accessible and affordable, including increasing the maximum Pell Grant and implementing a student debt relief plan. Additionally, President Biden vows to protect HBCU campuses from domestic extremist threats. The article concludes by highlighting HBCUs' role in opening doors of opportunity for students and fostering positive change in society.
