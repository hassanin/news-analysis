The White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, held a press briefing on August 31, 2011. During the briefing, Carney discussed the upcoming speech by President Obama to a joint session of Congress. He explained that the President believes significant action needs to be taken to spur economic growth and create jobs, and that action can be achieved by working together with Congress. Carney also addressed questions about the timing of the speech, which coincides with a Republican debate, and explained that the timing was not specifically chosen to conflict with the debate. He emphasized that there are many opportunities for the American people to hear from both the President and the candidates in the debate. Carney also discussed the focus of the speech, which will be on the immediate need to create jobs and spur economic growth. He explained that the President will present detailed proposals for deficit reduction to a joint committee in Congress at a later date. Carney also addressed questions about the housing market, Syria, and the 9/11 Commission recommendations. He reiterated the administration's commitment to taking measures to help restore the health of the housing market and to pressure the Syrian regime to allow the Syrian people to determine their own future. Carney also acknowledged that there is still work to be done in implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, but emphasized that the administration is focused on continually improving and taking steps to protect the homeland and fight terrorism.
