The Biden-Harris Administration has approved an additional $4.8 billion in student debt cancellation for 80,300 people. This brings the total approved debt cancellation to $132 billion for over 3.6 million Americans. The relief is aimed at fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and ensuring that borrowers who have been in repayment for at least 20 years receive the relief they are entitled to. The administration has also made efforts to increase Pell Grants, fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and create the SAVE plan, the most generous Income-Driven Repayment plan in history. The administration is continuing to pursue alternative paths to provide debt relief to as many borrowers as possible.
