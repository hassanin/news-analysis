The Administration supports H.R. 3004, also known as Kate's Law, which increases penalties for criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry. The bill is in response to the shooting of Kate Steinle, a woman who was killed by an illegal immigrant with a criminal history. The Administration believes that the bill will deter reentry and help keep criminal aliens off the streets. If the bill is presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he sign it into law.
