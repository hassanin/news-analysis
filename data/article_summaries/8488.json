The Biden-Harris Administration is focused on lowering costs for families and maintaining economic gains. Annual inflation is lower than seven months ago, gas prices have decreased, and unemployment remains low. Families are now less likely to be delinquent on bills and mortgages, and more likely to have health insurance. The President's Inflation Reduction Act is reducing costs for prescription drugs, healthcare, and energy while lowering the deficit. The Administration has taken actions to eliminate fees, address supply chain issues, promote competition, and create manufacturing jobs. Congressional Republicans, on the other hand, have proposed actions that would raise costs for working- and middle-class families while benefiting the wealthy and corporations. The President's Budget aims to lower everyday costs for Americans, including healthcare, childcare, education, utilities, and more.
