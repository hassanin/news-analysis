President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 2010 as National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. The proclamation highlights the importance of supporting those in recovery and increasing access to treatment and recovery programs. The theme for this year's Recovery Month is "Join the Voices for Recovery: Now More Than Ever!" The proclamation encourages all Americans to observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and to celebrate the lives freed from addiction. It also emphasizes the role of family members, mutual aid groups, peer support programs, health professionals, and community leaders in providing compassion, care, and hope. The Affordable Care Act is mentioned as a means to support services for addiction. The proclamation concludes by calling on Americans to spread the message that substance abuse is preventable, addiction is treatable, and recovery is possible.
