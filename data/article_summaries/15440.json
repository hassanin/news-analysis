On January 21, 2009, White House Counsel Greg Craig released a statement regarding the oath of office of President Barack Obama. The statement acknowledges that the oath was administered effectively and the President was sworn in appropriately. However, due to one word being out of sequence, Chief Justice Roberts administered the oath a second time as a precaution.
