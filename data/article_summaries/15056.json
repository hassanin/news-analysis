The Precision Medicine Initiative, launched by President Obama in 2015, aims to provide personalized treatment to patients based on their health history, genes, environment, and lifestyle. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other organizations are investing in research and data capacity to develop more effective ways to improve health and treat disease. The initiative also focuses on engaging participants in research and returning results to them in user-centered ways. Private-sector organizations are making commitments to accelerate precision medicine by making it easier for patients to access their health data, engaging participants in research, bringing precision medicine to everyone, opening up data and technology tools, adhering to strong privacy and data security principles, and advancing precision medicine approaches in clinical practice.
