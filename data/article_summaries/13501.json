The Middle Class Task Force, consisting of Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, announced new agency partnerships to promote job growth in the green economy. The Department of Labor and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are partnering to provide training and employment opportunities to public housing residents. The Secretaries of Energy, Education, and Labor are collaborating to connect private sector jobs created by federal action to training programs and career pathways. The Department of Labor also announced plans to release $500 million in grants from the Recovery Act for training workers in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors. These partnerships aim to connect workers to green career pathways, advance training and education programs, and provide a qualified workforce for the green economy.
