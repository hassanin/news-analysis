The article discusses Executive Order 13592, which aims to improve educational opportunities for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students and strengthen Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs). The order acknowledges the unique political and legal relationship between the US government and AI/AN tribes and the trust responsibility to protect their rights and well-being. The order states that recent studies show alarming dropout rates among AI/AN students and little progress in closing the achievement gap. The policy of the administration is to support activities that expand educational opportunities and improve outcomes for AI/AN students, including learning their native languages and histories. The order also emphasizes the importance of improving educational opportunities for students attending TCUs, which play a vital role in preserving Native languages and cultural traditions. The order establishes the White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native Education, to be co-chaired by the Secretaries of Education and the Interior. The initiative's mission includes working with other agencies, coordinating federal partnerships, and developing a national network to share best practices. The order also establishes an Interagency Working Group and requires federal agencies to develop and implement plans to fulfill the order's objectives. The article concludes by stating that the heads of agencies must provide necessary information to the initiative, and the order does not create any legal rights or benefits.
