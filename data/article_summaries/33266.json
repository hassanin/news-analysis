China's ban on U.S. beef imports has been lifted after 14 years, allowing U.S. cattle producers to access the Chinese market. This is expected to benefit Montana's cattle industry, which is worth $1.78 billion. Montana ranchers, who mostly operate cow-calf operations, will benefit from wider markets for their beef. The persistence of many individuals, including former Montana Sen. Max Baucus, who was the Ambassador to China from 2014 to earlier this year, has paid off. The state's economy is expected to benefit from this development.
