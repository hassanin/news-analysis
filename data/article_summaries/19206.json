The President expresses deep sadness and condemns the assassination of Shahbaz Bhatti, Pakistan's Minister for Minority Affairs. He offers condolences to Bhatti's family and colleagues. Bhatti fought for universal values such as freedom of speech, religious freedom, and equality. Despite death threats, he defended equal rights and challenged Pakistan's blasphemy laws. The President calls for the perpetrators to be brought to justice and for those who share Bhatti's vision to live without fear. The United States will continue to support those dedicated to tolerance and dignity for all.
