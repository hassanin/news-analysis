The White House Easter Egg Roll will be held on April 13, 2009, and tickets will be distributed online for the first time. This change aims to provide more children and families from across the United States with the opportunity to attend the event. The theme for this year is "Let's go play", which encourages youth to lead healthy and active lives. The event will feature sports, cooking classes, live musical performances, storytelling, and the traditional Easter egg roll. Children aged ten and under, along with their families, are invited to attend. All guests will go through a security screening process. More information and tickets will be available on the official website starting from March 26th. For updates on the Easter Egg Roll and other public events at the White House, people can call the Visitors Office information line. Media details will be released in the coming weeks.
