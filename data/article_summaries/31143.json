According to a report from the American Action Forum, the Trump administration is exceeding its regulatory budget goals by cutting Obama-era regulations and saving money. Federal agencies, particularly Labor and Health and Human Services, are leading the effort to meet the president's order to cut at least two old regulations for every new one issued and reduce regulatory costs. The report states that 12 out of 22 agencies have already met or surpassed their savings target, putting the administration on track to double its overall savings goal.
