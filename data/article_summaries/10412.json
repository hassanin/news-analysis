President Barack Obama has proclaimed March 6 through March 12, 2011, as Save Your Vision Week. This proclamation aims to raise awareness about the importance of routine eye care and encourage Americans to take action to protect their eyesight. The Department of Health and Human Services has identified interventions to prevent blindness and promote eye health, but many Americans do not receive recommended eye exams and screenings. Preventive measures such as wearing UV-protective eyewear and maintaining good eating habits can support healthy vision at any age. The proclamation also highlights the United States Congress' authorization of Save Your Vision Week in 1963. Eye care professionals, teachers, media members, and organizations dedicated to preserving eyesight are invited to participate in activities that promote eye and vision health during this week.
