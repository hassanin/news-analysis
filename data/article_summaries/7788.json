The President had a virtual meeting with progressive members of Congress to discuss the importance of the Build Back Better Act and the bipartisan infrastructure bill in achieving economic growth for middle-class families. They emphasized the need to invest in families and repeal tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations. The group also highlighted the benefits of the infrastructure bill, such as improved public transit, climate leadership, clean energy, safe drinking water, and addressing pollution that disproportionately affects communities of color. They agreed on the importance of prioritizing key issues in the final legislative package to make a tangible impact on people's lives. The President will host another virtual meeting with moderate House Democrats tomorrow.
