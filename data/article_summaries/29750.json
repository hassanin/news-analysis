The United States trade negotiating team, led by Robert Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin, traveled to Shanghai, China to discuss the trade relationship between the two countries. The Chinese negotiating team, led by Vice Premier Liu He, also included Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan and other officials. The discussions covered topics such as forced technology transfer, intellectual property rights, services, non-tariff barriers, and agriculture. The Chinese side confirmed their commitment to increase purchases of United States agricultural exports. The meetings were productive, and negotiations on a trade deal will continue in Washington, D.C. in early September.
