President Obama has outlined a new Small Business Lending Fund, which will transfer $30 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to support small business lending. The fund will target community and smaller banks that lend the most to small businesses and offer incentives for them to increase lending. The President's proposal aims to create jobs and stimulate the growth of small businesses. The fund will be separate from TARP to encourage participation and will offer capital with incentives to increase small business lending. The Administration also plans to discuss additional ideas with Congress to enhance credit for small businesses through the fund.
