The President has issued a statement regarding the Clean Water Rule, emphasizing the importance of protecting streams and wetlands under the Clean Water Act. The statement mentions that recent court decisions have created uncertainty and a need for clarification. It highlights that one in three Americans currently receives drinking water from streams without clear protection, causing uncertainty and delay for businesses and industries that rely on clean water. The President called on the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to address this issue and protect vital water resources. After extensive public input, the Clean Water Rule has been finalized to restore protection for streams and wetlands, while not impeding farming, ranching, or forestry activities. The rule aims to provide clarity and certainty for businesses and industries, and hold polluters accountable. The statement also mentions the administration's previous commitments to clean water, such as restoring iconic watersheds and preserving rivers for future generations. Overall, the President sees the Clean Water Rule as a step towards protecting the nation's waters.
