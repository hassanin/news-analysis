The article discusses the Affordable Care Act and its impact on young adults and their healthcare coverage. The law allows children to receive tax-free coverage under their parents' health insurance policy until the age of 27, and provides incentives for employers to extend medical insurance coverage to individuals under the age of 27. The Internal Revenue Service has released guidelines for employers, employees, insurance companies, and other interested parties regarding this provision in the new law. Key points of the law include the expansion of coverage for more children, immediate availability of coverage, applicability to various employer and retiree health plans, and the provision that it is not a burden for employers. The announcement follows measures taken by the Obama administration to quickly extend healthcare coverage to young adults. Several insurance companies have agreed to maintain coverage for young adults enrolled in their parents' plans.
