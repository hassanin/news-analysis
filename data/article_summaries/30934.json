President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring December 7th as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. The proclamation honors those who perished in the attack on Pearl Harbor 77 years ago and salutes all veterans who served in World War II. The attack, carried out by the air and naval forces of Imperial Japan, resulted in the deaths of over 2,400 American service members and wounded another 1,100 citizens. Despite the surprise attack, American service members and first responders mounted a brave defense against insurmountable odds. President Roosevelt's declaration that the American people will win through to absolute victory resonated with the nation, and millions of brave men and women answered the call to service. The proclamation highlights the incredible heroes of World War II and their dedication to defending freedom. President Trump encourages all Americans to observe this solemn day and honor the military, past and present, with appropriate ceremonies and activities. The flag of the United States is urged to be flown at half-staff in honor of those who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.
