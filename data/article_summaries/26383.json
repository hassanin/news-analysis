The President has declared a major disaster in the state of Louisiana and has ordered federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, and straight-line winds hit on February 7, 2017. This declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in the parishes of Livingston and Orleans. The assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Damage surveys are ongoing in other areas, and additional parishes and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are complete. Residents and business owners who suffered losses in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free numbers will be available seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time.
