President Biden has signed an Executive Order to ban the import of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal to the United States. This action has widespread bipartisan support and aims to deprive President Putin of economic resources used to continue the war in Ukraine. The decision was made in consultation with allies, recognizing that not all of them can join the ban. The United States and its allies have imposed economic costs on Russia through sanctions, making it a global economic and financial pariah. The Russian ruble has significantly depreciated, and export controls are impacting key sectors of the Russian economy. The Executive Order aims to mitigate the impact of Putin's war on energy prices and reduce dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels.
