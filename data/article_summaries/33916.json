On November 14, 1979, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency with respect to Iran due to the threat it posed to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The emergency was declared pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Since then, relations with Iran have not normalized, and the process of implementing agreements with Iran is still ongoing. Therefore, Trump has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This renewal is separate from the emergency declared in 1995 and renewed in 2020. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
