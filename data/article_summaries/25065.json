According to a poll conducted by SurveyMonkey and published in the New York Times, more Americans now support the GOP tax reform than oppose it. The poll shows that 51 percent of Americans approve of the new law, while 46 percent remain opposed. This marks a significant increase in support since its passage in December, when only 26 percent of Americans approved of the bill.
