President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in Puerto Rico and ordered federal assistance to aid in the recovery efforts from Tropical Storm Isaias. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in the municipalities of Aguada, Hormigueros, Mayaguez, and Rincon. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to support individuals and business owners in recovering from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures throughout the Commonwealth. Alexis Amparo has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated municipalities can apply for assistance online or by phone.
