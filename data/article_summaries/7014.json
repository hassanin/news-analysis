Today, senior White House officials, including Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Stefanie Feldman, and Rosie Hidalgo, convened a meeting with state legislative leaders to discuss Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) laws. ERPO laws, also known as "red flag" laws, allow concerned individuals to petition for a court order temporarily restricting access to firearms for individuals who pose a danger to themselves or others. This meeting follows previous discussions on ERPO legislation hosted by the White House and a meeting with Attorneys General. Last year, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law, which includes $750 million in funding for states to implement crisis interventions like ERPOs. The Department of Justice recently announced an investment of over $231 million to support the creation and implementation of ERPO programs in various states. Currently, 19 states have ERPO laws in place, and others, such as Michigan and Minnesota, are considering similar legislation. During the meeting, legislative leaders emphasized the importance of ERPO legislation for community safety and discussed best practices for implementation. The White House officials expressed gratitude for their leadership and reiterated the Administration's commitment to supporting the passage and implementation of ERPO laws.
