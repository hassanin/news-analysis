President Obama released a statement in honor of the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, affirming the dignity and worth of all people regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. He highlighted the commitment of the United States to treating all people fairly and with respect, both domestically and internationally. The Obama administration has made the advancement of LGBT rights a focus of their engagement with other countries. While progress has been made, there is still work to be done in combating homophobia and transphobia. LGBT individuals in many places face persecution, discrimination, and violence, and it is the responsibility of all nations and communities to do better. The United States will continue to support human rights champions and citizens around the world who strive for LGBT rights as human rights.
