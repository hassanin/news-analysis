Vice President Harris recently convened environmental leaders from various organizations to discuss the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to combat the climate crisis. The meeting included discussions with other White House officials, such as Ali Zaidi, John Podesta, Mitch Landrieu, and Brenda Mallory. The Vice President emphasized the importance of maintaining momentum after two years of historic legislation and highlighted the need to implement these laws effectively. President Biden previously signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included the largest investment in combating the climate crisis, totaling $370 billion. This investment, along with provisions from other acts and executive actions, aims to transition the nation into a clean energy economy, creating millions of jobs and advancing environmental justice. Vice President Harris emphasized the importance of including and benefiting all Americans in this new clean energy economy. She will further discuss these investments and future work in a moderated conversation in Michigan.
