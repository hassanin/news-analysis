President Obama received a briefing on Tropical Storm Isaac, which could become a hurricane. He was updated on the projected track and timing of the storm and steps being taken by the Administration to support potentially impacted states. The President directed FEMA to coordinate closely with state and local officials and address the needs of local communities. FEMA has already deployed teams to Florida and Louisiana and is in communication with other potentially impacted states. The National Hurricane Center has issued a Hurricane Warning for portions of Florida and a Hurricane Watch for coastal areas of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. After the briefing, the President spoke with Florida Governor Rick Scott to assure him that resources would be made available to support the state as it prepares for and responds to the storm. The President also offered additional resources for the Republican National Convention's safety efforts.
