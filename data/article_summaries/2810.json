Five years after the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the U.S. Justice Department is taking steps to implement the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This law aims to improve gun safety by funding crisis intervention projects in 49 states and territories. The funding, totaling over $231 million, will be used for programs such as "red flag" initiatives, mental health and substance use treatment courts, and veterans' treatment courts. "Red flag" laws allow family members, healthcare providers, school officials, and law enforcement officers to seek court orders preventing individuals deemed dangerous from accessing firearms temporarily. The funding will also support public education and training for law enforcement and officials on extreme risk protection orders. While this announcement is seen as progress, more work is needed, including the enactment of common-sense gun law reforms such as universal background checks, bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers who knowingly distribute weapons of war.
