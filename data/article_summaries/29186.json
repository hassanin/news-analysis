In response to a New York Times editorial about the Congressional Budget Office's score of the American Health Care Act, Health and Human Services Secretary Thomas E. Price wrote a letter to the editor expressing his disagreement. Price argues that the CBO's assessment, which states that 14 million Americans will drop their insurance next year, is simply unbelievable and should not be taken as fact. He also criticizes the editorial for not mentioning the other reforms in progress to provide affordable and quality healthcare to all Americans.
