President Donald J. Trump praises Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden for their efforts to reduce prescription drug costs. He commends their bipartisan legislation, which includes a provision to limit monthly out-of-pocket spending for seniors with chronic high costs. President Trump claims that no previous President has done more to lower prescription drug costs. The White House urges Congress to pass bipartisan drug pricing reform and send it to the President's desk this year to provide relief for American families.
