During the daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, discussed the meeting between President Obama and Pope Francis. The meeting lasted about 40 minutes and was a one-on-one conversation between the two leaders. Earnest did not provide any detailed information about their private discussion, as it was intended to be confidential. However, he did mention that the President enjoyed the opportunity to show the Pope around the White House and introduce him to senior members of his staff. Earnest also commented on the Pope's remarks about climate change, stating that the President welcomed the Pope's kind words about his work on this issue. He emphasized that the goal of the Pope's visit was not to advance any political agenda, but rather to speak with a passion and conviction about the need to act on climate change that was deeply rooted in his faith. Earnest acknowledged that time will tell what impact the Pope's comments will have on the climate change debate and on the next steps taken by the White House. He also briefly addressed Hillary Clinton's opposition to the Keystone pipeline, stating that the State Department is still considering the project and that Clinton's comments were not surprising.
