President Joe Biden has issued an executive order to impose additional sanctions on Russia. The order prohibits the importation of various products from Russia, including fish, seafood, alcoholic beverages, and non-industrial diamonds. It also restricts the exportation of luxury goods and other items to individuals in Russia. Additionally, new investment in certain sectors of the Russian economy is prohibited, as well as the exportation of U.S. dollar-denominated banknotes to the Russian government or individuals in Russia. The order also prohibits any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee of a transaction by a U.S. person that would be prohibited by the order. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce are authorized to take necessary actions to implement the order, and all relevant U.S. departments and agencies are required to comply. The order does not affect transactions for the official business of the U.S. government or the United Nations.
