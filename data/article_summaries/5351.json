President Joe Biden has issued an executive order to revoke several actions implemented by previous administrations. These include Executive Order 13772, which outlined core principles for regulating the US financial system, Executive Order 13828, aimed at reducing poverty by promoting opportunity and economic mobility, and Executive Order 13924, which provided regulatory relief to support economic recovery. The order also revokes other memoranda and executive orders related to labor-management relations, funding to state and local government recipients, federal civic architecture, and democratic accountability in agency rulemaking. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, as well as executive department heads, are directed to consider rescinding any policies or regulations related to these actions. The order does not affect the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is subject to applicable law and available appropriations and does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits. The order was signed on February 24, 2021.
