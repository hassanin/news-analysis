The National Security Council held a teleconference to discuss the upcoming presidential and legislative elections in Taiwan. The United States expressed full confidence in Taiwan's democratic processes and emphasized its opposition to any outside interference or influence in the elections. The United States does not take sides in the elections and will maintain its policy towards Taiwan regardless of the outcome. The United States also reiterated its commitment to the One China policy and the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait differences. The call also discussed the possibility of sending an unofficial delegation to Taiwan after the elections to reinforce support for Taiwan's democratic processes and peace and stability in the region. The United States is closely monitoring any interference or coercion from Beijing and is prepared for potential reactions, but it does not view the Taiwan elections as a determinant of the overall U.S.-China relationship.
