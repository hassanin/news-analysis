On May 22, 2003, President Trump declared a national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq. This was done through Executive Order 13303, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The national emergency was declared to deal with the threats posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq.

The President states that the obstacles to the reconstruction, peace, security, and development in Iraq continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303, as modified and relied upon in subsequent executive orders, must continue beyond May 22, 2017.

In accordance with the National Emergencies Act, the President is continuing the national emergency for 1 year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
