The White House has launched the "My Brother's Keeper Community Challenge" as part of the My Brother's Keeper (MBK) initiative, which aims to improve the life outcomes of all youth, including boys and young men of color. The challenge calls on communities to implement a comprehensive strategy to ensure that all young people can achieve their full potential. The goals of the challenge include ensuring that all children are prepared for school, read at grade level by third grade, graduate from high school, complete post-secondary education or training, are employed, and are safe from violent crime. The challenge also emphasizes the importance of mentoring and the involvement of caring adults in the lives of children. Over 100 mayors, county officials, and tribal nations have accepted the challenge. The challenge is not a new federal program, but rather a call to action for local leaders to develop and execute strategies to improve outcomes for youth in their communities. The National Convening Council (NCC) will provide resources to support the local planning process and assist communities in tracking their progress. The federal government has also announced several programs that address the recommendations of the My Brother's Keeper Task Force progress report, including initiatives to improve the relationship between law enforcement and communities, grants to improve school climates and student safety, and collaborations to expunge and seal juvenile records.
