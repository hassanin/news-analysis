Vice President Joe Biden issued a statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day, expressing the importance of honoring the memories of those who died in the Holocaust and paying tribute to the survivors. He emphasized the need to teach children about the Holocaust to ensure that the memory of these terrible events is never forgotten. Biden shared that he had taken his granddaughter to Dachau, as he had done with his own children, to help young people understand what happened and feel a personal duty to prevent such atrocities from happening again. He called for action to actively fight against bigotry and anti-Semitism wherever it occurs, and praised the survivors for their contributions to society, noting that many are still in need of care and support.
