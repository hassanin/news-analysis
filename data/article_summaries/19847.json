The White House is pleased that the Claims Settlement Act of 2010 has been passed by the House of Representatives, following the Senate's lead. This legislation will provide funding for settlements in the Pigford II lawsuit, brought by African American farmers, and the Cobell lawsuit, brought by Native Americans over the management of Indian trust accounts and resources. The President thanks Attorney General Holder, and Secretaries Salazar and Vilsack for their work in reaching this outcome and applauds Congress for bipartisan action. The bill also includes funding for settlements in four separate water rights suits brought by Native American tribes, addressing the water needs of Indian Country. The President acknowledges that more work needs to be done, particularly in resolving claims of past discrimination made by women, Hispanic farmers, and others.
