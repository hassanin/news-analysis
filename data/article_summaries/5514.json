The Biden-Harris Administration has released its first annual progress report on the America the Beautiful initiative, which aims to conserve 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. The report highlights the steps taken by federal agencies to support local conservation efforts and outlines six areas of focus, including creating parks and safe outdoor opportunities, supporting Tribally-led conservation, and increasing access for outdoor recreation. The report also reviews the restoration of protections for natural and cultural resources, the incorporation of Indigenous knowledge into decision-making, and the inclusive approach to stewardship. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides a significant boost to the initiative by investing in the resilience of physical and natural systems. Additionally, the Administration is taking steps to ensure that the initiative aligns with the priorities and needs of local communities, Tribes, states, and other stakeholders. Many states, Tribes, and private sector leaders have expressed support for the national conservation goal and have advanced their own efforts to conserve and restore lands and waters.
