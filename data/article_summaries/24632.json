The White House Press Secretary released a statement on June 15, 2010, expressing gratitude for the House of Representatives' decision to cut taxes for small businesses and encourage their growth and hiring. The President's main economic priority is getting the American people back to work, and small businesses play a crucial role in job creation. The President has been advocating for new investments in small businesses and has signed the HIRE Act into law, which extends tax credits for businesses that hire the unemployed. The bill passed also includes the President's proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on small business investments. These tax cuts are part of a larger small business jobs package, which includes the President's Small Business Lending Fund and State Small Business Credit Initiative. The House is scheduled to vote on this package this week. However, the President urges Congress to continue fighting for other job creation measures and providing relief to states and the unemployed. Congress will also vote on a package of state and unemployment relief being considered by the Senate. The President hopes that Congress will continue to support the American people during these challenging economic times.
