Today, President Obama will sign the Claims Resolution Act of 2010, which includes funding for the Pigford II settlement with the USDA ($1.15 billion) and the Cobell settlement with the Department of the Interior ($3.4 billion). It also settles four Indian water rights disputes for seven Indian tribes in Arizona, Montana, and New Mexico. Additionally, the act provides a one-year extension of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grants, a six-month extension of the supplemental TANF grant program, and provisions to improve the integrity of the unemployment compensation program. The signing ceremony will be attended by various administration officials, members of Congress, key leaders and advocates from African American and Native American communities, as well as tribal leaders and farmers.
