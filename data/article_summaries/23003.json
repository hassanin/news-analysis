The United States is providing additional humanitarian assistance to Lebanon to support the nearly 800,000 Syrian refugees who have fled violence in Syria. President Obama announced that the U.S. will contribute nearly $340 million, bringing the total U.S. contribution to nearly $1.4 billion since the beginning of the crisis. Of this, more than $74 million will be used to support humanitarian efforts in Lebanon, including providing rent support, essential household items, food vouchers, and healthcare services. The U.S. is also funding development assistance programs in Lebanon, including improving education, water infrastructure, governance, and economic opportunities. The U.S. supports UN agencies and NGOs in providing a range of assistance to refugees and host communities, including medical services, food, shelter, and education for Syrian and Palestinian refugees. The U.S. also supports programs that address the health and protection needs of refugees, as well as counseling and support for those struggling to overcome the violence they have witnessed. Additionally, U.S. development assistance focuses on rehabilitating public schools, improving access to clean drinking water, and reducing volatility in vulnerable communities.
