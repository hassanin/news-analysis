The number of Americans filing applications for new unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in half a century, indicating a tight labor market. Initial jobless claims decreased by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 202,000 in the week ended March 30, the lowest level since December 1969. Economists had expected 218,000 new claims. The four-week moving average of claims, a steadier measure, also fell by 4,000 to 213,500. This suggests that the labor market remains strong, resulting in some of the fastest wage growth in the current business cycle.
