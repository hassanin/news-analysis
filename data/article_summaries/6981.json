The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new actions to promote fairness in the rental market and improve the quality of life for renters. They have released a Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights, which outlines principles to strengthen tenant protections and rental affordability. The administration is taking several key actions in line with the Blueprint, including strengthening fair housing enforcement, expanding access to legal aid for renters, and promoting rental assistance programs. They are also launching the Resident-Centered Housing Challenge, calling on housing providers and stakeholders to make commitments that enhance the quality of life for renters. The challenge encourages states and local governments to develop policies that promote fairness and transparency in the rental market. Over 15 million rental units have already made commitments to the challenge. The administration welcomes additional commitments from interested stakeholders. The goal is to reduce eviction rates, eliminate hidden fees, expand eviction prevention measures, and improve communication about tenant rights. The administration acknowledges that rental housing has become less affordable, disproportionately affecting Black women and their children. They have taken steps to promote fairness in the rental market, such as keeping the national eviction moratorium in place until August 2021 and providing rental and utility assistance through Emergency Rental Assistance programs. The administration is also focused on closing America's housing supply shortfall and providing housing vouchers to all eligible households. They have proposed expanding rental assistance to an additional 200,000 households and have secured rental assistance for over 100,000 households. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has also published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on efforts to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing.
