The leaders of Japan and the United States have issued a joint statement pledging to remove and dispose of all highly-enriched uranium (HEU) and separated plutonium from the Fast Critical Assembly (FCA) at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency. This effort aims to minimize stocks of HEU and plutonium worldwide to prevent unauthorized actors, criminals, or terrorists from acquiring such materials. The materials will be securely transported to the United States, where they will be converted into less sensitive forms. The HEU will be downblended to low enriched uranium (LEU) for civilian use, while the plutonium will be prepared for final disposition. Both countries also plan to work together to enhance the FCA's research on nuclear waste transmutation and disposition. The United States will continue to accept research reactor spent fuel from Japanese facilities that utilize LEU. The joint statement emphasizes the importance of minimizing stocks of nuclear material and encourages other countries to consider similar actions.
