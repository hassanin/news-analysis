Governor Mark Parkinson is supporting President Obama's tax-package compromise with Congress, which includes extending unemployment insurance, tax cuts for working families, and business incentives. Parkinson believes that this tax package will provide assistance to unemployed Kansans and relief for middle-class families. He commends President Obama for working across party lines to find solutions for the country's economic recovery. The governor encourages Congress to approve the framework quickly, which includes benefits such as an extension of unemployment benefits, middle-class tax cuts, a payroll tax cut for working people, an extension of the earned income tax credit, and tax incentives for business expansion.
