The article discusses the extension of a safeguard measure imposed on imports of certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells by the President of the United States. The safeguard measure includes a tariff-rate quota on imports of CSPV cells and an increase in duties on imports exceeding the quota. The President also revoked the exclusion of bifacial solar panels from the safeguard measure in a previous proclamation but was later challenged in court. The court ruled that the President acted outside of his authority and reinstated the exclusion of bifacial modules. The US International Trade Commission (USITC) issued reports on the impact of the safeguard measure and recommended increasing the tariff-rate quota to continue growth in solar module production. The USITC also found that the domestic industry was making positive adjustments to import competition. The President considered the USITC reports and determined that the safeguard measure should be extended for an additional four years. The measure includes the continuation of the tariff-rate quota and the increase in duties on imports of CSPV modules, with an exclusion for bifacial panels. The President also instructed the US Trade Representative to enter into negotiations with Canada and Mexico and authorized revisions to the list of excluded countries. The USITC will continue monitoring the domestic industry's progress and will report back to the President.
