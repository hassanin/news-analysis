On the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation to remember the 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust and pay tribute to the American soldiers and Allied Forces who fought against the Nazis. The proclamation also reaffirms the commitment to fight against anti-Semitism and the importance of never forgetting the Holocaust. It highlights the systematic plan of the Nazis to exterminate the Jewish people and others they deemed undesirable, and the unimaginable cruelty and barbarity that occurred during that time. The proclamation emphasizes the duty to ensure that each new generation knows the truth and that the lessons of the Holocaust are engrained in humanity's consciousness. It also recognizes the resilience of the Jewish people who founded the State of Israel in defiance of the Holocaust and sends a message to those who seek the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people: "Never Again." The proclamation designates January 27, 2020, as a National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz, calling upon all Americans to observe the day with programs, ceremonies, prayers, and commemorations to honor the memory of the Holocaust victims and acknowledge the sacrifices of those who helped liberate them.
