President Obama addressed the United Nations General Assembly and called for global cooperation in preventing, detecting, and fighting all kinds of biological dangers, including pandemics, terrorist threats, and treatable diseases. The United States is taking a multi-faceted approach to address infectious diseases, whether naturally occurring, accidental, or intentional. This includes collaborating with international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) to ensure disease no longer threatens the security and prosperity of nations. The United States is committed to assisting countries in developing capacities to detect, report, and respond to infectious diseases, in line with the WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR). The United States has signed an agreement with the WHO on "Global Health Security" to strengthen cooperation on shared health security priorities. The Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the development and stockpiling of biological weapons, offers an opportunity to counter biological proliferation and bioterrorism through multinational coordination. President Obama's Global Health Initiative partners with countries to improve health outcomes, including maternal and child health, family planning, nutrition, and infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases. Strengthening health systems is a key principle of the initiative.
