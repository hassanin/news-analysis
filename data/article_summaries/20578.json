The article discusses the launch of negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) agreement between the United States and the European Union (EU). The T-TIP aims to boost economic growth, promote international competitiveness, and create jobs. It plans to open EU markets, strengthen investment rules, eliminate tariffs, address non-tariff barriers, improve market access for services, reduce regulatory differences, and promote cooperation on global issues. It also aims to support small- and medium-sized enterprises. The first round of negotiations will take place in Washington, D.C. in July.
