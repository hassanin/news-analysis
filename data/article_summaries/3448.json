On the 56th anniversary of the peaceful protest in Selma, Alabama, where state troopers violently attacked protestors advocating for voting rights, President Biden will sign an Executive Order to promote voting access and ensure all eligible Americans can participate in the democratic process. The order aims to expand access to voter registration services and information, improve federal websites and digital services that provide election information, assist states in voter registration efforts, modernize Vote.gov, increase federal employees' access to voting, analyze barriers to voting for people with disabilities, increase voting access for military and overseas voters, provide voting access and education to citizens in federal custody, and establish a Native American voting rights steering group. This Executive Order is an initial step in the administration's efforts to protect the right to vote and advocate for reforms to make voting more equitable and accessible for all Americans.
