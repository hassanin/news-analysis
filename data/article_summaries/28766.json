President Trump announced the launch of Operation Warp Speed, a historic initiative aimed at rapidly developing and manufacturing a coronavirus vaccine. The objective of Operation Warp Speed is to finish developing, manufacturing, and distributing a proven vaccine as quickly as possible. The government will invest in manufacturing all of the top vaccine candidates before they are approved to eliminate any unnecessary delays. The goal is to have a vaccine available to the public by the end of the year or sooner. The President also emphasized the importance of therapeutics and other treatments in addition to vaccines. He expressed confidence in the progress being made and the collaboration with other countries in finding a solution to the pandemic.
