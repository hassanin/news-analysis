The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a briefing by OMB Director Peter Orszag and Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Christina Romer. The briefing discussed the fiscal year 2011 budget, which focuses on job creation, middle-class security, and fiscal sustainability. The budget includes investments in job creation, such as the jobs and wages tax credit, as well as investments in education, innovation, and clean energy. The budget also addresses the medium-term deficit by proposing specific steps to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion over the next decade. It includes measures such as a financial services fee, allowing the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for those with incomes above $250,000, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, and implementing a three-year freeze on non-security discretionary spending. The briefing also highlighted the need for comprehensive health reform to address the long-term fiscal gap driven primarily by healthcare costs. The briefing emphasized the importance of a bipartisan fiscal commission to address the long-term fiscal imbalance and produce plans to balance the budget by 2015.
