The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) recently held its second ministerial meeting in France to strengthen economic partnership and update the rules of the global economy. The meeting was attended by high-level officials from both sides, including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis. The United States and the European Union have resolved long-standing issues and worked together to counter non-market trade practices. The TTC working groups are focused on expanding digital tools for small and medium-sized enterprises, securing critical supply chains, collaborating on emerging technology standards, addressing climate and clean tech objectives, and countering the misuse of technology. The working groups are engaging with various stakeholders, including industry, labor organizations, think tanks, and civil society, to inform their work.
