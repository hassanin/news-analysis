The memorandum is addressed to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, and it discusses the reinstatement of Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Liberians. It provides a background on the granting of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Liberians who fled their country due to armed conflict and civil strife. The armed conflict ended in 2003, and TPS for Liberian nationals ended in 2007. However, subsequent presidents extended the grant of DED for Liberians until March 2020. In December 2019, the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness (LRIF) provision was enacted, allowing eligible Liberians to apply for adjustment of status to become lawful permanent residents (LPR). The LRIF application process faced challenges, resulting in a one-year extension to the application period. The memorandum states that there are foreign policy reasons to reinstate DED for Liberians currently residing in the United States who were under a grant of DED as of January 10, 2021. It urges Liberian DED beneficiaries to apply promptly for adjustment of status and directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to review the LRIF application procedures. The memorandum determines that the removal of any Liberian national who was under a grant of DED as of January 10, 2021, should be deferred until June 30, 2022, and employment authorization should continue until that date. Certain categories of individuals are excluded from the grant of DED. The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to implement the deferral of enforced departure and authorization for employment.
