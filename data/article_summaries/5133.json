Operation Allies Welcome, a whole-of-America effort to evacuate and resettle Afghans in the United States, has welcomed nearly 43,000 Afghans to 46 states since August. These individuals include translators, Afghan veterans, humanitarian workers, journalists, women's rights activists, and others who supported peace, security, and justice in Afghanistan alongside the U.S. mission. The outpouring of support from various groups, including veterans, faith-based organizations, businesses, and the refugee community, has been inspiring. The Welcome.US website offers ways to support Afghan allies and ensure they receive a warm and dignified welcome. Americans across the country are embracing the opportunity to welcome their new Afghan neighbors. The authors express gratitude to those who have shown generosity and hope others will join in offering a warm welcome to the United States.
