The President has reviewed a report from the Treasury Department watchdog regarding the IRS targeting conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status. The President finds the report's findings to be intolerable and inexcusable. He believes that the federal government, especially the IRS, must conduct itself in a way that earns the public's trust. The President has directed Secretary Lew to hold those responsible accountable and to implement the Inspector General's recommendations quickly to prevent such misconduct in the future. The President expects all federal government employees to uphold the highest ethical and moral standards, and he intends to ensure that public servants live up to those standards every day.
