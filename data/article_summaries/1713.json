President Biden will be signing a proclamation to establish the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument on what would have been Emmett Till's 82nd birthday. The monument will be located in Mississippi and Illinois and will highlight the events surrounding Emmett Till's murder, the civil rights movement, and the broader story of Black oppression and bravery in America. The monument will be anchored at three historic sites in Chicago, Sumner, and Glendora, which played a significant role in Emmett Till's murder and the subsequent events. The national monument aims to encourage partnerships between the Department of the Interior, the National Park Service, and local communities to conserve and interpret a network of historic sites related to Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley. The lynching of Emmett Till gained nationwide coverage and helped catalyze the civil rights movement. This designation is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to advancing civil rights and racial justice. The monument will be managed by the National Park Service and will consist of 5.70 acres across the three sites. These sites will showcase the life and murder of Emmett Till, the unjust acquittal of his murderers, and the activism of Mamie Till-Mobley. The proclamation also directs the National Park Service to develop a plan to preserve and interpret other key sites related to Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley. The designation honors the efforts of the Till family, civil rights leaders, and elected officials to protect these sites and ensure that Emmett Till's story continues to be told.
