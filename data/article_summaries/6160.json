President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Illinois due to severe storms and flooding that occurred from June 29 to July 2, 2023. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Cook County residents are eligible for federal funding, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Hazard mitigation measures in Cook County will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Andrew D. Friend from FEMA has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing in other areas, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated based on the completed assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance through various channels, including the DisasterAssistance.gov website, calling FEMA, or using the FEMA App. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
