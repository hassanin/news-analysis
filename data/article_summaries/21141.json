The Obama Administration has implemented the first parts of the new export control system as part of the President's Export Control Reform Initiative (ECR). The revisions to the U.S. Munitions List (USML) and the Commerce Control List (CCL) that went into effect today focus on controls for aircraft and gas turbine engines. These changes aim to address the challenges posed by an outdated export control system created during the Cold War. The previous system did not prioritize controls between end-items and their parts, resulting in a disproportionate focus on less sensitive items. The new controls aim to address these issues while considering national security and foreign policy interests. The revised control lists are more detailed and impose controls based on the sensitivity of the item and the destination. The most sensitive items remain on the USML, while less sensitive items are subject to the authorities of the CCL. The new system also introduces new licensing policies, with USML-controlled items subject to stringent controls and requirements, and less sensitive items on the CCL having fewer requirements. Many of the items on the CCL are now eligible for export without specific licenses if intended for the ultimate end-use by U.S. allies and partners, which helps resolve interoperability issues. The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigations will continue to enforce export controls, with enhanced oversight for items on the CCL. The IT infrastructure for export licensing has also been improved, with the Department of State transferring its export licensing database to the Department of Defense's system. These changes are the result of extensive collaboration among the Administration, Congress, NGOs, and private industry. Additional control list changes will be implemented in the future to address national security and foreign policy challenges.
