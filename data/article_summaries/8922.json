In a press call, a senior administration official announced that President Biden has decided to draw down the remaining U.S. troops from Afghanistan and end the 20-year war. The orderly drawdown will begin before May 1st and all U.S. troops will be out of the country before the 20th anniversary of 9/11. The decision was made after a rigorous policy review, and the President believes that the threat to the homeland from Afghanistan can be addressed without a persistent military presence. The focus will now shift to supporting the ongoing peace process diplomatically. The drawdown will be coordinated with NATO Allies and partners, and the Taliban has been warned that any attacks on U.S. troops during the withdrawal will be met with a forceful response. The U.S. will also remain engaged with the government of Afghanistan and work to protect the gains made by Afghan women. Counterterrorism capabilities will be repositioned to monitor and disrupt terrorist threats from Afghanistan and other countries. The President believes that in contending with the threats and challenges of 2021, the U.S. needs to focus on competition with China, the current pandemic, and the more distributed terrorist threat across multiple countries. The withdrawal is not conditions-based and the U.S. is committed to completing it before September 11th, although it could be completed well in advance of that date. The remaining military presence will be focused on protecting the diplomatic presence in Afghanistan. The U.S. will use its diplomatic, humanitarian, and economic tools to protect the gains made by women and girls, and will make it clear to any government that wants international legitimacy that they must not interfere with human rights progress in Afghanistan. The repositioning of American troops and the security measures for the embassy are still being determined.
