President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance in Alaska following a severe storm, flooding, and landslides that occurred between September 15 and September 20, 2022. The federal funding, which was originally set at 75% of the total eligible costs, has now been increased to 100% for the first 30 days of the incident period. The funding is available for emergency protective measures, public assistance, hazard mitigation, and other needs assistance.
