President Trump's budget proposal is expected to significantly reduce the size and role of the federal government. It aims to prioritize the military and homeland security while cutting funding for various programs including housing, foreign assistance, environmental programs, public broadcasting, and research. The budget proposes an increase in military spending, funds to start building a wall along the US-Mexico border, and initiatives to expand access to charter schools and other educational programs. Trump and his advisers believe that the federal workforce is too large and that the government spends too much money. They argue that federal spending crowds the private sector and burdens companies with regulations and bureaucracy. The budget proposal does not touch spending on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, poverty assistance, and interest payments on government debt. The proposal comes at a time when the federal budget is facing challenges due to the increasing number of Americans collecting benefits and growing national debt. The administration aims to change the way Washington thinks and believes that problems cannot be solved simply by throwing money at them.
