On September 21, 2012, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation to establish the Chimney Rock National Monument in southwestern Colorado. The site holds significant spiritual, historic, and scientific resources, including the remains of the ancient Chaco civilization. The landscape is home to the Chimney Rock and Companion Rock formations, which were used by the Ancestral Pueblo People to build stone buildings and conduct astronomical observations. The area is also rich in archaeological, geological, and biological features, supporting a diverse range of wildlife. The establishment of the monument aims to protect and preserve these resources for future generations. The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Forest Service, will manage the monument and develop a management plan to ensure the proper care and access to the objects of interest. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of consulting with tribal communities and respecting their cultural traditions and rights within the monument.
