In this proclamation, President Barack Obama declares July 28, 2015, as World Hepatitis Day. The proclamation raises awareness about the global epidemic of viral hepatitis, which affects nearly 400 million people worldwide and causes over 1 million deaths each year. The silent nature of hepatitis often means that people are unaware of their infection status until it has caused long-term liver damage or death. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of prevention and early detection through vaccines and blood tests. President Obama highlights the Affordable Care Act, which has increased access to healthcare and requires insurance plans to cover preventive services for hepatitis. The administration is also working with various organizations to prevent new cases of viral hepatitis and address related health issues. The proclamation calls for a renewed commitment to those impacted by hepatitis and urges citizens to join in activities that increase awareness and prevention efforts.
