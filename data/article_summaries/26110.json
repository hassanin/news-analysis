The U.S. economy added 261,000 jobs in October, bringing the unemployment rate down to 4.1 percent, the lowest rate in over 16 years. Job growth estimates for August and September were also revised upward, putting the U.S. back on track with the 2017 job growth trend. The strong October numbers were a rebound from the effects of Hurricane Irma in September, which caused many workers in weather-sensitive industries to be temporarily removed from payrolls. The unemployment rate for all veterans fell to 2.7 percent, the lowest rate since November 2000. The labor force participation rate and average hourly wages remained relatively stable. Overall, the report indicates that the U.S. economy is experiencing worker-friendly growth and translating real GDP growth into jobs for workers.
