President Obama has launched the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative (YLAI) to provide opportunities for emerging entrepreneurs and civil society activists. The initiative will offer 250 fellowships each year to participants from the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean to develop joint business and civil society initiatives. YLAI aims to foster partnerships between young leaders in these regions and the United States, contributing to the goal of generating $1 billion for emerging business and social entrepreneurs by the end of 2017. The fellowship includes six weeks of training, immersion at an incubator or accelerator, and a summit in Washington, D.C. to facilitate mentoring, networking, and investment opportunities. YLAI will also provide ongoing support and resources for collaboration. Additionally, the United States is investing $68 million in education, training, and employment programs for at-risk youth in Central America and the Caribbean. This includes a new higher education program, partnerships with employers for skills training, and an education project in Guatemala. These initiatives build on existing programs such as the President's 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative, the Small Business Network of the Americas, and the Women Entrepreneurs in the Americas initiative.
