This article discusses the efforts made by the Obama administration to promote computer science education in the United States. It highlights the fact that while there are half a million open technology jobs in the country, computer science education remains largely absent from K-12 schools. The article mentions that only 40 percent of K-12 schools offer a single computer science course, and only 32 states allow students to count computer science towards high school graduation requirements. In response to this, President Obama called for every child to have the opportunity to learn computer science. Throughout 2016, various actions were taken to support this goal, including the expansion of computer science education in 14 new states, the launch of a new AP-CS course, and the coordination of efforts by 15 federal agencies. In addition, numerous organizations have responded to the call to action by making commitments to promote computer science education. The article also mentions specific actions taken by federal agencies and organizations to support computer science education. These actions include investments in research and development, the development of strategic frameworks, and the creation of new programs and resources for teachers and students. The article concludes by highlighting the efforts made during Computer Science Education Week 2016 to engage students and educators in computer science activities.
