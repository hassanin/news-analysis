The President and First Lady are expressing their condolences to the University of Virginia community following a deadly shooting that claimed the lives of three young people. They are also offering their sympathies to the families, friends, and neighbors affected by the tragedy. Administration officials are in contact with state and local authorities, and they appreciate their quick response. Gun violence remains a pressing issue in America, and President Biden has signed significant gun safety legislation this year. However, more needs to be done, including enacting an assault weapons ban. House Democrats have taken action, and the Senate should follow suit.
