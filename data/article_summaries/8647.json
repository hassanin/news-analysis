In a recent press conference, President Biden addressed the current surge in COVID-19 cases caused by the Delta variant. He emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated to prevent severe illness and hospitalization. While breakthrough cases among vaccinated individuals can still occur, they are rare and usually mild. The President urged Americans to follow the new mask recommendations from the CDC in areas with high case rates, even if vaccinated, to protect the unvaccinated and prevent further spread of the virus. He also announced additional measures to encourage vaccination, including paid leave for getting vaccinated, $100 incentives for getting vaccinated, and requirements for federal employees and contractors to disclose their vaccination status. The President expressed the need for more adolescents to get vaccinated and called for schools to open full-time with proper safety measures. He acknowledged the challenges ahead but expressed confidence in the ability of Americans to overcome them by following the science, getting vaccinated, and taking necessary precautions.
