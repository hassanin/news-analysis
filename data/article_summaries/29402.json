The article discusses the necessity of supporting the U.S. manufacturing industry and the importance of imposing tariffs on foreign imports to revive essential steel and aluminum industries. The author argues that unchecked foreign imports would harm the national security of the United States. The article also mentions President Trump's campaign promise to revive American heavy industry and his imposition of tariffs on imported steel and aluminum as a starting point for a long-term policy. The author suggests that these actions are forcing a re-examination of America's trade policies and encouraging other countries to consider the consequences of the trade war they have waged on the U.S. The ultimate goal is to restart U.S. industry and reclaim American jobs.
