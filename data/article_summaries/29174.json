The Trump Administration has prioritized funding for artificial intelligence (AI) research and development (R&D), as well as removing regulatory barriers to the deployment of AI-powered technologies. The administration is also focused on training the American workforce for the 21st century economy and achieving strategic military advantage through AI. Additionally, executive departments and agencies are using AI to improve government services, and the White House OSTP is leading international AI negotiations to promote AI R&D and recognize its potential benefits.
