President Barack Obama has proclaimed May as Older Americans Month to honor and celebrate the contributions of older Americans to society. The theme for this year's celebration is "Older Americans: Connecting the Community," highlighting the importance of seniors in enriching lives and utilizing technology to remain engaged in their communities. The Obama administration is committed to meeting the needs of American seniors by focusing on preventive care and community living. The Affordable Care Act provides seniors with greater freedom and control over their healthcare, including comprehensive prescription drug coverage and access to annual wellness visits and preventive services. Older Americans are also actively involved in community service, supporting the arts, mentoring children, and volunteering at food pantries and libraries. The Corporation for National and Community Service and the Administration on Aging work to connect seniors to community service opportunities. President Obama recognizes the impact and accomplishments of older Americans and encourages all Americans to acknowledge their contributions throughout the year.
