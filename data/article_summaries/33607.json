President Donald J. Trump has announced a partnership with the Ad Council, major media networks, and digital platforms to provide accurate and timely information about COVID-19 to the American people. This partnership aims to benefit high-risk populations and the general public by sharing public service announcements (PSAs) on topics such as social distancing, personal hygiene, and mental health. The PSAs will direct audiences to visit coronavirus.gov, a centralized resource for up-to-date information on the crisis. All PSAs and content will be aired and run during donated air time and space coordinated through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services.
