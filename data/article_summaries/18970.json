Vice President Joe Biden announced that the Obama Administration will allocate $2.3 billion in Recovery Act funds to support health and human services programs for children and disease prevention. $2 billion will be provided to states for child care services, benefiting families who require care while working or seeking employment. The funds can be used for vouchers or contracts with child care centers. The remaining $300 million will be used for vaccines and grants to ensure underserved Americans receive the vaccines they need. These funds will be distributed through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization program. The announcement coincided with National Public Health Week. The Child Care and Development Fund will receive $2 billion to support child care services, and the Section 317 program will receive $300 million for immunization operations and infrastructure. Additional grants will be provided to support innovative approaches to increasing vaccination rates. The funds will also be used to increase public awareness and education about vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases.
