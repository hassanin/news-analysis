President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has revoked Proclamation 9945, which imposed a suspension of entry for immigrants who would financially burden the US healthcare system. The President believes that this suspension does not serve the interests of the United States and is committed to expanding access to quality, affordable healthcare. The revocation is also in line with the policy of restoring faith in the legal immigration system and promoting integration and inclusion efforts for new Americans. The Secretaries of State, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security will review any regulations and issue revised guidance consistent with this proclamation. The proclamation does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, nor does it create any enforceable rights or benefits.
