Whitson also holds the record for the most spacewalks conducted by a female astronaut. The President's call with Whitson will take place on April 24 at 10:00 AM EDT, and it will be aired live on NASA Television and livestreamed on NASA's website and Facebook page. Ivanka Trump and astronaut Kate Rubins will join the call, while astronaut Jack Fischer will be with Whitson at the International Space Station.
