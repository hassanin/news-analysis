On July 24, 2011, President Obama declared a national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations. This declaration was made in order to address the threat these organizations pose to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. These criminal organizations have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous, and they are involved in activities that weaken democratic institutions, degrade the rule of law, and undermine economic markets. They also contribute to violent conflicts and support other dangerous individuals. Given the ongoing threat, President Obama has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This decision will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
