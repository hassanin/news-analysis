On June 26, 2001, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans due to the unusual and extraordinary threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This was done through Executive Order 13219, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The national emergency was declared in response to extremist violence in the former Republic of Macedonia (now the Republic of North Macedonia) and the Western Balkans region, as well as acts obstructing the implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 in Kosovo. The President later amended the order in 2003 to address acts obstructing the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 in Macedonia. The threat posed by extremist violence and obstructionist activities in the Western Balkans region continues to be a concern for the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, President Trump is continuing the national emergency for another year beyond June 26, 2020. This decision will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
