President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 in 2008 regarding North Korea will continue beyond June 26, 2010. The President cites the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula as a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, certain restrictions with respect to North Korea and North Korean nationals will be maintained.
