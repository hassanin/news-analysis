The President met with Dr. Anthony Fauci and the White House COVID Response Team to discuss the Omicron variant. Dr. Fauci informed the President that it will take about two more weeks to gather more information on the variant's transmissibility and severity. However, he believes that existing vaccines can still offer some protection against severe cases of COVID. Dr. Fauci emphasized the importance of booster shots for fully vaccinated individuals as they provide the strongest protection against the virus. The COVID Response Team recommends that all vaccinated adults get a booster shot as soon as possible. Additionally, it is crucial for those who are not fully vaccinated to get vaccinated immediately. The President will provide an update on the new variant and the U.S. response on Monday.
