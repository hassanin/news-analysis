On the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Obama Administration reaffirms its commitment to enforcing and protecting the civil rights of all individuals. The ADA, signed into law on July 26, 1990, aimed to provide equal privileges, pursuits, and opportunities for citizens with disabilities. Despite the progress made, there is still work to be done, particularly in improving employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. To address this, President Obama signed an Executive Order last year to make the federal government a model employer for individuals with disabilities. Additionally, the administration announced new efforts to enhance employment opportunities and increase accessibility within the government. This includes releasing a draft comprehensive strategic plan to improve compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which requires federal agencies' electronic and information technology to be accessible to people with disabilities. By making technology 508 compliant, it ensures equal access for job applicants and promotes increased retention among federal employees. It also aims to make the government more open and accessible by allowing people with disabilities to better access online information.
