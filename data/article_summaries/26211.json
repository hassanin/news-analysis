President Donald J. Trump has signed a space policy directive instructing NASA to pursue manned extraterrestrial exploration. The directive aims to refocus the space program on feasible goals and create incentives for private industry to spur 21st-century space capabilities. The United States is no longer the undisputed leader in human space exploration and should strive to be at the forefront of knowledge and the leader amongst nations in this field.
