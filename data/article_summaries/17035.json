The United States is deeply concerned about the recent violence in Jonglei State, South Sudan, between the Murle and Lou Nuer tribes. The clashes have resulted in significant human suffering, displacement, and death. The US urges all parties to refrain from further provocative or retaliatory acts. The South Sudanese government's launch of an investigation into the attacks and deployment of additional military and police forces to the region is welcomed. The US also supports efforts by the UN and non-governmental organizations to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by the violence. It is important for the South Sudanese government to address the lack of security in these communities and work towards a long-term resolution to the violence. The US calls upon the South Sudanese government and the UN to continue collaborating on conflict prevention and civilian protection. The UN should provide any necessary support to carry out its responsibilities in South Sudan.
