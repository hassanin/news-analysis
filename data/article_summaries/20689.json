The article discusses the steps that the Obama administration is taking to help Americans manage student loan debt. The administration is implementing measures to make college more affordable and to make it easier for students to repay their federal student loans. One of these measures is capping monthly loan payments at 10% of discretionary income, which will reduce payments for more than 1.6 million borrowers. The article also highlights the income-based repayment plan, which caps payments at 15% of discretionary income and allows for loan forgiveness after 10 years of payments for those in public service occupations. The administration is working to make it easier for borrowers to participate in income-based repayment and is providing resources such as the Student Debt Repayment Assistant, an online tool that provides information on repayment options. Another initiative is to encourage borrowers with split loans to consolidate them into the Direct Loan program, which simplifies the repayment process and reduces interest rates. The article also mentions the "Know Before You Owe" project, which aims to create a model financial aid disclosure form to help students understand the type and amount of aid they qualify for and compare aid packages from different institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is seeking feedback on how to improve the form.
