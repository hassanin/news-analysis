This article is a press release from the White House, announcing an executive order signed by President Barack Obama. The executive order is titled "Enhancing Coordination of National Efforts in the Arctic" and its purpose is to prepare the United States for the changing Arctic region and enhance coordination of national efforts in that area. 

The executive order emphasizes the critical value of the Arctic in terms of strategic, ecological, cultural, and economic aspects. It acknowledges the rapid warming of the Alaskan Arctic due to climate change and the resulting consequences such as the reduction of Arctic sea ice, glacier retreat, coastal erosion, and other environmental changes. The United States, as a global leader, has a responsibility to address climate change, protect life and property, and serve as stewards for valuable ecosystems.

To facilitate coordination, the executive order establishes an Arctic Executive Steering Committee, which will provide guidance to executive departments and agencies, as well as enhance coordination of federal Arctic policies across different entities. The committee will consist of various government officials and representatives from different agencies. It will meet regularly to shape priorities, establish strategic direction, oversee implementation, and ensure coordination of federal activities in the Arctic.

The responsibilities of the Arctic Executive Steering Committee include providing guidance on implementing existing Arctic policies, prioritizing federal activities during the United States' Chairmanship of the Arctic Council, and addressing potential overlap and gaps in implementation. The executive order also emphasizes the importance of engagement with the State of Alaska, Alaska Native tribal governments, and other stakeholders to promote collaboration and transparency.

The executive order concludes by stating that it does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also clarifies that the order does not create any rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities.
