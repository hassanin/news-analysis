President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring July 16 through July 22, 2017, as Captive Nations Week. This week is dedicated to standing in solidarity with those living under repressive regimes and promoting American ideals of freedom and respect for natural rights. The proclamation recognizes that while the Soviet Union collapsed over 25 years ago, millions of people still live under authoritarian regimes. It emphasizes the importance of fighting against injustices and abuses inflicted by these regimes and encourages them to embrace a more hopeful and prosperous future. The proclamation also calls upon all Americans to reaffirm their commitment to those around the world striving for liberty, justice, and the rule of law.
