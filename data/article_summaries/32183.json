President Donald Trump has issued a memorandum rejecting S.J. Res. 7, a joint resolution aimed at directing the removal of US armed forces from hostilities in Yemen. Trump argues that the resolution is unnecessary, as the US is not engaged in hostilities in Yemen, except for counterterrorism operations against al-Qa'ida and ISIS. He also states that the resolution is dangerous and infringes on his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. Trump asserts that the US provides limited support to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen to protect American citizens and allies from Houthi attacks and to counter Iran's influence. He emphasizes that the conflict in Yemen requires a negotiated settlement, and criticizes the Senate for not confirming his nominees for key diplomatic positions. Trump concludes by stating that his administration is working to end military engagements in Afghanistan and Syria, and urges Congress to focus on those efforts rather than the resolution on Yemen.
