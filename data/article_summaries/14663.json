The United States is committed to addressing trafficking in persons and irregular migration in East Asia and the Pacific. President Obama announced a comprehensive five-year plan of action, committing nearly $12 million in the first year. The plan includes strengthening cross-border collaboration, leveraging the private sector to reduce human trafficking in global food supply chains, and supporting research and data collection. The US also supports the implementation of the Convention Against Trafficking in Persons by providing assistance to ASEAN countries. Various programs are in place to protect vulnerable migrants and address trafficking, including training government officials, strengthening coordination within governments, and funding projects focused on prevention, prosecution, and protection. Priority countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Burma, and Laos have received significant programmatic assistance. USAID has bilateral anti-trafficking projects in 11 countries and has already provided assistance to trafficked persons and deportees. The US also engages in diplomacy and publishes the Trafficking in Persons Report to assess and guide foreign government efforts in addressing trafficking.
