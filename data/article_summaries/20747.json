President Obama has proclaimed November 13-19, 2016, as American Education Week. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of education in preparing young people for the future and strengthening democracy. He acknowledges the progress made in improving the education system, such as the increase in high school graduation rates and the implementation of higher standards. However, he also recognizes that there is still work to be done, as many schools are underfunded and lack resources. The Obama administration has focused on various initiatives to improve education, including expanding access to higher education, making college more affordable, and promoting STEM education. The proclamation calls on all Americans to support their local schools and educators during this week and to work towards providing opportunities for every student in America.
