The article discusses the progress made by the Trump Administration in addressing the opioid crisis in the United States. Before President Trump took office, opioid overdose deaths were increasing rapidly. However, official data from 2017 and provisional data from 2018 show that the rise in opioid deaths has stopped and may even be reversing. This is attributed to the administration's efforts to expand treatment, reduce new demand for opioids, and curtail the drug supply.

The Council of Economic Advisers released a report that sheds light on some of the factors that drove the epidemic. The report highlights that the falling out-of-pocket prices for prescription opioids, which were largely due to expanded government health coverage, contributed to a significant portion of the rise in overdose deaths involving prescription opioids between 2001 and 2010. However, the report also emphasizes that falling prices alone could not explain the rise in deaths without the increased availability of prescription opioids due to various factors such as liberalized prescribing practices and deceptive marketing.

The second wave of the opioid epidemic, which began around 2010, saw a shift from prescription opioid abuse to illicit opioid abuse, particularly the infiltration of cheap and potent fentanyl into the drug supply. The article suggests that insufficient action was taken to counteract the increasing supply of illicit fentanyl, leading to an acceleration of overdose deaths.

The Trump Administration is praised for taking swift and serious action to address the root causes of the opioid crisis. While progress has been made, it is acknowledged that reducing the death toll from the epidemic will take time due to the large number of Americans suffering from substance use disorders. Sustained action is needed to overcome this deadly epidemic.
