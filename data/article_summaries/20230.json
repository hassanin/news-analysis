In this memorandum, President Barack Obama directs the Secretary of Labor to propose a rule that would require federal contractors and subcontractors to submit summary data on employee compensation, including data by sex and race. The goal is to address the pay gap between men and women, which still exists despite progress made since the Equal Pay Act of 1963. The lack of sufficient data on employee compensation, including data by sex and race, hinders the effective enforcement of equal pay laws. The Department of Labor had previously solicited stakeholder input on the design of a potential compensation data collection tool and received extensive responses. The proposed rule should maximize efficiency and effectiveness by focusing enforcement resources on entities with potential pay discrepancies, minimize the burden on small entities, and encourage voluntary compliance with federal pay laws. The rule should also rely on existing reporting frameworks and consider independent studies on the collection of compensation data. The memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
