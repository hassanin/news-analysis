The senior administration officials held a teleconference to discuss the upcoming release of the first National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism. The strategy focuses on addressing the elevated threat of domestic terrorism while upholding American civil rights and civil liberties. The strategy is organized into four pillars: understanding and analyzing domestic terrorism-related information, preventing domestic terrorism recruitment and mobilization to violence, disrupting and deterring domestic terrorist activity, and confronting long-term contributors to domestic terrorism. The strategy emphasizes the importance of enhanced information sharing with law enforcement, strengthening prevention resources, increasing public awareness of federal resources, working with tech companies to address online recruitment and mobilization, and addressing broader issues such as economic inequality and structural racism. The strategy does not take a position on whether there should be a new statute criminalizing domestic terrorism. The officials also addressed concerns about political bias, emphasizing that the strategy is focused on violence and the threat of violence, regardless of political ideology. The Defense Department is reviewing its definition of "prohibited extremist activities" and is working to ensure that domestic terrorists are not employed within the military. The strategy also mentions the use of the Bank Secrecy Act to identify and analyze financial activity associated with domestic terrorists.
