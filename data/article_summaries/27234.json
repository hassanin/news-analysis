President Donald J. Trump has taken action to ensure the release of the remaining President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records. The National Archives and Records Administration will make approximately 2,800 records available in full for public access today. The remaining records will be released with agency-proposed redactions on a rolling basis in the coming weeks. The President has directed the agencies to minimize redactions and ensure transparency. The National Archives will release more records, with redactions only in rare cases, by the deadline of April 26, 2018.
