The United States and Central and Eastern European countries have been working together for over 20 years to build a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace. In response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, the United States has taken steps to reinforce its military presence in Central Europe and the Baltics, including increasing air, land, and sea presence, deploying units for joint training and exercises, and providing security-sector assistance programs. The United States is also committed to promoting democracy and the rule of law in the region, working with countries to combat corruption and promote government transparency and accountability. In terms of energy security, the United States is working with countries in the region and the European Union to strengthen energy infrastructure and diversify energy supplies. This includes supporting the extension of energy pipeline networks, increasing gas production, promoting energy efficiency, and developing safe nuclear fuel. The United States is also helping Central and Eastern European countries develop contingency plans for energy disruptions.
