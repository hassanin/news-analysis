On June 29, 2012, the President signed H.R. 6064, the Temporary Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, into law. This law provides funding for programs funded from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) from June 30, 2012, to July 6, 2012. It also extends the authority to make expenditures from the HTF for HTF-financed programs until July 6, 2012. Additionally, the law authorizes the Secretary of Education to delay the origination and disbursement of Federal Direct Stafford loans until the enactment of MAP-21, but only until July 6, 2012.
