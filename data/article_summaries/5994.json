During a teleconference, President Biden and several governors discussed the ongoing wildfire crisis in the Western United States. The President highlighted the severity of the situation, noting that the number of large, uncontained wildfires has nearly doubled in the past month. He also expressed concern about the strain on resources due to the pandemic and emphasized the importance of vaccination. The President announced immediate action to increase the pay of federal firefighters and ongoing efforts to improve their compensation permanently. FEMA has approved 20 Fire Management Assistance Grants totaling up to $100 million to help states cover firefighting costs. The administration is also working to address supply chain challenges and has tapped additional aircraft for firefighting efforts. The EPA has launched an app to provide location-specific information on air quality affected by smoke from wildfires. The President encouraged states to continue partnering with FEMA and using public alert systems to communicate information about wildfires. The President and Vice President then engaged in a discussion with the governors, addressing specific concerns and needs related to wildfire management. Governor Gianforte of Montana stressed the importance of aggressive initial attack and active forest management. Governor Inslee of Washington highlighted the need for additional aerial assets, more boots on the ground, and increased federal support for firefighting efforts. Governor Newsom of California raised concerns about the high cost of undergrounding power lines and the need for more aerial support and access to satellite technology. The governors expressed support for the President's vision for climate investments and emphasized the urgency of taking action to address climate change.
