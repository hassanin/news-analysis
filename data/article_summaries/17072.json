President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New York and authorized federal aid to assist in recovery efforts from severe storms, flooding, tornadoes, and straight-line winds that occurred from April 26 to May 8, 2011. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to the state, eligible local governments, and certain nonprofit organizations for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. John Long has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
