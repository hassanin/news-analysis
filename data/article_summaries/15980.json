First Lady Michelle Obama is partnering with PBS and WGBH Boston to launch the fourth annual Healthy Lunchtime Challenge. The challenge encourages kids, ages 8-12, to submit healthy lunch recipes for a chance to win a trip to Washington, D.C. and attend the Kids' "State Dinner" at the White House. The goal is to promote cooking and healthy eating among youth. Research shows that children who help with cooking and meal preparation are more likely to consume fruits and vegetables and make healthier food choices. The challenge invites kids, with the help of their parents or legal guardians, to create and submit a recipe for a lunch that is nutritious and delicious. The recipes should meet the USDA's recommended nutrition guidelines and include each of the food groups. Kids from all U.S. states and territories are invited to participate. One winner from each state and territory will be flown to Washington, D.C. to attend the Kids' "State Dinner" at the White House, where a selection of the winning recipes will be served. The winning recipes will also be featured in a downloadable e-cookbook. Recipe submissions will be accepted online or by mail until April 30, and winners will be notified in June. Delta Air Lines and The Westin Georgetown will provide travel and accommodations for the winning families.
