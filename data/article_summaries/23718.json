President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring the week of January 10-16, 2010, as National Influenza Vaccination Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of getting vaccinated against the H1N1 influenza virus, which has affected tens of millions of Americans. While most people recover without incident, children and younger adults are at higher risk of developing serious complications. The proclamation encourages expectant mothers, children, young adults, and individuals under 65 with chronic health conditions to get vaccinated as soon as possible. It also urges those not at high risk to get vaccinated to prevent the spread of the virus to more vulnerable individuals. The proclamation emphasizes the availability and safety of the vaccine and directs individuals to visit flu.gov for more information and vaccination sites. The goal of National Influenza Vaccination Week is to prevent a possible third wave of H1N1 flu in the United States and protect families, friends, and neighbors.
