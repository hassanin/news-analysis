President Biden is announcing a two-part plan to respond to the increase in gas prices caused by Putin's actions. Part one involves immediately increasing the supply of oil as a wartime bridge to greater domestic production. This includes proposing a "use it or lose it" policy to incentivize companies to produce more oil in the short term using their existing resources. The President is also announcing a historic release of a million barrels a day for the next six months from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to immediately shore up global supplies. The revenue from the sale of this oil will be used to restock the reserve when prices are lower. The second part of the plan focuses on achieving real American energy independence by accelerating the clean energy transition. President Biden is calling on Congress to pass his plan to speed up the transition to cleaner energy sources, which would save Americans money on gasoline and electricity costs and create millions of jobs. The administration is also taking action to secure American supplies of critical materials needed for clean energy production. The plan includes weatherizing homes, implementing energy efficiency standards, and finalizing new fuel economy standards for vehicles. The administration has had discussions with the oil industry and believes that companies need to step up their production to address the supply shortage. The release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a bridge to additional production, and the administration is committed to restocking the reserve once prices come down. The plan also involves coordinating with allies and partners around the world to release additional oil reserves. The exact timing of the release of the first million barrels is expected to be very soon, with the Department of Energy issuing a notice for May delivery. The administration has been in touch with relevant OPEC partners on energy security and supply.
