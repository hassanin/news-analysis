In these excerpts from President Obama's remarks on health insurance reform, he emphasizes the need to give the American people more control over their own health insurance. He expresses his belief that life-and-death decisions about healthcare should not be left solely to insurance company executives, but should be made by doctors and nurses. The President's proposal aims to hold insurance companies more accountable and allows Americans to keep their current healthcare plans and doctors if they wish. He also mentions incorporating ideas from both Democrats and Republicans, including funding state grants for medical malpractice reform and curbing waste, fraud, and abuse in the healthcare system. President Obama concludes by stating that the ability to solve the healthcare problem is crucial for Washington's credibility in solving any problem, and he urges Congress to finish its work and pass the reform.
