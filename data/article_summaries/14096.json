The White House recently held meetings with business leaders in the insurance and reinsurance industry to discuss the economic consequences of extreme weather events caused by climate change. The discussions focused on sharing data between the government and the insurance industry to better communicate and reduce risks to policyholders, communities, and taxpayers. There was also an emphasis on public education about uninsured risk and the need for more climate-risk-aware investments. The government and industry agreed to collaborate to create broader community resilience. In another meeting, senior White House officials met with a coalition of leaders who released a report called "Risky Business," which highlights the systemic risk of climate change to the economy. The report emphasizes the importance of public and private sector action to reduce carbon pollution and prepare communities for the impacts of climate change. There was agreement that the government and industry must quantify and publicize the economic risks associated with a changing climate and make scientific data available to help officials, communities, and business leaders assess and plan for those risks. The meetings were attended by various insurance and reinsurance industry leaders, as well as individuals from organizations involved in the "Risky Business" report.
