In this proclamation issued by President Donald J. Trump on October 31, 2017, he recognizes the contributions and sacrifices made by Native Americans throughout the history of the United States. He acknowledges their influence in America's development, from helping early European settlers to contributing democratic ideas to the Constitution. The President expresses his commitment to tribal sovereignty and self-determination, as well as his administration's efforts to strengthen American Indian and Alaska Native communities by reviewing regulations and promoting economic well-being. He also pledges to provide assistance to Native American people in times of crisis, as demonstrated by his signing of the first Presidential Emergency Declaration for a tribal nation after Hurricane Irma. President Trump emphasizes the importance of Native American culture and traditions, encouraging all citizens to learn about their rich history. As a result, he proclaims November 2017 as National Native American Heritage Month and designates November 25, 2017, as Native American Heritage Day.
