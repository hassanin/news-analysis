The National Security Council held a teleconference to discuss Venezuela. The senior administration officials discussed the decision to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Venezuelans already in the United States. They emphasized that the President's policies towards Venezuela include supporting the Venezuelan people, increasing international consensus for free and fair elections, combating corruption, and providing humanitarian assistance. They also mentioned that the United States is not rushing to lift sanctions on Venezuela and will review them to ensure they are effective. The officials provided information about the TPS application process, including fees, documentation requirements, and the registration period. They estimated that over 300,000 individuals may be eligible for TPS. The officials addressed concerns about the permanency of TPS and the impact on political support in South Florida. They clarified that TPS is not permanent and mentioned that previous TPS designations have been terminated. The officials also explained the difference between TPS and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED), stating that TPS is statutory while DED is based on presidential discretion. The officials could not provide information on the length of the processing time for TPS applications. The call ended with a reminder that the contents of the call are embargoed until 4:15 p.m.
