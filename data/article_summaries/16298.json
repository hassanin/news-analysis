In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims April as National Financial Literacy Month. He highlights the complexity of the financial system and the need for Americans to have a solid understanding of financial education. The recent economic crisis was caused by irresponsible actions on Wall Street and everyday choices on Main Street. To prevent future crises, new rules are needed to protect consumers and provide them with clear financial information. The President's proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency aims to achieve this. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 has already started addressing deceptive tactics. The President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability is also working on helping individuals make informed decisions and educating children on financial competencies. While the government has a role in protecting consumers, individuals are responsible for understanding basic financial concepts. The article encourages Americans to improve their financial knowledge and share it with their children to prevent another crisis and rebuild the economy on a stronger foundation.
