President Donald Trump has signed an Executive Order imposing new financial sanctions on the dictatorship in Venezuela. The Maduro regime has been accused of depriving the Venezuelan people of food and medicine, imprisoning the opposition, and suppressing freedom of speech. The regime's creation of an illegitimate Constituent Assembly, which has usurped the powers of the democratically-elected National Assembly, is seen as a fundamental break in Venezuela's legitimate constitutional order. The Maduro dictatorship has rewarded corrupt officials by burdening future generations of Venezuelans with expensive debts. The regime's economic mismanagement and plundering of the country's assets have brought Venezuela closer to default. In response, the US is prohibiting dealings in new debt and equity issued by the Venezuelan government and its state oil company, as well as certain existing bonds owned by the Venezuelan public sector. However, the Treasury Department is issuing general licenses to allow for certain transactions and humanitarian assistance. The US is also urging Venezuela to restore democracy, hold free and fair elections, release political prisoners, and end repression. The US sanctions are in line with the regional posture of economically isolating the Maduro regime, as expressed in the Lima Declaration.
