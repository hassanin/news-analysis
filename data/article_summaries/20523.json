Susan Sher, Chief of Staff to Mrs. Obama, will be returning to Chicago after nearly two years of service. She initially started in the White House Counsel's Office in January 2009 and later moved to the East Wing in June 2009 to serve as Chief of Staff to the First Lady. First Lady Michelle Obama expressed her gratitude for Sher's leadership and wise counsel, as well as her generosity in staying longer than planned. President Obama thanked Sher for her service and noted her contributions to their outreach to the Jewish Community and health care reform efforts. A replacement for Sher has not been determined yet.
