The Center for American Progress supports President Obama's American Jobs Act, stating that the country is facing a significant jobs crisis. They believe that the lack of demand in the economy caused by the lack of jobs is the main factor dampening confidence and holding back investment. While most of the plan focuses on spurring private sector job growth through tax cuts for hiring and capital investments, the Center believes that coordinated action is needed and only government can play that role. They also criticize the Republican opposition in Congress for hindering economic recovery and call for their cooperation in passing legislation that will improve employment outlook, such as transportation and FAA bills.
