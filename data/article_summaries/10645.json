President Obama applauds the California State Legislature and Governor Jerry Brown for expanding paid family leave in their state. He believes that this will provide peace of mind for hardworking Californians to take care of a new child or sick family member. However, he notes that millions of Americans still do not have access to any form of paid leave. He calls on Congress to guarantee paid family leave for all Americans, stating that he will continue to do everything he can to ensure this security while he is president.
