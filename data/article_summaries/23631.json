The article discusses the issue of wildlife trafficking and the efforts being made by the United States to combat it. Wildlife trafficking is a form of illicit trade that poses a threat to global security and is driving many species, such as elephants and rhinoceroses, towards extinction. The United States has identified three priorities for addressing this issue: strengthening enforcement, reducing global demand, and building international cooperation and partnerships. The US has invested over $60 million in support of these efforts. They have established a Presidential Task Force and an Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking to implement the National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking. The US also works with African governments to strengthen their capacity to fight wildlife trafficking and supports partner institutions in building their capacity to protect natural resources. They have established regional Wildlife Enforcement Networks in various parts of the world and are supporting community-based solutions. The US is also working to reduce demand for illegally traded wildlife by funding public awareness campaigns and expanding ivory trade controls. They are also seeking to strengthen international cooperation by working with various multilateral fora and partnering with African governments. Additionally, USAID will be launching the Wildlife Trafficking Tech Challenge to seek innovative technology solutions to combat wildlife trafficking.
