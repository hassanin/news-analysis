This article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued on August 8, 2020, regarding continued student loan payment relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. The memorandum states that the coronavirus outbreak has significantly disrupted the lives of Americans, and as a result, relief measures were implemented in March 2020, including the suspension of loan payments and setting interest rates to 0 percent. The relief was originally announced for at least 60 days but was extended multiple times. The memorandum now extends the relief until December 31, 2020. The Secretary of Education is directed to provide appropriate waivers and modifications to deferments for borrowers, allowing them to continue the temporary cessation of payments and the waiver of interest on student loans held by the Department of Education. The memorandum also clarifies that those who wish to continue making payments can do so. The general provisions of the memorandum state that it does not impair any authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, and it must be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The memorandum does not create any substantive or procedural rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities.
