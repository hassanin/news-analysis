Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall and Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm held a meeting with CEOs from the American electricity sector and senior leaders from various government agencies to discuss ways to strengthen public-private cooperation in protecting communities from devastating wildfires. The meeting highlighted the increasing threat of wildfires due to the climate crisis, with this year's number of acres burned being 72% above the 10-year average. Sherwood-Randall emphasized the President's directive to improve prevention, preparedness, and response capabilities through partnerships with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments and the private sector. Granholm stressed the urgency in evolving the national approach to wildfires and outlined steps the Department of Energy is taking, including making $5 billion of grant funding available to increase grid resilience and address the impacts of wildfires and extreme weather events. Utility CEOs discussed their preparations for peak wildfire season and proposed streamlining processes, expediting technology deployment, and improving communication between government and the private sector. They also expressed support for additional resources to enhance wildfire prevention, forest management, and support for frontline firefighters.
