The White House has released the Biden-Harris Administration's Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis, which aims to combat maternal mortality and morbidity in the United States. The plan focuses on reducing disparities in maternal health outcomes and improving the overall experience during and after pregnancy. The Administration is calling on Congress to close the Medicaid coverage gap, provide continuous Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum, and make significant investments to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. The Blueprint outlines five priorities, including increasing access to comprehensive maternal health services, ensuring women have decision-making power in their care, advancing data collection and research, expanding the perinatal workforce, and strengthening economic and social supports for people before, during, and after pregnancy. The plan includes actions such as extending postpartum Medicaid coverage, investing in rural maternal care, establishing a maternal mental health hotline, improving provider training, enhancing maternal health data collection, diversifying the maternal care workforce, expanding access to doulas and midwives, and strengthening workplace protections for mothers. The Administration has already taken steps to address the maternal health crisis, including extending postpartum Medicaid coverage, launching the "Birthing Friendly" Hospitals Initiative, hosting a meeting of Cabinet officials on maternal health, and leading the White House's first-ever Maternal Health Day of Action. The Administration aims to listen to feedback from pregnant individuals and new mothers to inform their approach and improve maternal health.
