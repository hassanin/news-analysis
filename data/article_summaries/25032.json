The White House has released a fact sheet outlining efforts to expand paid sick leave for middle-class families. Currently, the US does not guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave for workers, which puts many families in a difficult position when trying to balance work and family responsibilities. The fact sheet highlights the benefits of paid sick leave, such as reducing turnover and increasing productivity, and calls on Congress to pass legislation expanding paid sick and family leave. The President has signed an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to offer up to seven days of paid sick leave per year. Additionally, the fact sheet mentions other actions taken by the President, such as proposing a rule to extend overtime pay protections and calling for an increase in the minimum wage. The goal of these efforts is to support America's workers, grow the middle class, and provide economic security for all.
