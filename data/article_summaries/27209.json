In this letter, President Donald Trump notifies the Speaker of the House that he has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations, declared in Executive Order 13581 in 2011, will continue beyond July 24, 2019. The President states that these criminal organizations pose a significant threat to the stability of international political and economic systems, as they are becoming more sophisticated and entrenched in foreign governments and the international financial system. These organizations weaken democratic institutions, degrade the rule of law, undermine economic markets, and facilitate violent conflicts and the activities of dangerous individuals. The President determines that the national emergency is necessary to protect the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
