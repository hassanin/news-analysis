In a press conference, President Biden discussed his administration's approach to the situation at the southwest border. He acknowledged that the actions he is announcing would not fix the entire immigration system but would help in managing the challenges at the border. He expressed frustration that congressional Republicans have refused to consider his comprehensive immigration plan and rejected his request for additional funding. The President explained that the current system at the border is not working effectively and outlined steps his administration is taking to improve enforcement and expedite the asylum process. He highlighted the success of a parole program for Venezuelans and announced its expansion to include Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Haitians. Mexico has also agreed to return up to 30,000 individuals per month who are apprehended while attempting to cross the border. The President emphasized that while these actions will improve the situation, comprehensive immigration reform is still needed. He mentioned his upcoming meeting with President LÃ³pez Obrador of Mexico and his visit to the border in El Paso. The President also addressed the issue of migration as a human right, explaining that while seeking asylum is a right, there also needs to be an orderly process to ensure the safety and security of both migrants and the American people. He called for a bipartisan approach to immigration reform and criticized Republicans for using the issue for political gain. The President expressed his belief that the United States can secure the border, fix the immigration system, and uphold its values as a nation of immigrants. He concluded by stating that he will act within his legal capacity to address the issue until Congress passes comprehensive immigration legislation.
