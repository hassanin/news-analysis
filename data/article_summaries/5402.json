On Child Health Day, President Joe Biden emphasizes the importance of providing resources and support for children to thrive. He addresses the issue of gun safety, stating that firearms are the leading cause of death for children in America. He highlights the significant gun safety law he signed and the executive actions taken to keep communities safe, including the establishment of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.

The administration has also invested billions of dollars in improving mental health services for young people, including hiring and training more school mental health counselors. The American Rescue Plan made a substantial investment in mental health and substance use programs, and the gun safety law expands access to care through Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics.

Efforts are being made to make it easier for schools to use Medicaid to deliver mental health care, and the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (988) has been launched to provide immediate help during crises. The administration is working towards achieving full mental health parity for all Americans.

President Biden calls for measures to make the internet a safe place for children, including limiting personal data collection by tech companies and banning targeted advertising directed at minors. Steps have been taken to remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market, which are known to be addictive to children.

In terms of basic needs, the Inflation Reduction Act is aimed at lowering costs for Americans, saving families on health care premiums. The Thrifty Food Plan has been modernized to help families afford a nutritious diet, and efforts are being made to expand free school meals to more children. Child poverty rates have been reduced through the expansion of the Child Tax Credit, and investments have been made in programs that improve maternal and child health.

Addressing the climate crisis is also a priority, with plans to replace all lead pipes in America and make significant investments in climate and environmental justice. The goal is to conserve 30 percent of the nation's lands and waters by 2030.

President Biden concludes by urging everyone to prioritize the health and well-being of children, ensuring they are treated with dignity and respect. He proclaims October 2, 2023, as Child Health Day and calls upon families, professionals, organizations, and governments to work together for the health and safety of America's children.
