President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order to address the threat posed by China's exploitation of US capital for military and security purposes. The order prohibits certain purchases and sales of publicly traded securities of any Communist Chinese military company. It also prohibits US persons from possessing such securities one year after a company is determined to be a Communist Chinese military company. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to publicly list whether a company is a Communist Chinese military company. The order is an amendment to Executive Order 13959, which was signed on November 12, 2020.
