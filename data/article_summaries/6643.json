Intel has announced plans to build a $20 billion facility in Ohio, joining other companies in investing in the United States to strengthen domestic supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the fragility of the global semiconductor supply chain, with the chip shortage impacting various sectors and causing price increases for consumers. The Biden-Harris Administration has been working to expand US chip manufacturing capacity and bring back manufacturing jobs. The investment by Intel will create thousands of construction and permanent jobs. The administration is also urging Congress to pass legislation to strengthen research, development, and manufacturing for critical supply chains. The semiconductor industry has already announced nearly $80 billion in investments in the US since the beginning of 2021. These investments aim to create jobs, support technological leadership, and enhance security in global semiconductor supply chains.
