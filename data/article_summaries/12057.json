The Obama Administration has announced new measures to promote competition in the labor market and accelerate wage growth. These actions are in response to the President's Executive Order issued in April, which called for increased competition for consumers and workers. The Administration aims to address wage collusion, unnecessary non-compete agreements, and other anti-competitive practices. The White House has released an issue brief on how monopsony power affects wages and employment. It highlights the need for greater labor market competition to ensure higher wages, more hiring, and greater economic opportunity and fairness for workers. The Administration is also calling on states to take action to reduce the misuse of non-compete agreements, which restrict employment options for many workers. The White House has provided best practices for state non-compete reform and is releasing a state-by-state report on current non-compete policies. Additionally, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission have released guidance for HR professionals on how to identify and report collusion among employers. These actions build on previous efforts to raise the minimum wage, expand paid sick leave, support worker voice, reform occupational licensing requirements, and reform land use regulations.
