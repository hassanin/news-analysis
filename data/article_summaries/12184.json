President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 16-22, 2012, as National Farm Safety and Health Week in the United States. The proclamation recognizes the important role that farmers and ranchers play in driving the country's progress, from producing food and fuel to advancing clean energy solutions. The proclamation emphasizes the need to keep agricultural workers safe on the job, as they often work long hours and handle heavy machinery and livestock under hazardous conditions. The President encourages farming and ranching families to participate in farm safety and health programs and to carry out safe practices in their daily work. The proclamation also recognizes the contributions of rural communities and calls for strengthening commitment to promoting farm safety and health programs.
