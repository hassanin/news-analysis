President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama extend their warmest wishes to Muslims in the United States and around the world as they celebrate Eid-al-Fitr. They recognize that the past month of Ramadan has been a time of fasting, reflection, spiritual renewal, and service to the less fortunate. Eid marks the completion of Ramadan and celebrates the common values that unite us in our humanity. The Obamas also acknowledge the contributions of Muslim Americans to the fabric of our nation and the strength of our democracy. They stand with people of all faiths to protect and advance their rights to prosper, and they appreciate their commitment to giving back to their communities. The Obama Administration wishes Muslims a blessed and joyous celebration. Eid Mubarak.
