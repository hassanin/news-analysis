This article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Obama regarding responsible antibiotic use in the meat and poultry industry. The memorandum states that overuse and misuse of antibiotics can reduce their effectiveness and lead to antibiotic resistance, which poses a threat to public health and the economy. The memorandum aims to encourage the use of antibiotics in a responsible manner by supporting the market for meat and poultry produced according to responsible antibiotic-use policies. The General Services Administration (GSA) is directed to make meat and poultry produced according to these policies available in federal cafeterias. Additionally, agencies are directed to develop strategies that create a preference for awarding contracts to vendors that offer meat and poultry produced according to responsible antibiotic-use policies in federal cafeterias. The Task Force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria is tasked with reviewing data on customer demand, product supply, and market prices and developing a recommended strategy for creating this preference. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) is directed to propose a rule to implement a preference for meat and poultry produced according to responsible antibiotic-use policies in all federal facilities by 2020. The memorandum also provides definitions for "medically important antibiotics" and "responsible antibiotic-use policies". It concludes by stating that the memorandum must be implemented consistent with applicable law and does not create any right or benefit enforceable against the United States or any other person.
