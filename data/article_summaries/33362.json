Mayor Bowser and Metro general manager Wiedefeld to discuss storm preparations in the Northeast. Spicer also discussed the President's lunch with the Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense of Saudi Arabia, as well as upcoming phone calls with healthcare officials and Republican leaders.

He also mentioned the President's commitment to working with Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy, and Majority Leader McConnell to create a healthcare system that is affordable and accessible to all Americans. Additionally, Spicer discussed the President's upcoming visits to Michigan and Nashville, and the traditional St. Patrick's Day visit by the Taoiseach of Ireland.
