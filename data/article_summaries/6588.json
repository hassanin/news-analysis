President Joe Biden has announced his nominations for key leadership positions in his administration. Among the nominees is Tracey Ann Jacobson, who is being nominated to serve as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Republic of Iraq. Jacobson is a career member of the Senior Foreign Service and has previously served as a U.S. Ambassador to Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kosovo, as well as the Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Riga, Latvia. She has also held senior leadership roles within the State Department and the National Security Council. Jacobson holds a B.A. degree from Johns Hopkins University and an M.A. degree from the School of Advanced International Studies.

Another nominee is Patrick J. Fuchs, who is being nominated to serve as a Member of the Surface Transportation Board. Fuchs has been serving in this role since January 2019 and has worked on transportation policies and railroad legislation during his time on the board. Prior to his appointment, Fuchs worked as a senior professional staff member for the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, where he focused on surface transportation and maritime issues. He has also worked at the Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Department of State. Fuchs holds a B.A. with distinction in economics and political science and an M.P.A. from the University of Wisconsin.

The White House will also be renominating candidates whose nominations were returned to the President at the end of the first session of the 118th Congress. The hope is that the Senate will act quickly on these nominations.
