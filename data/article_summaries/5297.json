President Biden, along with Vice President Harris and other senior administration officials, will be embarking on a nationwide tour to promote the President's economic plan and highlight the success of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The tour will begin on January 4th, with President Biden visiting the Greater Cincinnati area in Kentucky, accompanied by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senator Sherrod Brown, Governor Andy Beshear, and Governor Mike DeWine. Vice President Harris will be in Chicago, Illinois, and Secretary of Transportation Buttigieg will visit New London, Connecticut. Speaker Nancy Pelosi will join White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu during his visit to San Francisco on January 5th. The focus of these visits will be on rebuilding infrastructure, creating jobs that don't require a four-year degree, and revitalizing communities that have been left behind. The President's economic plan aims to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out. The visits will coincide with the Republican-led House of Representatives taking power in Washington.
