President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Belarus will continue beyond June 16, 2014. This national emergency was initially declared in Executive Order 13405 on June 16, 2006. The actions and policies of certain members of the Belarusian government and other individuals to undermine democratic processes, commit human rights abuses, and engage in public corruption are still considered a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
