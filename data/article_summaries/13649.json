The article is a message from President Barack Obama to the Senate of the United States, transmitting a protocol amending the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Japan for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income. The protocol was negotiated to bring U.S.-Japan tax treaty relations in line with current U.S. tax treaty policy. It includes provisions such as an exemption from source-country withholding tax on cross-border interest payments and mandatory arbitration for unresolved cases. President Obama recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the proposed Protocol and consent to its ratification.
