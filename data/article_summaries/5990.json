President Biden will be joining UAW members on a picket line in Wayne County, Michigan to show his support for autoworkers. He believes that cars of the future should be built in America by unionized American workers in good-paying jobs, rather than being built in China. Since taking office, the U.S. economy has added 235,000 auto jobs, which is four times the number of auto jobs per month compared to the previous administration. President Biden wants American autoworkers to receive a record contract as car companies are making record profits. The exact location of the picket line is not disclosed for security reasons. This visit is historic as it is the first time a sitting president has visited a picket line in modern times. The President believes that unions are vital to the middle class and he is known as the most pro-union president in modern times. The visit is focused on standing in solidarity with the autoworkers and supporting their cause. The President will not be meeting with auto executives during this visit. The White House is having internal discussions about essential and nonessential staff in the event of a government shutdown, but no details have been provided. The President is not willing to let the government shut down and believes it would be a Republican shutdown if it happens. The White House is prepared to work with senators from both parties to ensure continued funding for Ukraine. If the government shuts down, the President will remain in Washington, D.C. The President's executive order on artificial intelligence does not have a specific release date at this time.
