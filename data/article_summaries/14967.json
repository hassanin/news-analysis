Vice President Biden announced the progress of the It's On Us campaign, which aims to combat sexual assault, especially on college campuses. Over 200,000 people have taken the It's On Us pledge, and more than 600 events and 300 student-led campaigns have taken place. In addition, over 190 campuses have created their own public service announcements. The campaign has also gained new commitments from organizations such as Funny Or Die, Pandora, USA Network, and several Greek organizations. The It's On Us campaign now includes 75 non-profit and private sector partners. The campaign is part of the White House Task Force to Protect Students From Sexual Assault, which released its first report called Not Alone in April 2014. The task force continues to provide resources to colleges and universities through its website, NotAlone.gov. The goal of the campaign and task force is to address and prevent sexual assault in all educational institutions.
