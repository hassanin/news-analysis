The article provides background information on President Obama's remarks on health insurance reform at Arcadia University in Glenside, Pennsylvania. Leslie Banks, a self-employed single mother with type 2 diabetes, will introduce the President. Leslie had previously expressed her frustration with the cost of health insurance in an email to the President. Her health insurance plan was being dropped, and the premiums for her and her daughter would more than double. The insurance company informed Leslie that there was an across the board premium hike and she had no other options. Under health reform, Leslie and her daughter will have access to affordable health insurance in the new health insurance exchange, including guaranteed benefits such as preventive care and prescription drugs, as well as important consumer protections. Insurance companies will no longer be able to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions, and they will be held accountable to prevent insurance industry abuses.
