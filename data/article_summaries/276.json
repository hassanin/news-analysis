President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has revoked three proclamations related to the suspension of entry into the United States for certain immigrants and nonimmigrants. The revocation is based on the belief that the suspension does not serve the interests of the United States and instead harms the country by preventing family members from joining their loved ones, impacting industries that rely on global talent, and negatively affecting individuals who were selected for immigrant visas through the Diversity Visa Lottery. The revocation allows for the unrestricted entry of the individuals affected by the previous proclamations. The Secretaries of State, Labor, and Homeland Security are tasked with reviewing and revising any regulations and guidance documents related to the previous proclamations. The proclamation also includes general provisions to ensure compliance with applicable law and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities. The proclamation was signed on February 24, 2021.
