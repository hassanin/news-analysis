The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a press briefing on June 21, 2012. The Press Secretary, Jay Carney, discussed various topics including rebates from insurance companies for Americans under the Affordable Care Act, the Fast and Furious investigation, the resignation of Commerce Secretary John Bryson, the situation in Syria, and student loan rates. Carney emphasized that the rebates from insurance companies were a result of the Affordable Care Act and highlighted the importance of the Act in providing consumers with better value for their health care. He also expressed the administration's desire to resolve the Fast and Furious investigation, but criticized House Republicans for focusing on it instead of other pressing issues such as job creation and economic growth. Carney stated that the President had full confidence in Attorney General Eric Holder and that the assertion of executive privilege in relation to the investigation was about protecting the separation of powers and the capacity of the executive branch to operate independently. Regarding the resignation of Commerce Secretary John Bryson, Carney thanked him for his service and stated that Dr. Becky Blank would serve as Acting Commerce Secretary. Carney also discussed the situation in Syria and reiterated the administration's position that President Bashar al-Assad has no place in Syria's future. Finally, Carney addressed the issue of student loan rates, stating that the President has been actively working with members of Congress to prevent the rates from doubling and highlighting the importance of education as an economic issue.
