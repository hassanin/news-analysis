Vice President Kamala Harris is set to launch a nationwide tour to advocate for reproductive freedoms and fight against extremist attacks. The tour will begin in Wisconsin on January 22, the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Harris plans to hold a series of events across the country, bringing together thousands of people to support the freedom of individuals to make decisions about their own bodies. She will highlight the harmful effects of abortion bans and share stories of those affected. Harris will also call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe and outline steps the Administration is taking to safeguard healthcare access. The Vice President has already held over 50 convenings in 16 states since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, engaging with various stakeholders in the fight for reproductive rights. Media details for the tour will be announced soon.
