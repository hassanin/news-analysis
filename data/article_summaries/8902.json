President Biden has achieved stronger economic growth in his first year in office than any other president in the last 50 years. He has focused on reopening the economy and has taken aggressive measures to lower the prices of goods and gasoline for Americans. The Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force has made progress in alleviating bottlenecks caused by the pandemic. The administration is closely monitoring the potential impact of the Omicron variant on global supply chains and is working with ports worldwide to prioritize critical medical supplies. The Trucking Action Plan aims to recruit and retain more truckers by improving job quality and reducing commercial drivers license backlogs. Gas prices have fallen by 12 cents per gallon since last month, with the current average price at $3.30 per gallon, which the President considers too high given the pandemic recovery. Twenty-one states have average gas prices below $3.15, which is below the 10-year and 20-year real averages.
