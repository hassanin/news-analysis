President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818, which addresses human rights abuse and corruption originating outside the United States, will continue beyond December 20, 2023. The President believes that these issues pose a significant threat to the stability of international political and economic systems, as well as to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption undermine democratic institutions, the rule of law, and economic markets, while also perpetuating violent conflicts and facilitating the activities of dangerous individuals. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency declaration in order to address these ongoing threats.
