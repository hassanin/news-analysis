The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet highlighting the administration's efforts to reduce the risk of wildfires in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) exacerbated by climate change. The fact sheet emphasizes that climate change is one of the greatest threats facing the country and that it leads to more extreme weather, including droughts and wildfires. Since 1990, 60% of new homes built in the US have been in the WUI, increasing the risk of structure loss, injury, and death. The fact sheet announces a commitment from over 37 fire chiefs and professional fire associations to combat climate change impacts in the WUI. It also mentions a new study by the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that analyzes the attributes of WUI fire events and provides recommendations for planning and operational considerations. Additionally, a final report from the Wildland Fire Science and Technology Task Force proposes mechanisms to improve coordination between fire-science producers and the fire-management community. The fact sheet concludes by mentioning the President's FY 2016 Budget proposal, which aims to provide necessary resources for the US Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to address wildfire suppression and rehabilitation needs without reducing funding for other critical programs.
