President Donald J. Trump is advocating for a reduction in the tax rate on American businesses to encourage them to keep jobs in the United States, create new jobs, and compete for workers domestically. He supports the unified tax relief framework, which aims to bring back profits that are currently kept offshore by companies. The current corporate tax rate in the United States is the highest among developed economies, which negatively affects both American workers and businesses.
