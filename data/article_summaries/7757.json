The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has released a new report estimating that 720,000 more people would gain Medicaid postpartum coverage if states take action. In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has proposed the establishment of a "Birthing-Friendly" hospital designation and issued guidance to states on how to provide Medicaid coverage for a full year postpartum. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are prioritizing the improvement of maternal health and equity, as the maternal mortality rates in the United States are among the highest in the developed world, especially among Black women and Native American women. The Biden-Harris Administration is issuing a nationwide Call to Action to improve health outcomes for parents and infants in the United States. The Administration is also announcing new commitments to support safe pregnancies and childbirth and reduce complications and mortality in the year following birth. The Build Back Better Act includes provisions for maternal health, which, once passed, will invest in improving maternal health. The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations, and the statistics have worsened over the past 20 years. Black women, Native American women, and women in rural communities are particularly affected by the maternal health crisis. In April, President Biden issued a presidential proclamation for Black Maternal Health Week and requested new funding for maternal health, actions to expand Medicaid coverage, and grant funding for rural maternal care. Vice President Harris has introduced legislation to address the crisis, which is now a part of the Build Back Better Act. President Biden and Vice President Harris are urging the Senate to pass the act and make these reforms a reality.
