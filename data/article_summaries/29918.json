President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Hawaii and has ordered Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts after severe storms and flooding occurred from March 27 to March 28, 2020. The Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Colby Stanton has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made later if requested by the State and warranted by further damage assessments.
