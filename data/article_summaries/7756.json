President Joe Biden has announced that Dr. Alondra Nelson will serve as the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and Dr. Francis Collins will be the Science Advisor to the President and Co-Chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology on an interim basis until permanent leadership is appointed. These appointments will ensure that the OSTP and the President's Science and Technology agenda can continue smoothly. Dr. Nelson, currently the Deputy Director for Science and Society at OSTP, has been instrumental in initiatives to protect the integrity of science, promote diversity in STEM fields, and ensure equitable access to technology and innovation. Dr. Collins, who recently stepped down as the director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), brings extensive experience in biomedical research and genetics. He will continue to run a research lab at NIH while serving in his new role. These appointments reflect President Biden's commitment to prioritizing science and addressing key challenges such as the creation of a new research agency, the Cancer Moonshot, and the advisory work of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.
