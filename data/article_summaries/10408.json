President Obama hosted the 2014 White House Science Fair and celebrated student winners of various STEM competitions. The fair focused on girls and women who are excelling in STEM and inspiring the next generation. As part of his Educate to Innovate campaign, the President announced new steps to encourage more students to excel in STEM subjects. These steps include a $35 million Department of Education competition to train excellent STEM teachers, a major expansion of STEM AmeriCorps to provide STEM learning opportunities for low-income students, and a national STEM mentoring effort in seven cities. Other commitments include free educational software provided to every K-12 school in America, a campaign to engage Hispanic youth in STEM, a global initiative to connect STEM students with each other and leading scientists, and a partnership between Khan Academy and NASA to provide interactive lessons on math and science. Existing partners in the President's call to action, such as Time Warner Cable and the Association of Science-Technology Centers, continue their efforts to engage youth in STEM learning.
