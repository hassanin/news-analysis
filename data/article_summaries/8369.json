President Biden is set to welcome Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan to the White House on January 13th. The meeting aims to strengthen ties between the two countries in various areas, including government, economy, and people-to-people connections. Over the past year, they have collaborated on modernizing the U.S.-Japan Alliance, expanding cooperation on climate change and critical technologies through the Quad, and promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific. The leaders will discuss regional and global issues such as North Korea's weapons programs, Russia's conflict with Ukraine, and maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. President Biden will express his support for Japan's National Security Strategy, its presidency of the G7, and its role as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. The meeting will highlight the strong alliance between the U.S. and Japan and set the direction for their partnership in the coming year.
