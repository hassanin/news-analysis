White House Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall and Senior Advisor to the President Julie Rodriguez held a call with mayors from various cities to discuss federal preparations for the release of footage showing the brutal death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee. The mayors emphasized the importance of recognizing the pain felt by communities, being prepared with a game plan to provide community support, and promoting peace and calm. White House officials asked the mayors to stay in regular contact and reiterated the President's message that peaceful protests are appropriate, but violence is not acceptable. Mayors and senior officials from cities such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, and New York City participated in the call.
