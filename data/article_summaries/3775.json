The article discusses an executive order issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to establish an advisory council on science, technology, and innovation called the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). The PCAST will consist of up to 26 members, including the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and distinguished individuals from sectors outside the federal government. The council's role is to advise the President on policy matters related to science, technology, and innovation and provide scientific and technological information for public policy decisions. The PCAST will also serve as the advisory committee for the President's Innovation and Technology Advisory Committee and the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel. The heads of executive departments and agencies are required to provide the PCAST with information upon request. The Department of Energy will provide funding and support to the PCAST, and members will serve without compensation but may receive travel expenses. The executive order revokes a previous order and states that the PCAST will terminate after two years unless extended by the President. The order does not affect the authority of executive departments and agencies or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
