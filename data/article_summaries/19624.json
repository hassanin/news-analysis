On November 3, 1997, President Obama declared a national emergency with respect to Sudan due to the threat it posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In 2006, the President expanded the scope of the national emergency to include the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region and ordered the blocking of property of certain individuals connected to the conflict. Additional steps were taken in October 2006 to implement the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act. The President has determined that the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 1997, expanded in 2006, and with additional steps taken in 2006, will continue for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
