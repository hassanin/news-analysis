The Trump administration is disappointed with a recent judicial ruling that has blocked their efforts to enforce the public charge ground of inadmissibility on a nationwide basis. The administration argues that this ruling prevents immigration officers from ensuring that immigrants seeking entry to the United States will be self-sufficient and not rely on public resources. They believe that the ruling is an example of the administration being ordered to comply with the flawed guidance of a previous administration instead of the laws passed by Congress.
