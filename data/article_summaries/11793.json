President Barack Obama has sent a message to the Senate recommending ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts. The Convention sets rules for the use of electronic communications in international business transactions, which will promote legal uniformity and lower costs for US businesses engaged in electronic commerce. The provisions of the Convention are similar to US laws on electronic commerce, such as the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act and the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. The US government was involved in the negotiation of the Convention and its accession is expected to encourage other countries to join. The Convention would be implemented through separate federal legislation proposed by the Obama administration. Leading associations and organizations in this area, such as the American Bar Association and the United States Council on International Business, have endorsed the Convention. President Obama urges the Senate to give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and provide its advice and consent to ratification, subject to certain understandings and declarations.
