On January 24, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation to adjust the tariffs on certain derivative articles of aluminum and steel imported into the United States. The proclamation states that imports of these derivative articles have increased significantly since the imposition of tariffs on aluminum and steel articles in previous proclamations. These imports threaten to undermine the actions taken to address the national security risks identified in the previous proclamations. As a result, the President has decided to apply additional tariffs on these derivative articles, with a 10 percent ad valorem rate for derivative aluminum articles and a 25 percent ad valorem rate for derivative steel articles. The tariffs will apply to imports from most countries, except for certain exceptions like Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Mexico. The Secretary of Commerce will continue to monitor imports of these derivative articles and may take further action if there is a surge in imports from any excepted country. The proclamation also allows for relief from the additional duties for derivative articles that are not produced in sufficient quantity or of satisfactory quality in the United States, based on specific national security considerations.
