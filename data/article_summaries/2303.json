President Biden will sign an Executive Order today to implement significant military justice reforms that aim to strengthen how the military handles sexual assault cases. The reforms transfer decision-making authority from commanders to independent military prosecutors in cases of sexual assault, domestic violence, murder, and other serious offenses. These changes, which were passed by Congress in the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, represent the most significant transformation of the military justice system since 1950. The reforms aim to better protect victims and ensure prosecutorial decisions are independent from the chain of command. They are a result of efforts by survivors, advocates, and Members of Congress, as well as recommendations from the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military. President Biden has prioritized addressing gender-based violence throughout his career and sees these reforms as a turning point for survivors in the military. The Executive Order aligns with the President's commitment to caring for servicemembers and their families by promoting dignity, respect, and safety within the military. The reforms also build on previous progress made by the Department of Defense in implementing recommendations from the Independent Review Commission.
