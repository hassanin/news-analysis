The President met with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to discuss the need for immigration reform that is fair and supports the middle class. He thanked the Members for their leadership and emphasized that this is a top priority. The President stated that any legislation must include a path to earned citizenship and that there is no excuse for stalling or delay. He plans to continue leading on this issue and will be traveling to Nevada to work with Congress on fixing the immigration system.
