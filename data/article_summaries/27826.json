The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced $15.9 million in discretionary funding for its High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program, in addition to the $266 million in baseline funding released earlier this year. This represents the highest award level ever for the HIDTA program. The funding will expand the HIDTA Overdose Response Strategy (ORS) to all 50 states, aiming to reduce overdoses and save lives through a public health-public safety partnership. The ORS works on law enforcement, response, treatment and recovery, and prevention efforts at the federal, state, and local levels. The ONDCP's discretionary funding allocation will support these strategic efforts.
