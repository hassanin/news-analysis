On March 17, 2009, President Barack Obama sent a message to Congress regarding the export of certain materials and equipment to China. The President certified that the export of fine grain graphite for solar cell applications and electronic and semiconductor fabrication, as well as dual-motor, dual-shaft mixers for carbon fiber and epoxy prepregs used in the commercial airline industry, would not harm the U.S. space launch industry. He also stated that these exports would not significantly enhance China's missile or space launch capabilities. The message was in accordance with the provisions of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.
