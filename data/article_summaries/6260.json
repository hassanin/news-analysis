The United Nations International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals in The Hague has affirmed the conviction of Ratko Mladic for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. This judgment demonstrates that individuals who commit horrific crimes will be held accountable. The United States played a significant role in ending the atrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, bringing justice to those responsible, and establishing lasting peace in the region. The decision reinforces the importance of justice and reconciliation for future peace and stability. It is hoped that leaders in the region will respect this judgment and uphold the rule of law. The thoughts are with the surviving families of Mladic's victims, and while the tragedy cannot be erased, it is hoped that the judgment provides some solace to those grieving.
