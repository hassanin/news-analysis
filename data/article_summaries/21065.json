The President praises the House of Representatives for passing the Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act. The bill aims to prevent bid-rigging, price-fixing, and other practices that increase healthcare costs. Repealing the antitrust exemption for health insurers is seen as a significant step towards giving people more control over their healthcare. The President plans to meet with congressional leaders to further discuss healthcare reform.
