On April 7, 2014, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 4275, is called the "Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act." This bill changes the funding rules for multiple employer defined benefit pension plans provided by cooperative associations and charities. The second bill, S. 1557, is called the "Children's Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2013." This bill extends and reauthorizes funding for payments to children's hospitals with approved graduate medical residency training programs until Fiscal Year 2018.
