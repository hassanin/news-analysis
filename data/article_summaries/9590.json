On January 17, 2014, President Barack Obama signed an executive order to establish the Afghanistan and Pakistan Strategic Partnership Office (APSPO) within the Department of State. The purpose of APSPO is to support executive departments and agencies in facilitating a strategic partnership between the US Government and the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan. This partnership aims to promote security, stabilization, and a normalized diplomatic presence in both countries. The APSPO will assist in transitioning to a strategic partnership in various fields such as economics, diplomacy, culture, technology, and security. It will also coordinate the drawdown of the State Department's civilian field operations and staff in Afghanistan, oversee the administration of certain State Department assistance funds, and perform other functions assigned by the Secretary of State. The APSPO will be headed by a Director appointed by the Secretary and will be based in Washington, D.C., Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The executive order also amends Executive Order 12163 by delegating certain determination functions. The APSPO will terminate at the end of the maximum period permitted by law, unless terminated sooner by the Secretary. The implementation of this order is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations. It does not impair the authority of any department or agency or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
