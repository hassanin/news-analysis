President Obama has created the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling to provide recommendations on preventing and mitigating future oil spills resulting from offshore drilling. The commission will be bipartisan and will be chaired by former Senator Bob Graham and William K. Reilly, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The commission will focus on environmental and safety precautions to prevent accidents like the Deepwater Horizon spill and will consider other investigations into the causes of the spill. The commission will consist of seven members representing various fields of expertise and will issue a report within six months of its creation. The president appointed Senator Bob Graham and William K. Reilly as co-chairs of the commission. Senator Graham served as governor of Florida for two terms and 18 years in the US Senate. William K. Reilly is a founding partner of Aqua International Partners and has served in various environmental and energy-related positions. In his weekly message, President Obama emphasized the need to hold BP and other responsible parties accountable for the spill and to learn from the disaster to prevent future incidents. He also highlighted the importance of comprehensive regulation and oversight of the oil and gas industry.
