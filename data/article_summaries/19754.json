President Obama has announced a series of actions to support state, local, and tribal leaders in preparing their communities for the impacts of climate change. These actions include providing federal resources through the National Disaster Resilience Competition, helping tribes prepare for climate impacts, investing in rural electric infrastructure, developing advanced mapping data and tools, safeguarding access to quality drinking water during droughts, establishing a Mitigation Integration Task Force, accounting for climate change in hazard mitigation planning, committing to "Preparedness Pilots" in Houston and Colorado, making coastal areas more resilient, improving stormwater management through green infrastructure, and assessing climate-related health hazards. These actions aim to create more resilient infrastructure and better prepare communities for future extreme weather events and other climate impacts.
