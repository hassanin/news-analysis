President Biden expresses his commitment to preventing elder abuse and mentions that his administration has allocated $178 million through the American Rescue Plan and the COVID-19 recovery bill to improve the work of Adult Protective Services (APS). He also proposes ongoing support for APS and State Long-Term Care Ombudsman programs in his budget proposal for 2023. The President emphasizes the need to reform guardianship, support adult decision-making, combat scammers and fraudsters, and empower victims of exploitation.

Additionally, President Biden calls for significant reforms to improve the safety and quality of care in nursing homes and highlights the importance of supporting caregivers. He emphasizes the goal of ensuring a high quality of life and care for older Americans to honor their dignity. 

In recognition of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, President Biden proclaims June 15, 2022, as a day to raise awareness and work together to strengthen existing partnerships and develop new opportunities to prevent and respond to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. He encourages all Americans to be diligent in their efforts to support older adults and create a world free from abuse and neglect.
