The Obama Administration has announced new efforts to combat and prevent domestic violence in the federal workplace. President Obama signed a memorandum that requires federal agencies to develop policies addressing the effects of domestic violence and providing assistance to employees experiencing it. The goal is to create a safe workplace and support for victims of domestic violence. The memorandum also directs various agencies to issue guidance on intervening and preventing domestic violence, assisting victims, implementing leave policies, and improving workplace safety. Domestic violence affects workplace safety and employee productivity. While the Violence Against Women Act has led to a decrease in incidents, domestic violence remains a significant problem. President Obama and Vice President Biden have prioritized addressing domestic violence since the beginning of their administration. The Violence Against Women Act expired in 2011, but the federal government is taking action while waiting for Congress to reauthorize it.
