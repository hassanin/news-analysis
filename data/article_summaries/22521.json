President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 17, 2013, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 12 through May 18, 2013, as National Transportation Week. In his proclamation, Obama emphasizes the importance of rebuilding the infrastructure that powers the country's industries and making cities more connected and resilient. He also mentions the need to restore roads, bridges, and ports, which are essential for business and economic growth. Obama proposes a "Fix-It-First" program to prioritize transportation projects and attract private capital to upgrade infrastructure. He highlights that investing in transportation is not only about economic growth but also about security, as it enables first responders and service members to effectively respond during crises. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to recognize the significance of the nation's transportation infrastructure and appreciate the contributions of those who build, operate, and maintain it.
