The White House has announced the launch of worker.gov, a new online tool that helps workers understand their rights under federal worker protection statutes. The tool guides workers on a structured journey that provides opportunities to take action or find help if they have had wages stolen, been injured on the job, faced discrimination, or been retaliated against for seeking better wages or conditions at work. The website was developed in response to feedback received during the White House Summit on Worker Voice and other listening sessions with workers across the nation. The tool allows workers to describe themselves and their concerns and eliminates guesswork about which federal agency or statute covers their complaint. The website was created in partnership with a team of Presidential Innovation Fellows and will continue to evolve and improve based on user feedback. The article also highlights some examples of private sector action taken in response to President Obama's call to action, including initiatives by organizations such as Centro de Tabajadores Unidos en Lucha, Coworker.org, Jobs to Move America, Kaiser Permanente, Glassdoor, and The Workers Lab. The article also mentions regional summits that were held across the country to bring together workers, organizers, unions, and employers to discuss issues related to worker voice and empowerment. Finally, the article highlights some of the actions taken by the Obama Administration to expand worker voice and bargaining power, such as requiring contractors to notify employees of their collective action rights and granting collective bargaining rights for TSA employees.
