President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is making significant progress in repairing thousands of bridges across the United States. The Fern Hollow Bridge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which collapsed while the President was visiting eight months ago, is being rebuilt in just one year, thanks to the accelerated timeline made possible by the infrastructure law. This bridge is one of nearly 45,000 bridges in poor condition that need repair or replacement. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes a historic $40 billion investment for bridge repair and replacement, and in less than a year, over 2,400 bridge projects have already begun. The Department of Transportation launched the Bridge Formula Program, providing funding for states, tribes, and territories to repair bridges over five years. Additional funding has been announced for fiscal year 2023, and a Bridge Investment Program has been established with $12.5 billion to repair economically significant bridges. The DOT has also awarded funds for bridge planning projects to create a pipeline of construction-ready projects. The awards for large bridge projects will be announced later this year.
