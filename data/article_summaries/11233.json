On March 22, 2013, the White House announced the withdrawal of Caitlin Joan Halligan's nomination to be a United States Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit. Halligan was nominated by President Obama on January 4, 2013, to replace John G. Roberts, Jr., who had been elevated to Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. However, the nomination was withdrawn before it was sent to the Senate for confirmation.
