The Biden-Harris Administration is pushing for bipartisan permitting reform legislation as part of its Investing in America agenda. This agenda aims to invest in infrastructure and clean energy, create union jobs, boost the economy, ensure energy security, combat climate change, promote environmental justice, and lower costs for families. The administration has already allocated over $470 billion for manufacturing and clean energy investments and secured $1 billion for expediting federal agency permitting. The Inflation Reduction Act is expected to increase near-term clean energy deployment by 25%. The administration is taking steps to accelerate the federal permitting process, including establishing a new interagency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for electric transmission infrastructure. However, further reforms are needed to develop modern American energy infrastructure and supply chains quickly and safely. For example, outdated laws governing mineral claims need to be updated to protect the environment, communities, and maintain global competitiveness. The Biden-Harris Administration supports the Building American Energy Security Act of 2023 as a bipartisan compromise and urges the inclusion of recommendations to streamline the permitting process.
