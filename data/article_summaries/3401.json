In a speech at the Rose Garden, Vice President Kamala Harris thanked Congress and President Joe Biden for passing the American Rescue Plan, a landmark legislation that provides relief to families, support to communities, and ensures more COVID-19 vaccinations. She praised Biden's empathy, noting that he carries a card with the number of Americans who have died from the virus and has shown genuine concern for the American people. Harris emphasized that the American Rescue Plan will have a tangible impact, with Americans seeing checks in their bank accounts, child tax credits, and the reopening of businesses and schools. She commended Biden's vision and work in getting the plan passed, highlighting the historic investments in communities of color, tribal communities, and rural communities, as well as the lifting of children out of poverty. Harris concluded by thanking Biden on behalf of the nation and introducing him to speak.
