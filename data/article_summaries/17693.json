On May 31, 2012, the President signed H.R. 5740 into law. This bill reauthorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to enter into new contracts for flood insurance and borrow from the Treasury up to specified amounts until July 31, 2012. Additionally, starting from July 1, 2012, subsidized premium rates for residential properties that are not the primary residence of an individual will be phased out under the NFIP.
