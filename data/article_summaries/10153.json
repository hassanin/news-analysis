Vice President Joe Biden and Michael J. Astrue, Commissioner of Social Security, have announced that the federal government will provide $250 economic recovery payments to individuals who receive Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. These payments will be sent separately from the regular monthly payments and will begin in early May 2009 and continue throughout the month. The payments aim to inject more than $13 billion into the economy. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allows for a one-time payment of $250 to adult Social Security beneficiaries and SSI recipients, with the exception of those receiving Medicaid in care facilities. To be eligible for the payment, individuals must have been eligible for Social Security or SSI during the months of November 2008, December 2008, or January 2009. Veterans Affairs (VA) and Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) beneficiaries will also receive a one-time payment under their respective programs. Individuals receiving multiple benefits will only receive one $250 payment. Recipients of Social Security or SSI should not contact the agency unless they have not received the payment by June 4, 2009.
