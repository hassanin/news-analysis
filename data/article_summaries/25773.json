President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed October 20-26, 2019, as National Forest Products Week, recognizing the importance of the forest products industry to the American society and economy. The forest products sector is a significant contributor to the US economy, providing jobs and resources for various products such as paper, packaging materials, lumber, and renewable energy materials. The industry also practices responsible resource management and conservation efforts. The President has signed an Executive Order and the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 to protect and manage the nation's forests, prevent wildfires, and promote the use of forest materials in innovative construction. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities and reaffirm their commitment to the nation's forests.
