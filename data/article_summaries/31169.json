This executive order, issued on December 28, 2020, addresses the impact of school closures on students during the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the prolonged lack of in-person learning has had dire consequences for children, including increased risk of depression, abuse, and reduced food security and physical activity. It particularly highlights the difficulties faced by students with special needs, low-income and minority children, and those whose families pay for private education. The order aims to provide emergency learning scholarships to disadvantaged families, allowing them to access various educational options such as private schools, homeschooling, special education services, or tutoring. The order also states that it does not impede the authority of executive departments or agencies, and its implementation is subject to applicable law and available funding. It clarifies that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
