Members of Congress, cabinet members, administration officials, advocacy organizations, business leaders, and policy experts have expressed support for President Trump's plan to impose tariffs on Chinese goods as a response to China's unfair trade practices. They believe that China has engaged in intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, and other unfair trade practices for years, and that it is time for the US to take action to protect American businesses and workers. They see these tariffs as a way to level the playing field and push back against China's economic aggression. Some also argue that China's actions pose a threat to US national security.
