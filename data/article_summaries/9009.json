The U.S. is rolling out President Biden's comprehensive vision for an Indo-Pacific that is free, open, prosperous, secure, and resilient. Secretary of State Blinken is currently in the region to share the strategy with partners and strengthen diplomatic relationships. The strategy aims to strengthen the U.S. role in the region and build collective capacity to address 21st century challenges such as climate change, PRC behavior, and pandemic preparedness. The strategy builds on previous administrations' work and has bipartisan support. It focuses on advancing freedom and openness, building collective capacity, promoting shared prosperity, bolstering Indo-Pacific security, and building regional resilience. The strategy does not specifically target China but recognizes the Indo-Pacific as a region of intense competition. The U.S. aims to shape the strategic environment around China and work with allies and partners to advance shared interests. The timing of the strategy's release reflects the importance the administration places on the region and the need for coordination across different departments and agencies. The ongoing situation in Ukraine and Russia does not explicitly impact the strategy, but the principles of freedom of choice and maintaining peace and stability are relevant. The U.S. recognizes the importance of economic engagement in the region and is developing an Indo-Pacific economic framework to promote shared prosperity. The framework will address challenges such as supply chain disruptions and will reflect input from partners in the region.
