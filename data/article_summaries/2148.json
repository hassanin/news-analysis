Under President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, nearly four million seniors on Medicare with diabetes had their insulin costs capped at $35 per month. Now, Eli Lilly, the largest manufacturer of insulin in the US, has announced that they are lowering the cost of insulin by 70% and capping what patients pay out-of-pocket at $35. This move could benefit millions of Americans with diabetes across all states and territories. The President is calling on Congress to extend this benefit to all Americans. The data shows that these cost-saving measures will have a greater impact on communities of color, as they have higher rates of diabetes compared to white Americans. The article provides additional information on how many seniors in each state are already benefiting from the President's actions.
