The US Department of the Treasury has announced sanctions on two individuals from Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security for their involvement in the abduction, detention, and likely death of Robert Levinson. The US government holds senior Iranian officials responsible for Levinson's disappearance and accuses them of attempting to hide their involvement through a disinformation campaign. This marks the first public action by the US against the Iranian government in relation to Levinson's abduction, and the investigation will continue to pursue others involved. The Trump administration has emphasized that Iran will be held accountable for its use of detention and hostage-taking as a diplomatic tool, and that the US will no longer accept Iranian excuses for their actions. The US stands with the Levinson family and will continue efforts to bring justice for them.
