The United States has expressed deep concern over ongoing human rights abuses in The Gambia. The Gambian government has denied access to UN Special Rapporteurs investigating reports of torture and extrajudicial execution, targeted individuals based on their perceived sexual orientation or political position, and enacted legislation that imposes a possible life sentence for "aggravated homosexuality." There have also been reports of forced disappearances, arbitrary arrests of journalists, human rights advocates, and civil servants, and calls for the persecution of members of the LGBTQ+ community. The Gambian government's failure to investigate the disappearance of two U.S. citizens missing since June 2013 is also a source of disappointment. The United States urges the Government of The Gambia to respect human rights, repeal discriminatory laws, and put an end to these harmful practices.
