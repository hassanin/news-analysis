The article discusses Nan Warshaw, a small business owner in Chicago, Illinois, who makes health insurance decisions for her seven-person staff. Nan has seen premiums for health insurance skyrocket in recent years. However, thanks to the tax credits for small businesses in the Affordable Care Act, providing health insurance for her employees will be a little easier. The Affordable Care Act provides tax credits for small businesses that offer employees health insurance, potentially benefiting up to 4 million small businesses. The law also allows small businesses to band together to get a fairer deal from insurance companies through the creation of competitive private health insurance markets called Exchanges. These Exchanges will go into effect in 2014 and will help organize the health insurance marketplace, making it easier for consumers and small businesses to compare costs and benefits.
