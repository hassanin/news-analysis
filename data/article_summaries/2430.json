The United States government hosted the U.S.-Ukraine Defense Industrial Base Conference in Washington, D.C. on Ukrainian Armed Forces Day. The conference aimed to increase weapons production to support Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression and strengthen its long-term self-defense. Both the U.S. and Ukrainian governments are working together to develop a self-reliant defense industrial base in Ukraine that contributes to its security and economic success. The initial focus of the conference was to establish relationships and dialogue between industry and government partners, which will expand cooperation and provide Ukraine with the necessary capabilities for both short-term battlefield success and long-term economic recovery and defense.
