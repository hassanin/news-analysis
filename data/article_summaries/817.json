Fifty-six years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law, surrounded by activists and leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, John Lewis, and Rosa Parks. This act is considered one of the most significant pieces of legislation in American history, as it led to a significant increase in voter registration among Black Americans in the South. However, on the anniversary of its signing, it is noted that voting rights are once again being threatened. The Supreme Court has weakened the Voting Rights Act, leading to the passage of anti-voter legislation in many states. This year alone, 18 states have passed 30 laws that make it more difficult for Americans to vote. To combat this, there are two important bills currently in Congress—the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act—which the current administration fully supports. It is acknowledged that the fight for voting rights has never been easy, but it is crucial to continue this fight to ensure that every American's right to vote is protected and their votes are counted.
