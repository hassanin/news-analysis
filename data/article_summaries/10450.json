President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Oklahoma and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts from severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from May 22-25, 2011. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in several counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named a Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area and additional designations may be made in the future. Residents and business owners who sustained losses can apply for assistance online or by phone.
