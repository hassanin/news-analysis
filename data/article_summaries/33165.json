In this article, Secretary David Shulkin discusses the efforts being made to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and honor veterans on Veterans Day. He mentions that the president and Congress have enacted several pieces of legislation on various veterans issues, such as accountability, whistleblower protection, choice in healthcare, educational benefits, and appeals modernization. The VA has established the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection to discipline or terminate employees who violate the public trust. They have also created an advisory committee to address fraud, waste, and abuse. The VA has improved transparency by posting information on employee disciplinary actions online. They have implemented same-day services for primary and mental health care, made it easier for veterans to file online health-care application forms, and initiated the process of replacing the VistA electronic health records system. The VA is also disposing of vacant and underutilized buildings. They have developed a predictive modeling tool called REACH VET to identify and treat veterans at higher risk for suicide, and launched a suicide prevention awareness campaign. The VA is working with Congress on the Veterans CARE Act, which aims to improve access to care. Secretary Shulkin concludes by highlighting the progress made in recent months and expressing the commitment to continue improving services for veterans.
