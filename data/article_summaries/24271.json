The United Kingdom has announced that it will be joining the United States in shifting public financing towards cleaner energy sources. This decision aligns with President Obama's Climate Action Plan, which calls for an end to US support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, except in certain cases. The US is pleased with the UK's decision and looks forward to working together to encourage other countries to implement similar policies.
