President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Oklahoma in response to a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in February 2013. This declaration allows for federal funding to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and snow assistance. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed a Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
