President Trump has issued an Executive Order on Promoting Small Modular Reactors for National Defense and Space Exploration. The order aims to revitalize the US nuclear energy sector, strengthen the space exploration program, and provide diverse energy options for national defense needs. The use of small modular reactors for national defense and space exploration will help maintain and advance US leadership in both domains. The Department of Defense will establish a plan to demonstrate the energy flexibility and cost-effectiveness of a small modular reactor at a domestic military installation. Additionally, NASA will explore the use of nuclear energy systems for human and robotic exploration missions until 2040. The order emphasizes the importance of adhering to high standards for nuclear nonproliferation and safety.
