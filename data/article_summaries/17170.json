In this statement, Vice President Biden acknowledges the prevalence of violence against women and girls worldwide. While progress has been made, he recognizes that many women still face the daily threat of violence. He emphasizes that ending this problem requires the collective effort of the international community, civil society, and local heroes who work tirelessly to combat violence against women in their own communities. On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, he reaffirms the commitment to supporting women and girls who suffer from violence. He believes that no country can progress unless women and girls have the opportunity to reach their full potential, and pledges to work towards a world where everyone can pursue their dreams without fear.
