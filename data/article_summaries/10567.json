President Obama is set to sign the Small Business Jobs Act, a bill aimed at providing support and incentives to small businesses to help them grow and hire. The bill includes various proposals that the President had put forth earlier in the year. The bill includes immediate extensions of successful Small Business Administration (SBA) Recovery Act provisions, allowing small businesses to restart their SBA Recovery lending. The bill also includes eight new small business tax cuts, all effective immediately, providing incentives for businesses to make new investments and expand. The bill also extends and expands small businesses' ability to immediately expense capital investments, allows for a deduction of health insurance costs for self-employed individuals, and provides relief and simplification for cell phone deductions, among other provisions. The bill also includes provisions to support small business lending, with the SBA starting to fund new Recovery loans within a few days of the President's signature. The bill also increases the maximum loan size for SBA loan programs, allowing more small businesses to access credit. The Treasury is also working to implement two new programs, the Small Business Lending Fund and the State Small Business Credit Initiative, to support private-sector lending to small businesses. The signing of the bill will be attended by a group of small business owners who will benefit from the new legislation.
