President Obama expresses his deep sadness at the passing of Bishop Arthur M. Brazier, a prominent figure in Chicago and a moral leader in the nation. Bishop Brazier, who grew up during the Great Depression, understood the impact of poverty on communities and served as a staff sergeant in the US Army during World War II. He dedicated his life to promoting spiritual empowerment and economic development through his work as a pastor and his leadership of various community organizations and charitable efforts. President Obama acknowledges that Bishop Brazier's contributions to Chicago and the nation cannot be replaced, but believes that his spirit will live on through the people he touched. The President offers his condolences to the Brazier family, the Apostolic Church of God, and the city of Chicago, and pledges to honor Bishop Brazier's legacy through continued service to others.
