The finalization of Iraq's Gas Growth Integrated Project (GGIP) with French firm TotalEnergies, along with participation from regional and American companies, is a significant development for Iraq's energy self-sufficiency and climate goals. The project aims to increase domestic electricity supply and reduce health problems caused by gas flaring. The United States fully supports Iraq's efforts to enhance domestic resilience and diversify its energy supply. The project, along with ongoing programs to connect Iraq's electricity grid to the grids in the GCC and Jordan, will greatly enhance Iraq's energy security and reliability. The US will continue to work closely with Iraq's government to ensure that the country's natural resources benefit its people and address their needs.
