Vice President Biden and other administration officials are traveling across the country to hold "Recovery Summer" events and visit Recovery Act project sites. The Recovery Act has funded thousands of projects and created jobs for millions of Americans. This summer, there is a surge in new projects breaking ground, creating more jobs and economic growth. Vice President Biden visited Yellowstone and Grand Canyon National Parks, which received $25 million in Recovery Act funding. There are 800 Recovery Act projects underway at National Parks this summer, eight times as many as last summer. Other officials are visiting various locations, such as Washington, DC, Florida, Nevada, Colorado, Wisconsin, and Delaware, to attend groundbreaking ceremonies, visit housing projects, and participate in events related to the Recovery Act. Overall, the Recovery Act has provided much-needed capital to small businesses, supported affordable housing developments, and funded green rehabilitation projects.
