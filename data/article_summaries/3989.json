Vice President Kamala Harris will be making an announcement during a White House event on March 16th, 2022 regarding the recent bomb threats that have been targeting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the United States. While no explosive devices have been found, these threats have caused significant disruptions to campus life and have increased stress and anxiety among HBCU students. The Biden-Harris Administration is taking a comprehensive approach to address these threats, including providing grant funds through the Project School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) program to HBCUs that have experienced bomb threats. The funds can be used for immediate needs such as mental health resources and enhanced security. In addition to these short-term funds, the administration is also providing HBCUs with a compendium of resources from various federal agencies to support long-term improvements to campus mental health programs, safety, and emergency management. This announcement builds on the administration's previous investments in HBCUs, totaling $5.8 billion, to address critical needs exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The administration recognizes the importance of educational opportunity and the historic role HBCUs have played in securing that opportunity for Black people.
