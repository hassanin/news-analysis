This executive order, signed by President Barack Obama on January 17, 2017, amends the Civil Service Rules, Executive Order 13488, and Executive Order 13467. The purpose of the order is to modernize the executive branch-wide governance structure and processes for security clearances, suitability and fitness for employment, and credentialing. It aims to ensure that all individuals working for or on behalf of the government are loyal, reliable, trustworthy, and of good conduct and character. The order includes amendments to the Civil Service Rules, changes to Executive Order 13488 regarding fitness determinations, and revisions to Executive Order 13467 to strengthen and ensure a secure, efficient, timely, reciprocal, and aligned system for investigating and determining suitability or fitness for government employment. The order establishes the Security, Suitability, and Credentialing Performance Accountability Council, the Suitability and Credentialing Executive Agent, and the Security Executive Agent to oversee and implement the vetting process. The National Background Investigations Bureau is designated as the primary executive branch service provider for background investigations, and the Department of Defense is responsible for designing, developing, and operating the vetting information technology systems. The order also emphasizes continuous evaluation and reciprocity in the vetting process and ensures that actions taken under the order are consistent with national security interests and the President's constitutional authority.
