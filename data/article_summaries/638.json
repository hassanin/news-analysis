In a recent article, it was reported that the President had a conversation with Senator Sinema to express gratitude for her work on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Agreement. The President reiterated his strong support for the compromise agreement and discussed his plan to garner support for it among both Democrats and Republicans. He also reaffirmed his commitment to fight for the passage of the Bipartisan Agreement. Additionally, the President emphasized his support for both the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill and a reconciliation bill that includes the American Families Plan. These two priorities are crucial to the President, and he wants to see them move forward quickly through the legislative process and be presented to him for signing as soon as possible. The President eagerly anticipates signing both of these bills.
