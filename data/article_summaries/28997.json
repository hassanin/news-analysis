In this article, it is announced that March 2019 is recognized as American Red Cross Month. The American Red Cross was founded by Clara Barton in 1881 as a charitable organization to help those in need. The organization provides services such as disaster relief, blood donations, and support for military families. Last year, the American Red Cross responded to natural disasters both in the United States and internationally, providing shelter, meals, and emergency supplies. The organization is also the largest supplier of blood products in the country, helping accident victims, patients undergoing medical treatments, and those affected by tragic events. Furthermore, the American Red Cross supports military personnel and veterans by providing emergency communication services and healthcare support. President Donald Trump acknowledges the importance of the American Red Cross and encourages Americans to support its mission.
