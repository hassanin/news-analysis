President Trump held a press briefing where he discussed the progress made in the fight against COVID-19 and outlined guidelines for reopening the country. He emphasized that the goal is to balance the health of the American people with the health and functioning of the economy. The guidelines consist of three phases, with each phase allowing for a gradual reopening of different sectors of society. The decision of when to move to each phase will be up to individual governors based on the conditions in their states. Trump also mentioned that some states, such as Montana, Wyoming, Hawaii, and Idaho, have already met the criteria for reopening and could start the process soon. He expressed hope that the country will be able to handle any potential resurgence of the virus in the fall and stated that the government will continue to expand testing capacity and provide support to states. He also mentioned the need to replenish the funds for small business loans and expressed optimism that an agreement will be reached soon.
