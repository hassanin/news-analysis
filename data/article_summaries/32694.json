President Donald J. Trump has directed Federal agencies to develop a national strategy to map the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and a strategy to map the Alaskan coastline. This is aimed at advancing our understanding of our oceans and coastlines. The President is also promoting efficient permitting for ocean exploration, mapping, and research activities, in order to streamline the process. These actions are expected to benefit the U.S. economy, national security, and environment.
