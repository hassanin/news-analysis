President Donald J. Trump has signed Executive Grants of Clemency to commute the sentences of five individuals: Lenora Logan, Rashella Reed, Charles Tanner, John Bolen, and Curtis McDonald. Lenora Logan, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison for her involvement in a cocaine conspiracy, turned her life around while incarcerated. She intervened to protect a nurse from an assault, served as a suicide watch companion and nursing assistant, and was a leader in the prison's praise and worship team. Rashella Reed, a former Atlanta Public School teacher, was sentenced to 14 years for wire fraud and money laundering. While in prison, she used her teaching background to tutor inmates and facilitate children's programs. Charles Tanner, a young professional boxer, was initially sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in a drug conspiracy, which was later reduced to 30 years. He has completed numerous educational programs and expresses remorse for his past actions. John Bolen, a small business owner, was sentenced to life imprisonment for transporting cocaine. He has no history of violence and has completed over 1,300 hours of educational programming and vocational training. Curtis McDonald, convicted of drug trafficking and money laundering, has served nearly 24 years of a life sentence. He has maintained employment and completed numerous education courses while in prison. Despite their past actions, these individuals have shown remorse, made positive changes in their lives, and have been determined to help others. As a result, the President believes they are deserving of clemency.
