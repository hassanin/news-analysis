President Obama announced several steps to increase support for emerging entrepreneurs during an event at the White House. The President made investing in women and youth entrepreneurs the top priority for his Administration's global entrepreneurship programs. He also issued a call to action, challenging companies, organizations, and individuals to increase their investments in global emerging entrepreneurs. Additionally, nine new Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship were announced, and the creation of the Spark Global Entrepreneurship coalition was recognized. The United States is making empowering women and youth a central objective of its global entrepreneurship programs, aiming to generate over a billion dollars in private investment for emerging entrepreneurs by the end of 2017, with half of this goal specifically for women and young entrepreneurs. The President also called for increased support for emerging entrepreneurs, especially women and youth, and two Spark Global Entrepreneurship events will take place on the road to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Nairobi. The Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship (PAGE) program, established by President Obama in 2014, will employ the skills, networks, and resources of top American entrepreneurs to develop the next generation of entrepreneurs. Finally, the Spark Global Entrepreneurship Coalition was formed to connect, coordinate, and create common goals across public, private, and non-profit sector efforts to advance entrepreneurship around the world.
