The United States welcomes the Paraguayan Embassy's move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and thanks them for recognizing Israel's capital. The US encourages other countries to do the same. President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and open an embassy there follows in the footsteps of President Truman's recognition of the State of Israel 70 years ago. The US hopes that more countries will follow suit and open their embassies in Jerusalem.
