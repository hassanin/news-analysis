The White House Press Secretary released a statement praising the New Hampshire House of Representatives for passing Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. The statement emphasizes that this decision is about providing access to quality, affordable healthcare for all Americans, and not about politics. It states that 26,000 residents who would otherwise be uninsured will now have access to affordable coverage, and hospitals and businesses in New Hampshire will save on uncompensated care costs. The statement also mentions that New Hampshire is joining other states in expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and expresses anticipation for Governor Hassan to sign this legislation into law.
