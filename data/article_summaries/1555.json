In a press briefing before leaving for California, President Biden addressed the recent troubles faced by Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. He assured Americans that their deposits are safe and that small businesses will be able to pay their workers and bills. The government regulator, the FDIC, has taken control of the assets of both banks, and Treasury Secretary Yellen and banking regulators have taken immediate action to protect customers' deposits. No losses will be borne by taxpayers, and the money will come from the fees that banks pay into the Deposit Insurance Fund. The management of these banks will be fired, and investors will not be protected as they knowingly took a risk. The President emphasized the need to hold those responsible accountable and to reduce the risks of this happening again. He mentioned the importance of strengthening banking rules and regulations to protect American jobs and small businesses. The President concluded by highlighting the progress made in the economy, with the creation of over 12 million new jobs and record numbers of people starting new businesses. He expressed the commitment of his administration to continue protecting depositors and the banking system.
