The Trump administration, with the support of the international community, is applying diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea to achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the dismantling of the regime's ballistic-missile programs. The administration is replacing the failed policy of "strategic patience" with a new policy of strategic accountability. The US alliances with South Korea and Japan are strong, and military options are backed by diplomacy. The US will continue to work with allies and partners to deepen diplomatic and military cooperation, enforce sanctions, and hold nations accountable to their commitments to isolate the North Korean regime. The US is prepared to defend its homeland, citizens, and allies, and any attack or use of nuclear weapons will be met with an effective and overwhelming response. North Korea now faces a choice between peace, prosperity, and international acceptance or further belligerence, poverty, and isolation.
