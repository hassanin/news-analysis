The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been reauthorized for the first time by the House of Representatives. The authorization act ensures that DHS, along with its employees and contractors, have the necessary tools to carry out their mission of protecting the country from evolving security challenges. The act also authorizes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the first time, reflecting the President's commitment to ending illegal immigration and enforcing U.S. laws. The President commends the House's vote and urges the Senate to take up the legislation without delay.
