On United Nations Day, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation recognizing the contributions of the United Nations to peace and security among nations. The proclamation emphasizes the need for member states to reaffirm their commitments to the obligations and responsibilities outlined in the United Nations Charter, particularly in addressing transnational threats such as terrorism, mass atrocities, famine, humanitarian crises, and nuclear proliferation. The United States has led efforts at the United Nations to strengthen sanctions against North Korea, review peacekeeping missions, and promote reform, including with respect to the United Nations Human Rights Council. The proclamation expresses hope that the United Nations can achieve its goals of maintaining international peace and security and developing friendly relations among nations. It also acknowledges the men and women serving in peacekeeping missions, providing humanitarian assistance, and working to keep the world safe from weapons of mass destruction. President Trump proclaims October 24, 2017, as United Nations Day and urges all officials and governors to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
