President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Florida due to the effects of Hurricane Michael. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to affected individuals and communities. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. The designated counties eligible for this assistance are Bay, Franklin, Gulf, Taylor, and Wakulla. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures in several other counties. Thomas J. McCool has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
