In this press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney discusses the declining healthcare costs in America and the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). He states that the ACA has helped to slow down the trend of increasing healthcare costs and that new data shows a decline in healthcare spending as a share of the economy. Carney also discusses the ongoing debate in Congress regarding the extension of unemployment benefits. He argues that it is an emergency situation for 1.3 million Americans and their families who had their benefits cut off, and calls on Congress to pass a bipartisan bill that extends emergency insurance to the unemployed for three months. Carney expresses hope for bipartisan action and emphasizes the positive impact of extending these benefits on the economy. He also addresses other topics such as immigration reform, Dennis Rodman's trip to North Korea, and the President's views on same-sex marriage.
