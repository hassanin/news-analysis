The article discusses the benefits of extending unemployment insurance in the United States. It highlights the importance of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program, which has provided support to millions of workers and their families since its inception in 2008. The report argues that allowing the EUC program to expire would be harmful to workers and the economy. It states that millions of workers would lose access to UI benefits, potentially leading to a reduction in demand and job losses. The article also mentions that the expiration of extended UI benefits may discourage some long-term unemployed individuals from actively seeking work. Furthermore, it highlights that the current unemployment rate and long-term unemployment rate are higher than they were at the expiration of previous extended UI benefits programs. The article concludes by emphasizing the gradual phasing down of the EUC program and the proposed extension.
