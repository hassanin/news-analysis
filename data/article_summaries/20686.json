The article discusses a joint statement by several countries affirming their support for Indonesia's initiative to create a National Legislation Implementation Kit on Nuclear Security. This kit aims to assist countries in developing comprehensive national legislation on nuclear security, tailored to their own legal processes. It will provide references to various elements and provisions from different nuclear security conventions and treaties, as well as international legal instruments and frameworks. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will coordinate the task of creating this reference kit in collaboration with other relevant international organizations. The countries supporting this initiative will continue to support and encourage the IAEA and other organizations to explore concrete ways to develop the kit after the 2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit.
