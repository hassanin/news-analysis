President Donald J. Trump has granted a Full Pardon to Lord Conrad M. Black of Crossharbour. Lord Black was previously accused of mail fraud and obstruction in 2007, but the Supreme Court overturned most of the charges. Despite this, Lord Black spent 3.5 years in prison. He is an entrepreneur and scholar who has made significant contributions to business, politics, and historical thought. He was the owner of one of the world's largest newspapers and has written notable biographies and works of history. Lord Black's case has received support from high-profile individuals such as Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, Sir Elton John, and Rush Limbaugh. During his time in prison, Lord Black served as a tutor for 150 students. Considering these achievements and his character, Mr. Black is seen as deserving of this grant of clemency.
