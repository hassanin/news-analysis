President Donald Trump is taking action to combat the drug addiction crisis in America. In 2016, there were nearly 64,000 drug overdose deaths, with opioids being a major contributor. Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum in October 2017, directing executive departments and agencies to combat the drug demand and opioid crisis. The Trump Administration's response can be categorized into three areas: demand reduction, supply crackdown, and expanding access to treatment. The administration is promoting prevention efforts, enhancing overdose tracking, and encouraging safer prescribing practices. They are also cracking down on criminal websites selling opioids, fraudulent prescribers, and the production and sale of illicit fentanyl. Additionally, they are supporting state and industry innovation to increase access to treatment and recovery services. Trump's personal experience with addiction in his family drives his commitment to addressing the issue and preventing future cases. The administration aims to liberate communities from the scourge of drug addiction.
