Retailers have been moving a record number of goods into the country with the help of various workers in the transportation supply chain. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have seen a 17% increase in container movement compared to 2018, setting a new record. This increased throughput has presented challenges for importers, exporters, and farmers. To address these challenges, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, along with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) workers, have committed to shifting towards 24/7 operations to boost efficiency. Major companies have also joined in, committing to move more containers during off-peak hours. The major railroads responsible for moving goods out of the ports, BNSF and Union Pacific, have announced discounts for customers and extended their operating hours. Additionally, Port Envoy Porcari has been leading regular meetings with stakeholders to identify and address operational problems. These efforts have started to show positive results in improving the efficiency of the goods movement system. However, it is important to note that the system has been underinvested in for decades. The recent passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, which includes $17 billion for ports, is a significant step towards improving efficiency, reducing costs, and decreasing emissions in the movement of goods. Furthermore, a $5 billion agreement between the U.S. Department of Transportation and the state of California will support port and inland improvements. These investments are expected to create jobs and strengthen U.S. competitiveness, making supply chains more resilient in the face of future shocks.
