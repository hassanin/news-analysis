This article is a memorandum from the White House regarding the imports of certain passenger vehicle and light truck tires from China. The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) determined that these imports are causing market disruption to domestic producers. As a result, the President has issued a proclamation to impose additional duties on these imports for a period of three years. The additional duty rates will be 35% ad valorem in the first year, 30% ad valorem in the second year, and 25% ad valorem in the third year. The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor have been directed to expedite consideration of Trade Adjustment Assistance applications and provide assistance to affected workers, firms, and communities. The United States Trade Representative will publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
