In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims November 9, 2013, as World Freedom Day. He reflects on the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the transition from division to reunification. He emphasizes that it is ultimately citizens who have the power to decide whether to be defined by walls or to tear them down. The United States stood alongside those who fought for their basic liberties and the nations that reclaimed their right to determine their own course. The alliances formed during this time are seen as the foundation of global security and the engine of the global economy. The fight for human dignity continues, and the United States remains committed to supporting those who strive for freedom. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to observe World Freedom Day and reaffirm their dedication to freedom and democracy.
