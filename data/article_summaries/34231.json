The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has released new data showing that the United States added 250,000 jobs in October, surpassing expectations by 50,000 jobs. This marks the longest streak of positive monthly job numbers in the country's history. The economy has added 4.5 million jobs since President Trump's election in November 2016. Additionally, wages are on the rise, with average hourly earnings increasing by 3.1 percent over the past year. This is the first time since 2009 that the growth in hourly earnings has exceeded 3 percent. Weekly earnings have also increased by 3.4 percent over the past year. Employment gains were seen across all industries, with particularly strong growth in education and health services, leisure and hospitality, manufacturing, construction, and transportation and warehousing. The unemployment rate remains at 3.7 percent, the lowest it has been in almost 50 years. The rate for Hispanics is the lowest since 1973, and the rate for individuals with some college or an associate degree is the lowest since 2001. The labor force participation rate for prime-age workers has increased, with more people re-entering the job market. The employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers has also increased. Overall, the report indicates continued progress in the economy under the Trump Administration, with more people entering the labor force, strong hiring rates, and increasing wages.
