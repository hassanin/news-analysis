President Barack Obama has sent a message to Congress regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to North Korea. He states that the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, as well as the actions and policies of the North Korean government that destabilize the region and endanger US Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners, still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain the measures taken to address this threat.
