Vice President Mike Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso have launched the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue in Tokyo, Japan. This dialogue was agreed upon by President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in February as a way to strengthen economic ties between the two countries. The dialogue will focus on three policy pillars: common strategy on trade and investment rules/issues, cooperation in economic and structural policies, and sectoral cooperation. The goal is to achieve concrete results in the near future. The Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister plan to continue engaging in the dialogue by the end of the year. The dialogue will cover various aspects such as trade and investment standards, regional and global trade initiatives, addressing third-country concerns, cooperation on fiscal, monetary, and structural policies, global economic and financial developments, regional macroeconomic and financial issues, and specific sectors that can promote mutual economic benefits and job creation in both countries.
