The Biden Administration has formed two Unified Coordination Groups (UCGs) to respond to the SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange incidents. These UCGs have been successful in patching vulnerabilities and reducing the number of victims. As a result, the UCG surge efforts are being stood down and future responses will be handled through standard incident management procedures. The Biden Administration aims to use the innovations and lessons learned from these incidents to improve future unified responses to significant cyber incidents. They are working with Congress, the private sector, and international partners to enhance the nation's cyber defenses and response capabilities. The Administration emphasizes the priority placed on cybersecurity and improving incident response for both the government and private sector.
