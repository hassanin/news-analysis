Deputy National Security Advisors Anne Neuberger and Daleep Singh held a press briefing to discuss the ongoing situation between Russia and Ukraine. Neuberger discussed Russia's history of using cyberattacks as part of its military activity and outlined the three ways the US has been preparing for potential cyberattacks: shoring up cyber defenses at home, providing support to Ukraine, and working with allies to defend against cyber threats. Singh discussed the potential economic sanctions that the US and its allies could impose on Russia if it invades Ukraine, emphasizing the economic impact it would have on Russia. The briefing also touched on the possibility of a meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the President's upcoming virtual G7 leaders meeting, and other topics such as supply chain reshoring and the Supreme Court nomination process.
