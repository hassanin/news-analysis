The memorandum issued by President Joe Biden emphasizes the importance of tribal consultation and strengthening nation-to-nation relationships with American Indian and Alaska Native Tribal Nations. It acknowledges that Tribal Nations are sovereign governments recognized under the Constitution, treaties, statutes, Executive Orders, and court decisions. The memorandum directs all executive departments and agencies to engage in regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal officials in the development of Federal policies that have Tribal implications. Each agency is required to submit a detailed plan of action to implement the policies and directives of Executive Order 13175 within 90 days. The plan should be developed after consultation with Tribal Nations and officials. The memorandum also outlines reporting requirements and establishes a review process to ensure consistency with the policies of Executive Order 13175. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is directed to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
