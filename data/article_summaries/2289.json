The United States strongly condemns the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea (DPRK) for its recent failed missile launch, which violates UN Security Council resolutions and raises tensions in the region. The launch involved technology related to the DPRK's intercontinental ballistic missile program. The President's national security team is assessing the situation and working closely with allies. The US urges all countries to condemn the launch and calls on the DPRK to engage in serious negotiations. While diplomacy is still an option, Pyongyang must stop its provocative actions and choose engagement. The US will take necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and defend its allies in South Korea and Japan.
