President Joe Biden has issued an order to establish the Climate Change Support Office (CCSO) within the Department of State. The CCSO's purpose is to support bilateral and multilateral engagement in addressing the global climate crisis, in coordination with other executive departments and agencies. The CCSO will assist in leading diplomatic engagement on climate change, increasing international climate ambition, and integrating climate change into all elements of US foreign policy-making decision processes. It will also support efforts beyond the Department of State's current climate work in areas such as clean energy, aviation, shipping, the Arctic, the ocean, sustainable development, and migration. The CCSO will be headed by a Director selected by the Secretary of State and will terminate at the end of the maximum permitted period unless terminated sooner by the Secretary. The order does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It will be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
