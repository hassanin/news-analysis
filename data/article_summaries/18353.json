This article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued by Barack Obama in 2011 regarding regulatory flexibility, small businesses, and job creation. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of small businesses in the American economy and their role in fueling productivity, economic growth, and job creation. It highlights the challenges faced by small businesses during the recession, including job losses. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) is mentioned, which aims to achieve statutory goals without imposing unnecessary burdens on the public. The RFA requires agencies to produce regulatory flexibility analyses that consider the effects of regulations on small businesses and explore alternatives to minimize economic impact. The RFA also encourages public participation and transparency in the rulemaking process. The memorandum directs executive departments and agencies to consider reducing regulatory burdens on small businesses when initiating rulemaking with a significant economic impact. It suggests various forms of flexibility, such as extended compliance dates, performance standards, simplification of reporting requirements, and exemptions. Agencies are urged to justify their decision if they choose not to provide flexibility. The memorandum aims to ensure that regulatory actions do not impose unjustified economic burdens on small businesses. It concludes by stating that it does not create any enforceable rights or affect the functions of the Office of Management and Budget.
