In a meeting with members of the House and Senate, President Biden expressed his desire to preside over the end of cancer. He acknowledged the critical role that these lawmakers played in the CARES Act, which allocated $9 billion to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for cancer research. The President and Vice President believe that by taking a different approach, significant progress can be made in fighting cancer, Alzheimer's, and other diseases. Cancer is a personal and devastating word for many people, and the President emphasized the importance of legislative and substantive actions to make progress in this area. 

Regarding recent events, President Biden mentioned that U.S. troops were targeted with rocket attacks. While no one was killed by the rockets, one contractor died of a heart attack. The responsible party is being identified, and judgments will be made accordingly. 

When asked about Texas relaxing its COVID restrictions, the President stated that he believes it's a big mistake. He emphasized the importance of masks, as they make a difference in controlling the spread of the virus. The administration aims to have enough vaccines for every adult American by the end of May, but until then, it is crucial to follow safety measures such as wearing masks, washing hands frequently, and practicing social distancing. The President expressed frustration that not all elected officials seem to understand the importance of these measures.
