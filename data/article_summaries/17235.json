The Obama Administration has announced the final round of nine new Promise Zone designations, which aim to expand access to opportunity in urban, rural, and tribal communities. The Promise Zone initiative pairs federal government partners with local leaders to streamline resources and deliver comprehensive support. The designations include Nashville, TN; South Los Angeles, CA; Atlanta, GA; Evansville, IN; San Diego, CA; Spokane Tribe of Indians, WA; Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, ND; Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council; and Puerto Ricoâ€™s Ceiba, Fajardo, and Naguado Municipalities. These Promise Zones will receive federal support to implement their goals, such as preferred access to certain competitive federal investments, federal staff on the ground, and AmeriCorps VISTA members to strengthen capacity. The Promise Zone initiative has shown progress in existing zones, such as job creation, improved educational outcomes, and crime reduction.
