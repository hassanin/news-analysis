President Donald Trump has issued a notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 with respect to Yemen is to continue beyond May 16, 2018. This decision is based on the ongoing threats to Yemen's peace, security, and stability caused by certain former members of the Yemeni government and others who obstruct the political process and the implementation of the November 23, 2011 agreement for a peaceful transition of power. President Trump has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency in order to address these challenges.
