On June 6, 2018, President Donald Trump signed into law the VA MISSION Act of 2018, also known as S. 2372. However, the President issued a statement regarding certain provisions in the Act. 

Firstly, Section 152(a) of the Act states that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs must obtain approval from the chairmen of two congressional committees before spending over $50 million on certain pilot programs. The President argues that this provision violates the separation of powers and directs the Secretary to treat it as advisory and non-binding.

Secondly, Section 202(c)(2) requires the President to consult with members of Congress on the appointment of members to the Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission. The President disagrees with this requirement, stating that it violates the separation of powers, and intends to treat it as hortatory but not mandatory.

Lastly, Sections 203(b)(6), (c)(4), and 202(h)(5) state that the Commission must make all information used in developing its recommendations available to Congress and the Comptroller General. The President asserts his constitutional authority to withhold information that could impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the executive branch, or the performance of his constitutional duties, and will treat these provisions accordingly.
