First Lady Melania Trump has issued a public service announcement in coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) asking Americans to support disaster survivors following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. The severity and impact of these storms in various states and territories will require the combined efforts of federal, state, tribal, territorial, and local agencies, as well as non-profit, voluntary, faith-based, and private sector organizations. Mrs. Trump expressed her thoughts and prayers for the affected families and stated her commitment to helping those in need. The public service announcement encourages viewers to donate to an organization of their choice and volunteer to assist fellow Americans. More information can be found on NVOAD.org and Ready.gov.
