The United States and Brazil have announced a joint global initiative to prioritize workers' rights and promote decent work. They believe that working people are essential to building a sustainable and equitable world. The initiative aims to address five urgent challenges facing workers globally: protecting workers' rights, promoting safe and healthy work environments, advancing worker-centered approaches to clean energy, harnessing technology for the benefit of all, and tackling workplace discrimination. The two countries will work together with their union partners and engage with other countries and international organizations to address these issues. They hope that other partners and allies will join their efforts in creating a sustainable economy that respects workers' dignity and rights.
