In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims October 2010 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. He highlights the progress made in reducing domestic violence since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, but acknowledges that it remains a public health crisis. The Obama administration has taken steps to address domestic violence, such as appointing a White House Advisor on Violence Against Women and passing the Affordable Care Act, which prevents insurance companies from classifying domestic violence as a pre-existing condition. The President also signed the Tribal Law and Order Act to combat domestic violence and sexual assault in tribal areas. Additionally, the administration has launched initiatives to support children exposed to domestic violence. President Obama calls for a collaborative effort from all sectors of society to end domestic violence, including law enforcement, justice systems, businesses, faith leaders, educators, and healthcare providers. He encourages victims and concerned citizens to seek help from the National Domestic Violence Hotline. The President urges Americans to be vigilant in recognizing and combating domestic violence and to create a culture of safety and support for all those affected.
