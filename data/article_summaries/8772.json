President Biden stated during a press briefing that he has not yet invited President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir Putin of Russia to the upcoming climate summit. However, he mentioned that they are aware of the invitation. The President also mentioned that he recently spoke with the British Prime Minister and members of the European Union, but has not individually spoken with Xi or Putin. When asked about the new Georgia election law, President Biden criticized it, calling it an "atrocity." He specifically mentioned that the provision of the law that prohibits providing water to people waiting in line to vote is a clear indication that the law is designed to restrict voting rights.
