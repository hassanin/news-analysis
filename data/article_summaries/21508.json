On October 12, 2016, President Barack Obama ordered missile strikes on radar facilities in Yemen controlled by Houthi insurgents. These strikes were in response to anti-ship cruise missile launches by the insurgents that posed a threat to US Navy warships in the Red Sea. The radar facilities targeted had been involved in the previous attacks. The strikes were conducted to protect US personnel and ships and maintain freedom of navigation in the area. President Obama directed these strikes using his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. He provided this report to Congress in accordance with the War Powers Resolution.
