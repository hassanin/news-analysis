The United States is commemorating the victims of the Holodomor, a man-made tragedy in Ukraine, in which over three million people died due to the policies of Joseph Stalin. The Soviet Union deliberately seized Ukrainian land and crops, causing widespread starvation. Despite the hardships, the Ukrainian people have shown resilience and continued their struggle for peace, freedom, and democracy. The United States stands with Ukraine in defending these values. The Ukrainian-American community and friends of Ukraine are working to ensure that the memory of those who suffered during the Holodomor lives on as they strive to create a better world.
