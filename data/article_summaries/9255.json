In a speech delivered in the State Dining Room, President Biden highlighted the historic progress made in the country's economic recovery. He noted that the national unemployment rate has fallen below 4 percent, the sharpest one-year drop in unemployment in US history. Additionally, the unemployment rate has been below 4 percent in the first year of a presidential term for the first time in 50 years. The President credited the American Rescue Plan for getting the economy back on track, with over 200 million Americans fully vaccinated and millions of new jobs created since January 2021. He emphasized that the Biden economic plan is working, with record job creation, wage gains, and increases in labor force participation. The President also addressed concerns about inflation and outlined a three-part plan to address cost burdens for families, including fixing the supply chain, protecting consumers and promoting competition, and lowering household costs through the Build Back Better Act. He rejected the idea of making working families poorer to combat high prices and emphasized the need for a more productive economy that benefits everyone. The President expressed confidence that the Federal Reserve will address inflation concerns and stated that the new normal does not have to be living with COVID forever, as there are tools available to contain the virus and its variants.
