President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance in Puerto Rico. The funding is for Public Assistance projects related to the earthquakes that occurred between December 2019 and July 2020. Previously, the federal funding covered 75% of eligible costs, but now it has been increased to 90%. This decision aims to provide additional support to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
