President Joe Biden has announced the revocation of international air travel restrictions that were imposed in October 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision comes as a result of the successful response to the pandemic, including the availability of vaccines, tests, and therapeutics, as well as the lower levels of COVID-19 cases and deaths globally. The President's decision is based on the latest guidance from public health experts and the improved capacity of the healthcare system to handle potential surges in cases. The revocation will take effect on May 12, 2023. Relevant agencies will review and potentially revise or revoke any regulations or policies developed in response to the previous proclamation. The proclamation does not affect the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
