In this article, President Barack Obama has issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Liberians in the United States. Since 1991, the US has provided safe haven for Liberians who fled their country due to armed conflict and civil strife. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was granted to them, but ended in 2007. However, President Bush deferred the enforced departure of Liberians originally granted TPS. President Obama extended this grant of DED until September 30, 2016, and has now determined that there are compelling foreign policy reasons to extend DED for another 18 months. This means that the removal of any Liberian national or person who last habitually resided in Liberia will be deferred for 18 months from October 1, 2016. The grant of DED applies to those who have continuously resided in the US since October 1, 2002, with certain exceptions. The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to implement this deferral and to authorize employment for eligible Liberians for the same period.
