President Joe Biden and his administration are committed to providing relief to borrowers of student loan debt. They aim to help individuals move forward in their lives, whether it be starting a family, buying a home, or becoming an entrepreneur. In a historic move, $39 billion in student loan debt will be forgiven for 804,000 borrowers who have been making payments for 20 years or more and qualify for relief. Many of these borrowers were placed in forbearance by loan servicers in violation of the rules, or did not receive appropriate credit for their monthly payments. The reduction of student loan debt and addressing harmful practices has been a priority throughout the career of California Attorney General, who has previously won $1 billion for defrauded veterans and students by taking on predatory for-profit colleges. President Biden recently announced an alternative path to provide relief through the Higher Education Act, and a new income-driven repayment plan has been finalized, cutting monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans. The administration will continue to advocate for accessible postsecondary education without burdensome student loan debt.
