President Trump issued remarks in the Rose Garden on July 11, 2019, regarding the citizenship question on the 2020 Census. He emphasized the importance of knowing the number of citizens and non-citizens in the United States and how it affects public policy, healthcare, education, civil rights, and immigration. The President mentioned that the Department of Commerce initially decided to include the citizenship question, but it was delayed due to litigation. He criticized far-left Democrats for trying to conceal the number of illegal aliens in the country and accused them of eroding the rights of American citizens. The President stated that he will issue an executive order requiring all federal agencies to provide the Department of Commerce with records on citizens and non-citizens. He believes that this information, combined with the census questionnaire, will yield an accurate count of citizens, non-citizens, and illegal aliens in the United States. Attorney General Bill Barr also spoke, expressing support for the President's decision and highlighting the government's right to inquire about citizenship status on the census. He acknowledged that adding the citizenship question to the 2020 Census is not currently feasible due to ongoing litigation and existing injunctions. However, he commended the President for finding alternative ways to obtain vital information on citizenship.
