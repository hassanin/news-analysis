President Obama released a statement expressing his deep sadness over the passing of Vaclav Havel. He described Havel as a playwright and prisoner of conscience who became the President of Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic. Havel lived with a spirit of hope and his peaceful resistance shook the foundations of an empire, exposing the emptiness of a repressive ideology. He played a crucial role in the Velvet Revolution that won freedom for his people and inspired others around the world. Havel also symbolized the aspirations of a continent cut off by the Iron Curtain and helped bring about a united and democratic Europe. President Obama was personally inspired by Havel's words and leadership and expressed his condolences to Havel's family and all those who remain inspired by him. Havel was a friend to America and to all who strive for freedom and dignity.
