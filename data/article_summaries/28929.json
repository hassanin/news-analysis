Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has won the presidential election of his Liberal Democratic Party in Japan and subsequently been elected as Prime Minister by the Japanese Diet. The United States congratulates Suga and expresses readiness to continue pursuing the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, as established by President Donald Trump and former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The US-Japan Alliance is expected to be further strengthened under Suga's leadership, with both countries working together to achieve shared goals.
