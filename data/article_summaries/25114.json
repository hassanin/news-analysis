President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring October 14-20, 2018, as National Minority Enterprise Development Week. In the proclamation, he highlights the success of minority-owned businesses and their contributions to the US economy, employing eight million people and generating over $1 trillion in economic output annually. The Trump administration aims to empower minority business owners by creating a favorable business environment through the elimination of unnecessary regulations and the implementation of pro-growth policies. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which included the Opportunity Zones Program, is mentioned as a means to incentivize businesses to invest in distressed communities and create jobs. The administration also emphasizes efforts to renegotiate and modernize trade agreements to level the playing field for American businesses. The proclamation notes that these policies have resulted in positive outcomes, such as the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years and record-low unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans. The Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency is expanding its focus to include policy analysis, while the National Council for the American Worker is developing a National Workforce Strategy to address the needs of students, workers, and businesses in a tight labor market. The proclamation concludes by calling on all Americans to celebrate National Minority Enterprise Development Week and recognize the contributions of minority business enterprises.
