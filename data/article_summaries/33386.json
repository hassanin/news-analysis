President Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to foreign interference in United States elections will continue beyond September 12, 2020. The President cited the vulnerability of the US political system to exploitation by foreign powers, particularly through the use of digital devices and internet-based communications. While there has been no evidence of a foreign power altering election outcomes or vote tabulation, the ability of individuals outside the US to interfere in elections and undermine public confidence through unauthorized access to election infrastructure and the distribution of propaganda and disinformation remains a significant threat to national security and foreign policy. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13848.
