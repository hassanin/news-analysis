This memorandum, issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., establishes the policy and approach for executing the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII). The memorandum emphasizes the importance of infrastructure in driving productivity and prosperity, both domestically and internationally. It acknowledges the underfunding of infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries and the need for high-quality financing and technical support. The memorandum highlights four key priorities for infrastructure development: climate and energy security, digital connectivity, health and health security, and gender equality and equity. It calls for a whole-of-government approach and coordination with like-minded partners to meet the infrastructure needs of low- and middle-income countries. The memorandum outlines specific actions and responsibilities for various agencies to support the PGII, prioritize key sectors, and promote competitiveness, private investment, and high standards for infrastructure investments. It also includes provisions for monitoring progress and aligning with broader national security and economic objectives.
