Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Alabama and has ordered Federal assistance to aid in the recovery efforts from Hurricane Michael, which occurred from October 10 to October 13, 2018. The Federal funding will be available to State and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive Federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Gerard M. Stolar has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
