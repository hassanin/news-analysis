On March 15, 2019, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to address the national emergency concerning transnational criminal organizations. The order amends a previous executive order to define "significant transnational criminal organization" as a group that includes foreign persons, engages in serious criminal activity across at least two foreign states or one foreign state and the United States, and poses a threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States. The order does not affect the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and it must be implemented in accordance with applicable law and appropriations. It also does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other entity.
