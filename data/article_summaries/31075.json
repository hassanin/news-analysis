On December 30, 2019, the President signed three bills into law. The first is H.R. 150, also known as the GREAT Act, which requires the Office of Management and Budget to establish government-wide data standards for information reported by grant recipients. The second is H.R. 777, the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2019, which authorizes appropriations to the Department of Justice for various programs related to DNA backlog, training, and sexual assault forensic exams. The third is S. 151, the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act, which gives the Federal Communications Commission authority to issue civil penalties on individuals who violate restrictions on robocalls and requires voice service providers to offer call authentication technologies to consumers.
