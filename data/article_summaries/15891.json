More than 100 colleges and universities have joined the Joining Forces commitment called "Operation Educate the Educators," which aims to prepare educators to support the unique challenges faced by military children. The initiative, started by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden, seeks to ensure that veterans and military families receive recognition and support. Military children often face multiple school transitions, leaving friends behind and adjusting to new environments, which can impact their academic success. The participating institutions have agreed to implement guiding principles in their preparation programs and partner with Pre-K-12 schools to meet the needs of military-connected children. This milestone was announced at George Mason University, one of the participating institutions. The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) and the Military Child Education Coalition (MCEC) are partnering with Dr. Jill Biden and the White House to expand this valuable initiative.
