President Biden has taken action against criminals involved in COVID-19 relief program fraud, with the Department of Justice announcing charges against over 300 additional defendants for alleged COVID-19 fraud amounting to $836 million. The Justice Department has recovered over $1.4 billion and charged more than 3,000 defendants in total. The President has called for the creation of additional anti-fraud strike forces and for Congress to triple the existing strike forces, invest more in fraud prevention efforts, and double the statute of limitations on these crimes.
