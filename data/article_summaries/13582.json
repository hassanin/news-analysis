The United States and the Russian Federation have reached a common understanding on a framework for the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on Prisoners of War and Missing in Action (POW/MIAs). The Commission serves as a forum for both nations to determine the fates of their missing servicemen. The U.S. side of the Commission is chaired by General Robert H. "Doc" Foglesong and includes various members such as Senators Saxby Chambliss and John F. Kerry. The Russian side is comprised of senior officials from various ministries and agencies. The Commission will pursue its goals through four working groups, focusing on personnel from different wars and conflicts.
