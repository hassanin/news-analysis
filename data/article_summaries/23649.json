The United States strongly condemns the targeted killings of civilians, including women and children, in Al-Qubeir, Syria. The Syrian regime's refusal to allow UN observers into the area to verify these reports is seen as an affront to human dignity and justice. The US believes there is no justification for the regime's defiance of its obligations under the Annan Plan, and President Assad's abdication of responsibility for these acts undermines the legitimacy of his rule. The future of Syria should be determined by the Syrian people, and the international community is urged to abandon support for the Assad regime and work towards a political transition that upholds the aspirations of the Syrian people.
