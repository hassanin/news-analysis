The article discusses the announcement made by President Obama and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan regarding a national competition called "Race to the Top." This competition will provide $4.35 billion in grants to states that are leading the way in education reform. The funds will support innovative strategies in four areas: adopting internationally benchmarked standards and assessments, recruiting and retaining effective teachers and principals, building data systems to measure student success, and turning around underperforming schools. In addition to the Race to the Top Fund, the Department of Education plans to award over $5.6 billion in grants through other federal programs that support education reform. These programs include the Investing in Innovation Fund, the Teacher Incentive Fund, the Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems program, Title I School Improvement Grants, and State Educational Technology Grants. The article also mentions that draft guidelines and criteria for the Race to the Top competition and other grants are being published, and applications will be accepted in the coming months.
