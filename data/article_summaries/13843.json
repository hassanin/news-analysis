President Obama hosted the second-ever White House Astronomy Night to inspire more girls and boys with the wonder of science and space. As part of the event, the President announced new private-sector commitments to further his "Educate to Innovate" campaign, which aims to inspire and prepare more students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to excel in STEM fields. The commitments include working with students and citizen scientists to scout targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, supporting more than 500,000 youth in afterschool STEM experiences, creating city and regional "STEM ecosystems," engaging parents in STEM experiences, and providing middle-school students with access to high-quality STEM experiences. The article also highlights other organizations and initiatives that are working to engage students and adults in STEM education and space exploration. NASA's recent discoveries and investments in space technology are also discussed, along with the progress made in the President's outlined space priorities, such as the Journey to Mars and the International Space Station.
