The United States has organized a second flight to deliver aid to Gaza, including 36,000 pounds of food assistance and medical supplies. The aid is being airlifted by the U.S. Air Force and will be transported via ground into Gaza and distributed by U.N. agencies. USAID Administrator Samantha Power is in Egypt to meet with local officials and humanitarian organizations to speed up assistance to Gaza. The U.S. has already provided over $100 million in humanitarian aid, airlifted medical, winter, and food aid, and given half a million pounds of emergency food assistance to those affected by the conflict. The Biden administration is committed to sustaining and expanding the international humanitarian response and rallying the international community to do the same. In other news, President Biden has made history by nominating a historic number of judges, including Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.
