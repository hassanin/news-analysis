The Biden-Harris administration will release the National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan tomorrow. These documents outline the administration's approach to combating pandemics and strengthening biodefense. The National Security Memorandum-15 on Countering Biological Threats will also be signed by the President. The strategy has five goals: detect, prevent, prepare, respond, and recover. It aims to transform the government's ability to prevent, detect, prepare for, respond to, and recover from outbreaks and biological incidents. The strategy also emphasizes the need to strengthen local capacities for pandemic preparedness and improve medical and scientific breakthroughs. The administration has requested $88 billion over five years for pandemic preparedness, and while it has already implemented key actions under baseline budgets, additional resources are needed. The strategy also addresses the need for oversight and regulation of gain-of-function research and biosafety and biosecurity practices. The administration is confident in its ability to secure funding and highlights the importance of investing now to save trillions in the future. The plan also aims to recruit and train a permanent cadre of health workers in all 50 states to support public health emergency preparedness.
