President Obama and his administration are taking action to respond to the severe drought in California. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other federal agencies are providing assistance to farmers, ranchers, small businesses, and communities affected by the drought. Some of the actions being taken include:

- $100 million in livestock disaster assistance for California producers.
- $15 million in targeted conservation assistance for drought-impacted areas.
- $5 million in targeted Emergency Watershed Protection Program assistance to protect vulnerable soils.
- $60 million in funding for food banks in California.
- Establishment of 600 summer meal sites in drought-stricken areas.
- $3 million in grants for rural communities experiencing water shortages.
- Reducing water usage in federal facilities in California.
- Adjusting and speeding changes to key water projects and giving water contractors flexibility.
- Investing in climate resilience with the creation of a $1 billion Climate Resilience Fund.
- Various agencies are also providing real-time weather and hydrologic information, emergency agriculture loans, conservation programs, and resources for upgrading infrastructure.

These actions aim to provide immediate relief and support to those affected by the drought, as well as to build resilience against future droughts and climate change impacts.
