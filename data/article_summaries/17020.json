The Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, Ben Rhodes, held a conference call to discuss the latest assessment of the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The intelligence community has assessed that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons, including sarin nerve gas, on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year. The intelligence community estimates that 100 to 150 people have died from these chemical weapons attacks. The United States believes that the Assad regime maintains control of chemical weapons within Syria, and there is no evidence that the opposition has acquired or used chemical weapons. As a result of this assessment, the President has decided to provide additional support to the Syrian opposition, including direct military support to the Supreme Military Council (SMC). The President has also not ruled out other options, including potential military options and international action. The United States will continue to consult with Congress and the international community on its assessments and policy response. The preferred outcome is a negotiated political settlement that establishes an authority in Syria that can provide stability and administer state institutions, while protecting the rights of all Syrians and securing unconventional and advanced conventional weapons. The United States will also continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the Syrian crisis.
