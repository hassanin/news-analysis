President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress requesting consideration of budget amendments for various departments and agencies for the fiscal year 2016. The amendments, which include departments such as Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security, are fully offset and do not change the overall discretionary budget authority. The amendments aim to accurately reflect the policies assumed in the FY 2016 Budget. Additionally, budget amendments for the Legislative Branch are included, decreasing the overall discretionary budget authority by $2.7 million. The letter also mentions concerns raised by the Inspector General for the Environmental Protection Agency regarding the budget request for the Office of Inspector General. These concerns were not included in the FY 2016 Budget document but are now being transmitted to Congress as required by the Inspector General Act of 1978. The details of the amendments can be found in the enclosure from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
