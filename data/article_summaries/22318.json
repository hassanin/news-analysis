The White House has announced that the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations will continue beyond July 24, 2015. The activities of these organizations pose a significant threat to international political and economic systems. They are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous, infiltrating foreign governments and the international financial system, which weakens democratic institutions, degrades the rule of law, and undermines economic markets. These organizations also facilitate violent conflicts and support other dangerous individuals. Therefore, it has been determined that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 will be extended to address these ongoing threats.
