In this article, it is mentioned that President Obama called Texas Governor Rick Perry to express his concern for the citizens impacted by the fires in Texas. The President extended his condolences for the lives lost and assured the Governor that federal assistance will continue to be available through DHS/FEMA and the U.S. Forest Service. The President also directed his national security staff to work closely with FEMA, the Forest Service, and the State of Texas to ensure that all resources are made available. The Administration has already granted eight Fire Management Assistance Grants at the Governor's request and FEMA is working with state and local officials to assess damage and identify areas where additional federal assistance may be needed.
