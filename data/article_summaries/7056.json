The House Republicans have passed a bill that includes cuts to veterans' health care, education, Meals on Wheels, and public safety. It also takes away health care from millions of Americans and sends manufacturing jobs overseas. Meanwhile, they are fighting to extend the Trump tax cuts for the wealthiest and profitable corporations. President Biden has stated that he will not burden middle-class and working families with tax cuts for the wealthiest, as this bill does. He has made it clear that this bill has no chance of becoming law. It is crucial for Congressional Republicans to act immediately and without conditions to avoid default and ensure the full faith and credit of the United States is not put at risk. Defaulting on our debt could lead to a dangerous financial crisis, a recession, job losses, and harm hard-working Americans' retirement savings. It could also increase long-term federal borrowing costs and add to deficits and debt. As President Reagan said, the United States has a special responsibility to meet its obligations and maintain its reputation for reliability and credibility. Congressional Republicans must act now to avoid default and pay our bills.
