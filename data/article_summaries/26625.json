President Donald Trump has sent a letter to Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, regarding an alternative plan for pay adjustments for civilian federal employees in January 2020. The letter states that current law would result in significant increases in locality pay for federal employees, costing $24 billion in the first year alone. Due to concerns about the fiscal sustainability of these increases, President Trump has decided to exercise his authority to set alternative locality pay adjustments for 2020. While the base pay will increase by 2.6 percent, the locality pay percentages will remain at their 2019 levels. The President emphasizes the need to align the pay system with recruitment and retention goals and to reward employees based on performance. The adjustment will take effect in the first applicable pay period starting on or after January 1, 2020.
