This statement by the White House Press Secretary discusses the Supreme Court case State of Texas v. United States of America, which challenges President Obama's immigration policies. The statement argues that the federal government has the authority to set priorities in enforcing immigration laws, and that the President's actions are consistent with laws passed by Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court. It also highlights the support of top law enforcement officials, state and local leaders, and the economic and safety benefits of these policies. The statement expresses disagreement with the district court's decision to prevent the policies from taking effect and states that the Department of Justice will appeal the decision.
