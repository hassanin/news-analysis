The President's National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) recently held its Quarterly Business Meeting and discussed a forthcoming report to the President. The report identifies barriers to collaboration between critical infrastructure sectors on security and resilience and makes recommendations to address them. The report suggests the need for outcome-based goals and mandatory standards for the security and resilience of critical infrastructure assets. It also emphasizes the inclusion of vulnerable communities in planning and recovery efforts, as well as the importance of targeted drills and exercises to improve incident response. The NIAC is composed of executive leaders from the private sector and government who advise the President on reducing risks and improving the security and resilience of the nation's critical infrastructure.
