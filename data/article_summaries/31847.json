President Trump held a discussion in Mississippi to promote the FIRST STEP Act, a prison reform bill aimed at helping former inmates reenter society as law-abiding citizens. The legislation has bipartisan support and focuses on providing inmates with the skills and resources they need to find employment and stay out of prison upon release. The President and his administration have been working with lawmakers, law enforcement officials, and corrections leaders to address the issue of recidivism and improve the criminal justice system.
