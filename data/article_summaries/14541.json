On April 29, 2011, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order to block the property of certain individuals and entities involved in human rights abuses in Syria. The order expands on previous orders related to the national emergency declared in 2004 and aims to address the threat posed by the Syrian government's actions. The order allows for the blocking of property and interests in property of designated individuals and entities. It also provides criteria for designations, including those involved in human rights abuses, senior officials of blocked entities, those providing support for human rights abuses, and those acting on behalf of blocked persons. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is granted authority to take necessary actions to carry out the order's purposes and to determine when circumstances no longer warrant the blocking of property. All executive agencies are directed to take appropriate measures to implement the provisions of the order.
