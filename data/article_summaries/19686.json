First Lady Michelle Obama is partnering with Epicurious, the U.S. Department of Education, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to host the third annual Healthy Lunchtime Challenge & Kids' "State Dinner." The challenge encourages children and their parents to create and submit original lunch recipes that are healthy, affordable, and tasty. The recipes must adhere to the guidance of USDA's MyPlate to ensure they meet the criteria of a healthy meal. All U.S. states and territories are invited to participate, and the winning recipes will be served at a Kids' "State Dinner" at the White House. The recipes will also be featured in a downloadable e-cookbook. The deadline for recipe submissions is April 5th.
