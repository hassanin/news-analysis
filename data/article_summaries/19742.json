On March 25, 2013, President Barack Obama issued a presidential proclamation establishing the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument. The proclamation highlights the significance of Harriet Tubman as an American hero who fought for the rights of enslaved people, women, and all. The document provides a background on Tubman's life, from being born enslaved in Maryland to escaping to freedom and becoming a prominent "conductor" on the Underground Railroad. It also mentions Tubman's contributions during the Civil War and her establishment of the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged. The proclamation emphasizes the historical importance of the landscape in Dorchester County, Maryland, where Tubman grew up and worked, and its association with the Underground Railroad. The National Park Service, in conjunction with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, will manage the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument. The proclamation calls for the development of a management plan that will preserve the historic and scientific resources, commemorate Tubman's life and work, and interpret the story of the Underground Railroad.
