The White House is hosting a Water Summit to address water challenges in the United States, such as drought, flooding, and water quality issues. The goal is to build a sustainable water future where everyone has access to safe and affordable water. Over 150 external institutions are joining the government in announcing new efforts and commitments to enhance water sustainability. These include private capital investments in water infrastructure projects, research and development into new technologies, a Presidential Memorandum on drought resilience, federal grants for water science, and the release of a new National Water Model. The Administration will continue to take action to protect water resources and build a sustainable future.
