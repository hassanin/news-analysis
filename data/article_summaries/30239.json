The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released its annual estimates on coca cultivation and potential cocaine production in Peru. The report shows that pure potential cocaine production in Peru remains high at 52,100 hectares. The ONDCP supports the Peruvian government's efforts to eradicate coca cultivation in critical growing regions. The report also highlights the increasing number of current cocaine users in the United States, which has risen by 27 percent since 2014. However, there has been a decrease in the number of Americans initiating cocaine use in the past year. Cocaine-involved overdose deaths have also increased by 173 percent between 2014 and 2018.
