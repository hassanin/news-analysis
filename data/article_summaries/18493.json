The article is a letter from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House regarding an alternative plan for pay increases for civilian Federal employees. The plan includes a 2.4 percent across-the-board adjustment in scheduled rates of basic pay and locality pay adjustments averaging 16.5 percent. However, due to national emergency and serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare, President Obama has determined that it is appropriate to implement an alternative plan with an across-the-board increase of 2.0 percent. He believes this decision will not significantly impact the government's ability to recruit and retain well-qualified employees.
