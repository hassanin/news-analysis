President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Texas and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding from April 17-24, 2016. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Fayette, Grimes, Harris, and Parker. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Damage assessments are ongoing in other areas, and more counties and assistance may be designated after the assessments are completed. Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated counties can apply for assistance by registering online or calling the designated phone numbers provided.
