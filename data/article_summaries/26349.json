In a background briefing on President Trump's Cuba policy, senior administration officials discussed the new policy that will be unveiled. The policy aims to reverse the Obama administration's policies towards Cuba and target the repressive members of the Cuban military government. The new policy will empower the Cuban people and not target them directly. It will include measures to restrict the flow of money to the Cuban military, enforce the ban on tourism, and support the Cuban people. The policy will go into effect tomorrow, but the actual impact will occur when the new regulations are promulgated. The briefing also touched on topics such as travel restrictions, diplomatic relations, business opportunities, human rights, and the role of Congress in shaping the policy.
