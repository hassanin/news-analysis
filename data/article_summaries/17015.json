President Obama will be traveling to Germany in late April to participate in the Hannover Messe, the world's largest trade show for industrial technology, and to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel. This will be the first time a sitting U.S. President has participated in the event, providing an opportunity to showcase American innovation and highlight the United States as an attractive investment destination. The President will also address efforts to advance negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. This visit underscores the strong political and economic ties between the U.S. and Germany and emphasizes the importance of trade and investment in driving job creation and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic.
