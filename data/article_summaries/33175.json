The Trump Administration has taken steps to expand health coverage options for individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. Health savings accounts (HSAs) have helped Americans save for medical care, but some patients have been limited by the fact that HSA-eligible plans couldn't cover routine, preventative medicines for chronic conditions before reaching their annual deductible. The Trump Administration has issued guidance that allows HSA-eligible high-deductible healthcare plans to cover preventive medical services or devices like insulin, inhalers, and statins before the deductible. This change is expected to improve access to low-cost healthcare, prevent conditions from worsening, improve treatment quality, and save patients money.
