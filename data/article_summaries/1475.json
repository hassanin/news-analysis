President Biden has authorized additional disaster assistance for Kentucky in response to severe storms, winds, flooding, and tornadoes that occurred in December 2021. The President's order increases federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures to 100% of the eligible costs for a 30-day period. The Commonwealth of Kentucky will have the flexibility to choose a 30-day period within the first 120 days of the declaration to receive this funding.
