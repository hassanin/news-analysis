On March 15, 2022, the President signed three bills into law. The first one is the "Suicide Training and Awareness Nationally Delivered for Universal Prevention Act of 2021" or the "STANDUP Act of 2021." This law prioritizes educational agencies that implement suicide awareness and prevention training policies in certain grant programs. It also provides best practices for such training policies.

The second bill signed into law is the "Supporting the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration Act." This law increases the set-aside for the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration.

The third bill, S. 3706, makes technical amendments to the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000.

The President expressed gratitude to Senators Hassan, Ernst, Lujan, Romney, Collins, Crapo, Risch, Merkley, Wyden, Wicker, Manchin, and Representatives Peters, Bilirakis, Hudson, Eshoo, McMorris Rodgers, and Neguse for their leadership in these efforts.
