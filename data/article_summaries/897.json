On December 20, 2017, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared a national emergency regarding serious human rights abuse and corruption worldwide. This declaration was made in response to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat posed to the United States' national security, foreign policy, and economy. The President states that the prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption originating from outside the United States continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat. As a result, the national emergency declared in 2017 will remain in effect beyond December 20, 2021, for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
