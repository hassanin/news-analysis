President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Securely Expediting Clearances Through Reporting Transparency Act of 2018" or the "SECRET Act of 2018." The Act requires various reports relating to the security clearance and background-investigation processes from executive branch officers. However, the President stresses that the authority to classify information relating to national security and control access to such information lies with the President as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. The Act also requires a review of whether the schedule for processing security clearances should be modified, which will be implemented in line with the President's constitutional authority.
