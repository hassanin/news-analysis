In this memorandum from August 21, 2009, President Barack Obama directs the Secretary of Transportation to provide aviation insurance coverage for commercial air carrier service in domestic and international operations. The President determines that this continuation of U.S. flag commercial air service is necessary for the interest of air commerce, national security, and foreign policy. The Secretary of Transportation is approved to provide insurance or reinsurance to U.S. flag air carriers until August 31, 2010, or until it is determined that such insurance cannot be obtained on reasonable terms and conditions from any U.S. company authorized to conduct an insurance business. The memorandum also instructs the Secretary to bring this determination to the attention of all air carriers and to arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.
