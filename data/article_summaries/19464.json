President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Wisconsin, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding in June 2012. The declaration allows for federal funding to be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The counties of Ashland, Bayfield, and Douglas, as well as the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, are eligible for assistance. Kari Suzann Cowie has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
