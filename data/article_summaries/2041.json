President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has directed the United States Armed Forces to conduct an operation to evacuate U.S. personnel and others from Khartoum, Sudan, due to the deteriorating security situation. U.S. Armed Forces personnel have been deployed to Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Sudan to conduct and support this operation. They will remain in Djibouti to protect U.S. personnel until the security situation no longer requires their presence, and additional forces are prepared to deploy if necessary. President Biden states that this action is consistent with his responsibility to protect U.S. citizens at home and abroad, as well as in line with national security and foreign policy interests. He is providing this report to Congress to keep them fully informed, as required by the War Powers Resolution. President Biden expresses his appreciation for Congress's support in these actions.
