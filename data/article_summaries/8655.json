President Biden spoke before leaving for the G7 summit in Japan. He emphasized the importance of America's role in the world and working together with other countries. He also discussed the status of negotiations with Congressional leaders regarding the budget. He expressed confidence that an agreement will be reached to avoid defaulting on America's debts. The negotiation is focused on the outlines of the budget, not on whether or not debts will be paid. President Biden highlighted the progress his administration has made in reducing the deficit and proposed further reductions in the next decade. He mentioned that senior members from both parties have been designated to negotiate and work out the differences. President Biden stated that he will cut his trip short to be present for the final negotiations and sign the deal. He emphasized that America is not a deadbeat nation and has never defaulted on its debt. He will continue discussions with Congressional leaders in the coming days and plans to hold a press conference on the issue on Sunday. President Biden also mentioned his conversations with the Australian leader and his intention to meet with other leaders at the G7 summit. He clarified that he is unlikely to visit Australia during this trip. When asked about work requirements, President Biden stated that he will not accept any requirements that impact people's medical health needs, but may consider a few others of lesser consequence. He dismissed the idea that putting aside the focus on Asia during this trip is a win for China, as the United States is still meeting with its four good allies. President Biden also mentioned that he intends to speak with President Xi of China, although the timing is not specified.
