On October 27, 2006, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared a national emergency due to the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This was done to address the widespread violence and atrocities that were threatening regional stability and the foreign policy of the United States. The President took further steps to address this emergency in July 2014. The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is still considered an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2006, as amended in 2014, will continue beyond October 27, 2022. This decision is made in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, and the notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
