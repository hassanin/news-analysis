President Barack Obama has announced that Dr. Sally Ride, the first American female astronaut to travel to space, will be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian honor in the United States and is given to individuals who have made significant contributions to the country's security, national interests, world peace, or cultural endeavors. Dr. Ride, who passed away in 2012, was not only a national hero but also a role model for young women, inspiring them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). After leaving NASA, she focused on science education and founded Sally Ride Science, which aimed to provide resources and opportunities for K-12 STEM educators. Dr. Ride was also a strong advocate for gender and racial equality in the classroom and actively worked towards increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The President's decision to award Dr. Ride with the Presidential Medal of Freedom recognizes her contributions to the U.S. space program and education system.
