The Clean Air Act has allowed California to set emissions standards for new vehicles for over 30 years. California has worked with the EPA to reduce air pollution and promote innovation in the automotive industry. Following the 2020 Framework Agreement on Clean Cars, the EPA has established ambitious emissions standards and reinstated the California Waiver. This paves the way for the Biden-Harris Administration and Governor Newsom's leadership in California to create a unified national program that will benefit families throughout the country.
