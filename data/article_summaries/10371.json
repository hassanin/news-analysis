The Department of Labor (DOL) is implementing a new rule to ensure that retirement savers receive investment advice in their best interest. Currently, some financial advisers are incentivized to steer clients into products that may have higher fees and lower returns, costing families an estimated $17 billion a year. The new rule will save affected middle-class families tens of thousands of dollars over a lifetime of savings and level the playing field for retirement advisers. The rule defines fiduciary investment advice and expands the types of retirement advice covered by fiduciary protections. It also includes exemptions that allow advisers and firms to continue receiving common forms of compensation if they put their clients' best interest first. The final rule and exemptions have been revised based on extensive feedback from industry, advocates, Congress, federal and state regulators, and others. The rule and exemptions ensure that advisers are held accountable to their clients and provide options for consumers to hold advisers and firms accountable if they do not act in their clients' best interest. The rule will take effect in April 2017, with full compliance required by January 2018.
