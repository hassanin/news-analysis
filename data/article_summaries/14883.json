The White House has transmitted a proposed agreement between the United States and Australia regarding peaceful uses of nuclear energy to Congress. The agreement, which has been negotiated in accordance with applicable law, aims to promote nuclear nonproliferation and advance the foreign policy interests of the United States. It allows for the transfer of information, material, equipment, and components for nuclear research and power production, but does not permit transfers of Restricted Data or sensitive nuclear technology and facilities. The agreement has an initial term of 30 years, with the possibility of extension unless terminated by either party. Australia is a non-nuclear weapon state party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has safeguards agreements and protocols with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The agreement will undergo review and consultation with relevant congressional committees.
