President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will be hosting President Andrzej Duda and First Lady Agata Kornhauser-Duda of Poland for their first official visit to the White House on September 18, 2018. This visit is significant as Poland celebrates the centennial year of its independence and comes just over a year after President Trump's visit to Warsaw in July 2017. The two presidents will discuss ways to strengthen the strategic partnership between the United States and Poland, with a focus on trade, military, and security matters.
