The Presidential Memorandum issued on June 2, 2020, titled "Providing Continued Federal Support for Governorsâ€™ Use of the National Guard to Respond to COVID-19 and to Facilitate Economic Recovery," emphasizes the need for close cooperation between the federal government and states in combating the spread of COVID-19. The memorandum acknowledges the critical support provided by the National Guard in addressing the needs of vulnerable populations, such as those in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The memorandum extends the 100 percent federal cost share for the use of National Guard forces until August 21, 2020, allowing states to make decisions regarding COVID-19 responses and economic recovery. The memorandum also highlights that it does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies and is subject to applicable law and appropriations.
