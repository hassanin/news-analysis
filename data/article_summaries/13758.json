During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest discussed the review of hostages taken overseas. The review was ordered by President Obama in response to the increase in hostage-takings. Earnest made it clear that the review does not include a reconsideration of the US government's longstanding policy of not paying ransoms to terrorist organizations. The review is ongoing and involves the Department of Defense, State, the FBI, and the intelligence community. Earnest also addressed questions about the President's upcoming announcement on immigration reform. He stated that there is no specific timeline for the announcement and that the President is still considering his options. Earnest also mentioned that if Congress were to pass comprehensive immigration reform, the President would be willing to abandon his executive actions in favor of bipartisan legislation. Other topics discussed during the briefing include the Keystone XL pipeline, the Ebola outbreak, and the situation in Ferguson, Missouri.
