The United States is emphasizing the importance of addressing insider threats in nuclear security. Insiders are defined as individuals with authorized access to nuclear facilities or materials who could attempt unauthorized removal or sabotage, or aid an external adversary in doing so. The US is sponsoring a Gift Basket at the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit to encourage the strengthening of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines and training on this subject. The US has robust insider threat mitigation programs at its nuclear facilities and shares best practices with the IAEA and international partners. Domestically, nuclear facilities have administrative controls, policies, and technical systems in place to minimize the insider threat. Internationally, the US assists partner states in developing and implementing policies and procedures to deter, detect, and mitigate insider threats. As part of the Gift Basket, the US commits to supporting the IAEA's development and implementation of an advanced training course to counter insider threats.
