The United States and the European Union have signed an administrative arrangement to collaborate on research regarding artificial intelligence (AI), computing, and privacy-protecting technologies. This joint effort aims to advance responsible AI development and address global challenges in areas such as extreme weather forecasting, emergency response management, health and medicine improvements, electric grid optimization, and agriculture optimization. The research outcomes are expected to benefit not only the US and EU but also international partners and the global science community. This initiative aligns with the vision outlined in the Declaration for the Future of the Internet (DFI) for an open, free, reliable, and secure Internet and digital technologies worldwide.
