President Biden has announced new actions to address the increase in anti-Asian violence and xenophobia in the United States. These actions include reinstating and expanding the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to combat bias and violence, allocating funding for community-based services for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault from Asian American communities, establishing a COVID-19 Equity Task Force committee to address xenophobia against Asian Americans, and creating a Department of Justice initiative to respond to anti-Asian violence. Additionally, the National Endowment for the Humanities is launching a virtual library to explore Asian American history and address discrimination, while the National Science Foundation is funding research to understand and address bias and xenophobia against Asian American communities. These actions are part of the Biden Administration's commitment to advancing equity for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities.
