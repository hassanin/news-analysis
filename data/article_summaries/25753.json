The Presidential Memoranda issued on April 7, 2020, titled "Providing Federal Support for Governors' Use of the National Guard to Respond to COVID-19," outlines the policy and actions taken by the United States government to assist state governors in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The memorandum emphasizes the need for cooperation between the federal government and the states in addressing the public health risks posed by the virus. It acknowledges the World Health Organization's declaration of the outbreak as a pandemic and the national emergency declared by President Trump. The memorandum directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fund 100% of emergency assistance activities undertaken by the states of Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin, and West Virginia using their National Guard forces. It also instructs the Secretary of Defense to request that the governors of these states order National Guard forces to fulfill mission assignments issued by FEMA on a fully reimbursable basis. The memorandum specifies that the 100% federal cost share for National Guard forces is effective for duty orders of 31 days or fewer, and it includes general provisions regarding implementation, applicable law, and the publication of the memorandum in the Federal Register.
