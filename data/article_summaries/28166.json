The Presidential Memorandum directs action to strengthen protections of United States Government-supported Research and Development (R&D) against foreign government interference and exploitation. It acknowledges that while the United States maintains an open and collaborative environment for research, some foreign governments, including China, do not reciprocate this dedication to open scientific exchange and seek to exploit the United States' research environment. The memorandum outlines various roles and responsibilities for different government agencies, including requiring participants in the R&D enterprise to disclose potential conflicts of interest and commitment, implementing policies to control access to and utilization of government research facilities, and vetting foreign students and researchers. It also emphasizes the importance of information sharing, training for agency personnel, and promoting international cooperation in research security. The memorandum will be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
