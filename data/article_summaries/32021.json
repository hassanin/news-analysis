President Donald J. Trump has announced that he will be donating his second-quarter salary to the Department of Education. The funds will be used to host a STEM-focused camp for students, as part of Trump's efforts to promote interest in science, technology, engineering, and math. This follows previous initiatives such as the INSPIRE Act, which encourages women and girls to pursue careers in aerospace, and the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act, which supports women in the sciences. The Trump Administration has also shown commitment to empowering the American workforce through initiatives like workforce development and apprenticeship programs. Trump has been donating his quarterly salary to various national initiatives since taking office.
