The article discusses why the business community supports the House Republican healthcare plan, known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA). The author, Thomas Donohue, argues that the current healthcare system is failing and in need of reform. He highlights the increasing cost of health insurance and the decrease in private coverage options. Donohue claims that the AHCA will improve access to affordable coverage by repealing Obamacare's tax on health insurance, which drives up premiums. He also mentions that the AHCA will open the door to a wider range of coverage options by removing plan limitations and changing the age-rating rule. Donohue emphasizes that the bill will preserve the employer-sponsored healthcare system, which millions of American workers depend on. He states that the AHCA will contribute to economic growth by eliminating burdensome costs, taxes, and mandates imposed by Obamacare. The bill aims to promote faster, long-term economic growth by repealing a dozen Obamacare tax increases and reducing the overall tax burden by over $900 billion over the next decade.
