During a meeting between President Biden and President Lourenço of Angola, President Biden discussed the recent inflation report, stating that inflation last month was zero, which is helping provide some breathing room for families during the holidays. He also emphasized the importance of the partnership between Angola and the United States, particularly through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. President Biden highlighted the Lobito economic corridor project, which involves a $1 billion investment in railway lines connecting Angola, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Indian Ocean. This project is the largest U.S. rail investment in Africa and is expected to create jobs and connect markets. Additionally, the United States is investing nearly $1 billion in Angola for solar energy projects, agricultural infrastructure, and digital economy connectivity. President Lourenço thanked President Biden for his support and expressed openness to cooperation in various sectors such as defense, security, transportation, energy, telecommunications, agriculture, and the use of space for peaceful purposes. President Lourenço also invited President Biden to visit Angola.
