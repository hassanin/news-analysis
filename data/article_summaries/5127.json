In her speech at the Paris Forum on Equality, Vice President Kamala Harris discusses the issue of inequality in the world. She acknowledges that inequality has always existed, but it has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Harris emphasizes the need for leaders to address this challenge and asks why these gaps in wealth, access to clean water, education, and other areas persist. She believes that these growing gaps are unacceptable and calls for collective action to bridge them.

Harris highlights that addressing inequality is not just a matter of charity but also a strategic imperative for the security, health, prosperity, and future of nations. She urges leaders to challenge the status quo, examine the systems and structures that hinder progress, and take action both domestically and globally. The United States, for instance, is committed to addressing its own systemic gaps and has passed legislation to invest in infrastructure, support workers and families, and combat climate change. Additionally, the US is doubling its climate funding, providing vaccines, and sending development assistance to nations most affected by inequality.

Harris emphasizes the importance of global solidarity in tackling inequality and cites the recent agreement at the G20 Summit on a Global Minimum Tax as an example of what can be achieved when nations work together. She believes that, in this pivotal moment, there is no challenge too big if the world unites. Harris concludes by urging government, business, and community leaders to continue asking why and taking action to create a better future.
