The Biden-Harris Administration has announced the first-ever national drinking water standard for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals." PFAS are human-made chemicals that can cause cancer and other severe health problems. The administration's action is part of President Biden's plan to combat PFAS pollution and advance environmental justice. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will require public water systems to monitor for six PFAS chemicals, notify the public if levels exceed the proposed standards, and take action to reduce PFAS levels in the water supply. The EPA estimates that if fully implemented, the rule could prevent thousands of deaths and reduce tens of thousands of serious PFAS-attributable illnesses. The administration has also released two reports on the latest science and progress in addressing and preventing PFAS contamination. Additionally, President Biden's budget includes additional resources for firefighters exposed to PFAS. The administration is committed to utilizing science and holding polluters accountable to address and prevent PFAS contamination.
