President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Cuba, which was declared in 1996, will continue beyond March 1, 2020. The decision is based on the belief that a mass migration from Cuba could endanger the security of the United States and disrupt international relations. The Cuban government has not shown a willingness to refrain from using excessive force against US vessels or aircraft engaged in memorial activities or peaceful protests north of Cuba. Additionally, unauthorized entry of US-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is seen as detrimental to US foreign policy and counter to the purpose of Executive Order 12807. The possibility of large-scale unauthorized entries could facilitate a mass migration of Cuban nationals and disturb international relations. Therefore, the national emergency and emergency authority relating to the regulation of vessel movement will be continued.
