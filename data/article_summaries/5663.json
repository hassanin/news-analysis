The Biden Administration is facilitating the air shipment of over 1 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Nestl√© Health Science amino acid-based formula from Switzerland to the US. The formula, designed for children with cow's milk protein allergies, will be distributed primarily to hospitals and home health care providers. This initiative, known as Operation Fly Formula, aims to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure there is enough safe formula for families. The Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, the General Services Administration, and the Department of Defense are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets US health and safety standards. The Biden Administration has also taken other measures to increase the availability of safe infant formula, such as invoking the Defense Production Act and issuing FDA guidance for formula manufacturers to safely import formula not currently produced for the US market.
