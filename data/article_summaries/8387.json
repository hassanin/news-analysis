President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in Hong Kong, declared in Executive Order 13936 on July 14, 2020, will continue beyond July 14, 2021. The President cites recent actions by the People's Republic of China to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy as a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined it necessary to extend the national emergency.
