The President congratulates the Senate Judiciary Committee on completing its work on the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act. He believes that the legislation largely aligns with his proposed principles of immigration reform and addresses the issue of a broken immigration system. The President praises the open and inclusive process of considering the legislation, with multiple hearings and the adoption of over a hundred amendments, many with bipartisan support. He acknowledges that not everyone got everything they wanted, including himself, but emphasizes the importance of achieving the best possible result for the American people. The President urges the full Senate to bring this bipartisan bill to the floor as soon as possible and remains hopeful that the amendment process will lead to further improvements.
