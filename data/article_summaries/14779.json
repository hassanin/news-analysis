President Obama has authorized additional disaster assistance for the state of Iowa, which was affected by severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding between May and August 2008. The increase in federal funding will cover debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance. The federal share for these measures has been raised to 100 percent for the first 14 days of the disaster. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-4600.
