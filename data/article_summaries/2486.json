The White House Press Secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, provided a topper for the trip to Los Angeles where President Biden will be hosting fellow leaders from throughout the hemisphere for the Summit of the Americas. The summit will focus on building a sustainable, resilient, and equitable future for the hemisphere and will address pressing challenges such as health systems, climate, economic growth, migration, and food security. The United States has made investments to strengthen the region's health systems and health security, and the President will announce the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity (APEP) during the summit. The summit will also address the situation in Venezuela, with the United States recognizing Juan Guaidó as the interim president and supporting a Venezuelan-led dialogue that leads to free and fair elections. The President will discuss climate and environmental issues with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, including greater energy security and climate adaptation in the Caribbean. The President is also expected to speak with Guaidó and address the issue of Venezuelan hostages. The summit will address the issue of migration and the need for shared responsibility among source, transit, and destination countries in managing migration flows. The President will announce labor pathways to the United States for migrants and measures to crack down on smuggling networks. The summit will also focus on economic growth in the hemisphere, with the launch of the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity and a commitment to institutional reform of the Inter-American Development Bank. The United States will provide support and incentives to countries participating in the migration declaration, including concessional financing and labor pathways. The President is expected to discuss the situation in Ukraine and Russian aggression with leaders at the summit and during his upcoming trip to Europe. The administration is monitoring North Korea's missile tests and is committed to defending its allies in the region. The President condemns the actions of an individual who was arrested near Brett Kavanaugh's house and supports efforts to protect public officials and justices. The administration is focused on addressing crime and gun violence and is calling on Congress to pass gun control measures. The President continues to support criminal justice reform and police reform. The administration is monitoring inflation and expects the numbers to be elevated due to factors such as higher gas prices and the war in Ukraine. The President's approval rating in a recent poll is not his focus, and he remains committed to delivering for the American people. The President is encouraged by the progress in negotiations on gun reform and believes that action needs to be taken to address gun violence.
