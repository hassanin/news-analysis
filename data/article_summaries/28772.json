The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has adopted American Cancer Society (ACS) breast cancer screening guidelines that allow women to choose to begin screening at age 40. The guidelines also recommend yearly mammograms starting at age 45 and every other year from age 55 for women at average risk for breast cancer. This aligns with VA's extensive program for breast care for veterans and ensures that their care is consistent with or exceeds care in the private sector. The VA is committed to better serving the unique healthcare needs of women veterans and wants them to be in control of their care.
