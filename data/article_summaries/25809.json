President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency with regards to the situation in Nicaragua. The declaration, made on November 27, 2018, is in response to the violent response by the Nicaraguan government to protests that began in April 2018. The regime of President Ortega has been accused of dismantling democratic institutions, undermining the rule of law, using indiscriminate violence against civilians, and engaging in corrupt practices that have destabilized the country's economy. The national emergency, initially declared for one year, will now be extended for another year, according to a notice issued by the White House on November 25, 2019. The continuation of the national emergency is said to be necessary due to the ongoing threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by the situation in Nicaragua.
