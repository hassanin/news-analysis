The White House is planning to give states more flexibility in dealing with the No Child Left Behind Act. President Obama has directed Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to move forward with plans to provide this flexibility. Congress has struggled for four years to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and fix the No Child Left Behind Act. President Obama has consistently called for reauthorization of No Child Left Behind and has asked Congress to send him a bill before the new school year begins. Since Congress has not been able to pass a bill, Secretary Duncan will be providing flexibility to states in September. Every state will be able to apply for this flexibility, but they will have to meet high standards and embrace the necessary reforms. Accountability will remain important, and states that are not able to comply with the reforms will have to comply with No Child Left Behind. The President will be putting forward his own recommendations to the Joint Select Committee, and he hopes that Congress will act in a bipartisan way to achieve significant deficit reduction. The President believes that despite the downgrade, the United States is still the safest investment in the world and the most powerful economy. He is committed to taking action to create jobs and grow the economy.
