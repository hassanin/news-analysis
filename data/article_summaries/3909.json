The United States and the European Union have welcomed the commitment by Angola, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to develop the Lobito Corridor, which will connect southern Democratic Republic of the Congo and northwestern Zambia to regional and global trade markets via the Port of Lobito in Angola. To support this development, the U.S. and EU are launching feasibility studies for a new greenfield rail line expansion between Zambia and Angola. This partnership aims to upgrade critical infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa and unlock the region's economic potential. The collaboration will involve financial resources and technical expertise to accelerate the development of the Lobito Corridor, including investments in digital access and agricultural value chains. The partnership also plans to explore cooperation in transport infrastructure investments, facilitating trade and economic development, and supporting related sectors for long-term inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
