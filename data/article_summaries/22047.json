President Barack Obama has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to North Korea. The emergency was initially declared in 2008 due to the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. The President has determined that the existence and risk of proliferation continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency and the measures adopted to address it will remain in effect for another year. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and has been communicated to Congress.
