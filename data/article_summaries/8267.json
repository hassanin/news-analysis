The Senate also added the bipartisan Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act as an amendment, furthering efforts to combat hate and violence. The legislation comes in response to a rise in anti-Asian bias and violence, with many Asian Americans living in fear for their safety. The passage of this legislation is seen as a step towards achieving justice and equality for these communities.
