On October 14, 2019, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the situation in Syria. The actions of the Government of Turkey conducting a military offensive in northeast Syria were seen as a threat to national security, the campaign against ISIS, and the peace, security, and stability of the region. As a result, the national emergency declared in 2019 will continue for another year, until October 14, 2023. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
