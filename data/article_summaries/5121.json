The American Rescue Plan, which has received support from a majority of Americans, has been passed in the House of Representatives. This legislation aims to provide resources for national vaccination efforts, direct payments to American households, expanded healthcare coverage, assistance for small businesses, unemployment insurance, food and nutrition aid, and housing support. The plan also aims to reduce child poverty. President Biden expresses gratitude to those who voted for the legislation, particularly Speaker Pelosi, and plans to sign it into law at the White House on Friday.
