President Obama is taking action to support farmers, ranchers, small businesses, and communities affected by wildfires, droughts, and other climate impacts. The National Climate Assessment confirms that climate change is already affecting every region of the country, particularly the West where rising temperatures, drought, and increased evaporation are causing water scarcity. The President's Budget proposes a new approach to addressing wildfire suppression costs, treating them as catastrophic disasters and providing certainty in addressing fire suppression needs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released an analysis showing the impacts of limited funding on local land management and wildfire mitigation in almost every state. The Administration is announcing a series of actions, including providing additional firefighting resources, fighting insects and disease in forests, improving drought and extreme weather information for Western states, increasing water and energy efficiency, and supporting comprehensive basin studies to address future water demands. California is also receiving additional support as it deals with its historic drought. The Administration is working with state and local leaders to help their communities adapt to climate change impacts and improve community preparedness and resilience to drought.
