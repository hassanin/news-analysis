This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2012, authorizing additional sanctions with respect to Iran. The order was issued in response to Iran's use of revenues from petroleum, petroleum products, and petrochemicals for illicit purposes, as well as their attempts to evade international sanctions. The order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions that conduct significant financial transactions with certain Iranian entities, such as the National Iranian Oil Company and Naftiran Intertrade Company. It also allows the Secretary of State to impose sanctions on individuals or entities that engage in significant transactions involving the purchase or acquisition of petroleum or petrochemical products from Iran. The order includes various measures to implement the sanctions, such as blocking property and interests in property, prohibiting certain financial transactions, and restricting imports. There are exceptions for transactions involving natural gas development and pipeline projects initiated prior to the effective date of the order. The order also prohibits the making of donations to sanctioned persons and includes provisions to prevent evasion of the sanctions. The order defines various terms related to the sanctions and provides the Secretary of the Treasury with the authority to take necessary actions to carry out the order.
