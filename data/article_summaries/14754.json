The President expresses his pleasure in the Senate's confirmation of Jack Lew as the next Treasury Secretary. He believes that there is no one more qualified for the position at this critical time for the economy and the country. Jack Lew's previous role as Chief of Staff to the President and his reputation as a master of fiscal issues who can work with leaders from both parties have prepared him well for this job. The President will continue to rely on Lew's advice and judgment as they work towards creating middle-class jobs, providing necessary skills, and ensuring decent wages for all hardworking Americans.
