Executive Order 13558, titled "Export Coordination Enforcement Center," was issued by President Barack Obama on November 9, 2010. The order aims to strengthen and coordinate the enforcement of United States export control laws and enhance intelligence exchange in support of those efforts. It establishes an interagency Federal Export Enforcement Coordination Center (Center) within the Department of Homeland Security. The Center will coordinate export enforcement among various executive departments and agencies, including the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy, and Homeland Security, as well as the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The Center will have a Director, two Deputy Directors, and an Intelligence Community Liaison. Its functions include coordinating and enhancing export control enforcement efforts, facilitating information exchange, serving as a point of contact between enforcement authorities and export licensing agencies, coordinating public outreach activities, and establishing statistical tracking capabilities for export control enforcement activities. The Department of Homeland Security will operate and provide funding and administrative support for the Center. The order emphasizes that it should be implemented in compliance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It does not grant exclusive investigative authority to any agency, and agencies will continue to investigate export violations in accordance with their existing authorities, with coordination through the Center. The order does not create any legal rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
