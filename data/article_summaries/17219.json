The White House has announced a new initiative to address the backlog of rape kits in law enforcement storage rooms and crime labs across the country. The initiative, called the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, will invest $41 million this year to help communities accelerate the testing of the estimated 400,000 backlogged rape kits. Testing these kits can lead to new DNA matches, identification of serial rapists, and increased rates of arrest and prosecution. In addition to this initiative, the Administration has invested $430 million in violence against women programs in Fiscal Year 2015. The President's FY 2016 Budget proposes an additional $41 million to continue the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative. The budget also includes $20 million for research to identify more effective strategies to reduce the backlog of sexual assault kits. The Department of Justice is accepting applications for this grant through May 7, 2015. The President's budget also requests an unprecedented $473.5 million for the U.S. Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women to combat and respond to violent crimes against women. This includes funding for programs such as STOP Grants to Combat Violence Against Women and the Sexual Assault Services Program. The budget also includes funding for two new initiatives: the Violence Against Women 20/20 Initiative and the Tribal Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction grant program. The White House has highlighted their efforts to fight violence against women, including the establishment of the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, the launch of the 1is2many PSA, and the unveiling of the "It's On Us" campaign. They have also emphasized the importance of the Affordable Care Act in providing coverage and support for survivors of domestic and sexual violence.
