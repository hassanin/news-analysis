The White House is hosting the second annual Summit on Next Generation High Schools, bringing together leadership teams from six states and over 20 school districts. The summit aims to redesign high schools to make them more engaging and relevant to today's students. The commitments made by states, school districts, and the private sector at the summit highlight the growing momentum behind the Next Generation High School movement. The U.S. Department of Education is also announcing new resources to support the creation of Next Generation High Schools, including progress updates, issue briefs, and a guide to federal funding streams. Additionally, education leaders from six states are sharing their commitments to advancing Next Generation High Schools, which include professional learning communities, rethinking high schools according to Next Generation principles, expanding scalable opportunities, and reforming graduation requirements. Private sector organizations are also announcing resources to support Next Generation High Schools, such as a roadmap for improving low graduation rate high schools, the announcement of winning teams for the Super School Project, and initiatives to build capacity for high school redesign.
