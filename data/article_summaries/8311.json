President Biden has vetoed a resolution passed by the District of Columbia Council that would disapprove the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022. While he acknowledges that he does not support every provision of the Act, he believes that it includes important police reforms such as banning chokeholds, setting restrictions on the use of force, improving access to body-worn camera recordings, and requiring officer training on de-escalation and use of force. President Biden argues that public safety depends on public trust and that the Congress should respect the District of Columbia's right to pass measures that improve public safety and trust. He continues to call on Congress to pass police reform legislation.
