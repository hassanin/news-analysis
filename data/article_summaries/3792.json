The Biden-Harris Administration is prioritizing global health security as a crucial part of national biodefense. The COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks have shown the devastating impacts of infectious diseases on health, economies, and societies. The United States is partnering with countries worldwide to build stronger global health security capacity, which includes the ability to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from public health threats. This not only protects the health of Americans but also people around the world. The Administration has released its annual report, highlighting its actions to implement the National Biodefense Strategy and enhance pandemic preparedness. By 2025, the United States aims to directly support at least 50 countries in strengthening their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. The United States has expanded bilateral partnerships with 25 partner countries, working on disease surveillance, biosafety, emergency operations, training for health workers, and legal preparedness. Various U.S. government agencies are involved in this effort. In Fiscal Year 2022, the United States has provided nearly $800 million in bilateral support, with an increase from the previous year. Investing in global health security today can save trillions of dollars and millions of lives. The report highlights key outcomes, such as partner countries improving their capacity in five technical areas and making progress in zoonotic disease control, laboratory capacity, emergency preparedness, and risk communication. The report also emphasizes the impact of U.S. investments in partnership with countries, such as the development of tools, procedures, and surveillance networks. The United States aims to encourage other donors and multilateral partners to take action in global health security.
