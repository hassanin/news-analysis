During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki made several announcements and provided updates on various topics. Here are the key points:

1. Accessibility and inclusion efforts: Starting that day, the White House would have an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter for daily press briefings as part of the administration's commitment to inclusivity.

2. COVID-19 travel restrictions: President Biden would sign a presidential proclamation to maintain travel restrictions for the European Schengen area, the UK, Republic of Ireland, and Brazil due to the emergence of faster-spreading variants. South Africa would also be added to the restricted list. International travelers to the US would need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test within three days of travel.

3. Assistance to states for vaccination efforts: The Biden administration would be working closely with states to address their needs for vaccine distribution. FEMA was deployed to assist an understaffed vaccine distribution center in West Virginia, in line with the President's directive to FEMA to support vaccination efforts.

4. Public health briefings: The administration would begin regular public health briefings three times a week to provide updates on the virus and the government's response. These briefings would be led by public health officials and members of the COVID-19 response team.

5. Executive order on military service: President Biden issued an executive order stating that all Americans qualified to serve in the armed forces should be able to do so, regardless of gender identity. The order also called for the reexamination of cases of transgender service members who were discharged or separated due to their gender identity.

6. Executive order on "Buy American": The President signed an executive order to support American manufacturing by directing federal agencies to close loopholes in how "Made in America" products are measured. The order also appointed a senior White House official to oversee and enforce the policy.

Psaki also addressed questions on various topics, including protests in Russia, the COVID-19 relief package, vaccine distribution, US-China relations, and the future of the "Remain in Mexico" policy. She noted that President Biden would be briefed regularly on COVID-19 developments and that he would be engaging with members of both parties to move the relief package forward. Psaki also indicated that the President's position on the death penalty is opposed to it.
