President Obama will celebrate National Mentoring Month by welcoming a group of new mentees into the White House mentoring program. The program pairs young men and women from area high schools with White House staffer mentors for a year-long program. The program aims to encourage educational opportunities, community service, potential careers, and increase knowledge of the federal government. The event will be attended by mentees from various mentoring programs across the country. The President will emphasize the importance of mentoring and the need for mentors in communities. The First Lady will deliver remarks and introduce Anthony Saldana as the "Big/Little Brother of the Year" who will introduce the President. The White House Mentorship Program launched by the First Lady has included monthly activities and opportunities for mentees to engage with her. Mentors have also connected with their mentees outside of the monthly activities.
