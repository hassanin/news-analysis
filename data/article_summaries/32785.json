Russia has vetoed the renewal of the United Nations-Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), which has been investigating chemical weapons attacks in Syria. The JIM recently reported that the Assad regime has killed over 100 citizens, including children and women, with the chemical weapon sarin. They have also identified ISIS as responsible for sulfur mustard attacks in Syria. The United States is determined to press the UN Security Council to renew the JIM's mandate to continue identifying the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks and seeking justice for the victims.
