This article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued by the President of the United States regarding the protection of American investors from significant risks posed by Chinese companies. The memorandum highlights the importance of the integrity of U.S. financial markets and the need for Chinese companies to abide by investor protections. It mentions that Chinese companies have benefited from U.S. financial markets but have not complied with transparency and accountability requirements. The Chinese government has prevented audit firms from providing necessary information to U.S. financial regulators, raising concerns about the reliability of financial reports and the safety of investments. The President's Working Group on Financial Markets is tasked with discussing these risks and submitting a report with recommendations for actions to protect investors. The report should include recommendations for executive branch actions, actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and additional actions by federal agencies to ensure investor protection. The memorandum includes general provisions and authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to publish it in the Federal Register.
