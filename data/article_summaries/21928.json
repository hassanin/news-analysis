President Barack Obama signed H.R. 3304, the "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014," into law. The President stated that he signed the legislation because it provides pay and bonuses for service members, enhances counterterrorism initiatives, strengthens partnerships with key allies, and expands efforts to prevent sexual assault and protect victims. However, he expressed his concerns about the continued operation of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, stating that it weakens national security, strains resources, damages relationships with allies, and emboldens extremists. He called on Congress to work with his administration to close the facility and highlighted that Section 1035 of the Act provides additional flexibility to transfer detainees abroad. The President emphasized the need for the executive branch to have the authority to determine when and where to prosecute detainees and expressed opposition to funding restrictions in Sections 1033 and 1034 that limit options available to the executive branch. He pledged to work with Congress to remove these restrictions and stated that if any provisions violate constitutional separation of powers, his administration will implement them in a manner that avoids a constitutional conflict.
