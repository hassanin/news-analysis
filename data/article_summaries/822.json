In a meeting with business leaders, President Biden emphasized the urgent need to raise the debt limit to prevent a catastrophic event in the US economy. He stressed that raising the debt limit is about paying old debts and has nothing to do with new spending. The President criticized Senate Republicans for planning to block the vote to raise the debt limit using a filibuster, and he called on them to stop playing "Russian roulette" with the economy. Several CEOs, including Jane Fraser from Citibank and Adena Friedman from NASDAQ, expressed their concerns about the economic consequences of a failure to raise the debt limit, including increased borrowing costs for consumers and small businesses, market volatility, and damage to America's credibility. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, emphasized the importance of meeting obligations and called for the elimination of the debt ceiling. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen warned that failing to raise the debt limit would lead to a catastrophic outcome, including a financial crisis, recession, and harm to Americans who depend on federal payments. She urged Congress to take immediate action.
