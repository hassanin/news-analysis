The United States congratulates Libya on the first anniversary of their revolution. The peaceful protesters in cities like Benghazi and Tripoli brought down a four-decade-old dictatorship with the support of the United States and an international coalition. The Libyan people are now enjoying new liberties and preparing for the first free and fair elections in the country's history. The United States is ready to assist Libya as they build their democracy and institutions. The Transitional National Council and government should make decisions openly and transparently to take full advantage of this historic moment. It is important to protect the rights of all Libyan people to preserve the unity of purpose that defined the revolution. The United States is grateful to the American service-members and civilians who helped save lives and stand up to tyranny. They are proud to have supported Libya's revolution and look forward to building a close friendship with a free Libya in the future.
