Vice President Mike Pence visited the North Carolina Biotech Center and Research Triangle Park to mark a milestone in Operation Warp Speedâ€”the start of phase three clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. Pence commended the work of Wake Research and thanked the volunteers participating in the trials. He emphasized the importance of continuing efforts to slow the spread of the virus, including practicing good hygiene and wearing masks. Pence also highlighted the progress being made in developing therapeutics and vaccines, including a historic deal with Kodak to produce active ingredients for generic drugs in the U.S. He assured the American people that no corners will be cut in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, and that tens of millions of doses will be available once approved. Pence expressed gratitude to Congress for their support and pledged to continue supporting American ingenuity and research until a vaccine is available.
