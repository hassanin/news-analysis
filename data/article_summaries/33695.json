Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper briefed President Trump on recent military activities in the Middle East. They discussed the attacks on an Iraqi facility that threatened American forces, emphasizing that such actions will not be tolerated. The Department of Defense launched offensive actions against Kata'ib Hezbollah, an Iranian-sponsored militia group, targeting command and control facilities and weapons caches. The strikes were successful, and further actions will be taken if necessary to defend US personnel and deter bad behavior from militia groups or Iran.
