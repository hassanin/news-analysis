The White House held a press call to discuss the P5+1 nuclear negotiations with Iran. The officials explained that Iran will be required to grant access to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to investigate suspicious sites anywhere in the country. They also mentioned that there is a mechanism in place to ensure access to sites where there is a disagreement about inspection. The officials emphasized the importance of inspections and transparency in the agreement. They also mentioned that the negotiations were tough, but progress was made on issues such as deployed centrifuges, advanced centrifuges, and R&D constraints. The President was actively involved in the negotiations, regularly meeting with the negotiating team and providing guidance. The President also made calls to foreign leaders and briefed members of Congress on the framework. The officials acknowledged that the deal is not guaranteed and that there are still technical details to be worked out. They also mentioned that the lifting of sanctions will be linked to Iran's completion of major nuclear steps and will be reversible.
