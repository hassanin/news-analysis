President Biden and Vice President Harris are taking steps to provide student debt relief and support borrowers. In response to a Supreme Court ruling, the Department of Education is implementing a 12-month "on-ramp" to repayment, from October 2023 to September 2024, to protect financially vulnerable borrowers from negative consequences. The administration is committed to making education a ticket to the middle class and has already taken measures to make college more affordable and federal student loans more manageable. The Department of Education has initiated rulemaking to offer an alternative path to debt relief and has finalized the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, which will cut borrowers' monthly payments in half and ensure their balances don't grow from unpaid interest. Additionally, the Department is creating a temporary on-ramp to protect borrowers from harsh consequences of late or missed payments. Borrowers who can pay should do so, but this on-ramp period gives those who cannot make payments immediately the necessary time to adjust and meet their financial obligations.
