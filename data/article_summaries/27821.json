President Donald J. Trump will award the Medal of Honor to Master Chief Special Warfare Operator (Sea, Air, and Land) Britt K. Slabinski, U.S. Navy, Retired, for his courageous actions in 2002. Slabinski led a reconnaissance team in a mission against Al-Qaida forces in Afghanistan. Despite facing heavy enemy fire, he rallied his team, attempted to rescue a stranded teammate, and engaged in a close-quarters firefight against heavily armed enemy forces. Slabinski maneuvered his team to a more defensible position, called for air support, and carried a seriously wounded teammate down a sheer cliff face. He stabilized casualties and continued fighting until the mountaintop was secured. Slabinski retired after serving as Director of Naval Special Warfare Safety Assurance and Analysis Program, completing 9 overseas deployments and 15 combat deployments. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who demonstrate exceptional bravery and self-sacrifice in the face of great risk.
