According to the annual estimate by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, poppy cultivation in Mexico decreased by 5% in 2018 compared to 2017. Similarly, potential pure production of heroin decreased by 4% during the same period. However, the production of heroin remained above 100 metric tons for the second consecutive year, indicating a continued threat to the United States. Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the US, with 91% of seized heroin originating from Mexico in 2017. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2017, 47,600 Americans died of opioid-involved overdoses, with 15,482 of those deaths involving heroin. President Donald J. Trump has declared a National Emergency on the southern border to address the trafficking of heroin and other dangerous drugs from Mexico.
