President Biden's first year in office focused on creating a more equitable and effective government that delivers results for all Americans. This effort has involved multiple federal agencies and high impact service providers working to improve customer experiences with government services. The President's Budget for the upcoming year proposes over $500 million to modernize services, reduce administrative burdens, pilot new online tools, and enhance agency capacity for service delivery. By prioritizing the customer's experience, these investments aim to improve everyday interactions between Americans and the federal government. The budget also includes plans to modernize service delivery in key areas, advance life experience pilot projects, and expand departmental customer experience offerings.
