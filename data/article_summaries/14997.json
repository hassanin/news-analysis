In this letter, President Barack Obama informs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate that he has determined it is appropriate to designate Curaçao as a beneficiary country under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) and the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA). He notifies Congress of his intent to designate Curaçao as a beneficiary country and explains that once the U.S. Trade Representative determines whether Curaçao has implemented the required customs procedures under the CBTPA, Curaçao will be eligible for benefits under the CBTPA.
