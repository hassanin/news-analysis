As part of the Singapore State Visit, First Lady Michelle Obama and Mrs. Lee Hsien Loong will attend a spousal event at the National Gallery of Art. The event will feature a special performance by students from the Turnaround Arts Summer Program, a national program aimed at transforming low-performing schools through arts education. The First Lady is the honorary chair of the program, which has been implemented in 68 schools across 13 states and Washington, DC since 2011. Its goal is to address school challenges and close the achievement gap through innovative arts and music programs.
