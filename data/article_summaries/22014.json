The White House has issued an Executive Order that modifies the national emergency declared in 1997 with regards to Burma. The order imposes additional measures with respect to Burma due to the continued detention of political prisoners, efforts to undermine political reform and peace processes, military trade with North Korea, and human rights abuses. The order provides criteria for designations of persons who engage in acts that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Burma, are responsible for human rights abuses, have imported arms from North Korea, are senior officials of entities engaged in these acts, have assisted or provided support for these acts, or are owned or controlled by persons whose property is blocked. The Secretary of the Treasury has been delegated the authority to take necessary actions to carry out the order. All agencies are directed to take appropriate measures to implement the order.
