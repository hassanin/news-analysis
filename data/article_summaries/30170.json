President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act" (S. 2155). However, he has expressed concern over section 211(a) of the Act, which directs his subordinates in the executive branch to take certain positions before international bodies and to achieve consensus positions with State insurance regulators in negotiations. Trump argues that these directives infringe upon his exclusive constitutional authority to determine the time, scope, and objectives of international negotiations. While he will consider the preferences expressed by Congress and consult with State officials, he intends to implement this section in a manner consistent with his constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations.
