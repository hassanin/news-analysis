This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to North Korea. The national emergency was initially declared in 2008 due to the threat of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. It was expanded in 2010 to address the actions and policies of the North Korean government, including its unprovoked attack on a South Korean navy ship, nuclear tests, and violations of United Nations Security Council Resolutions. Additional measures were taken in 2011 to implement import restrictions. The national emergency is being continued for another year, as the threat posed by North Korea persists.
