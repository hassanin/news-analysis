The President's task force has recommended deploying high-speed internet access to rural America as a way to promote prosperity. The President's infrastructure plan aims to streamline the permitting process for broadband infrastructure and incentivize private capital investment. The plan also seeks to stimulate $1.5 trillion in new investment and shorten the project approval process to two years. This will help unshackle infrastructure projects, including rural broadband, that are currently stalled in the permitting process. The plan delegates authority to states and communities and dedicates $50 billion for rural infrastructure capital investments. 80% of these funds will be given to state governors to choose investments that address the high-priority needs of their states, while the remaining 20% will be distributed through rural performance grants. The plan also aims to increase access to capital, repair infrastructure, and reduce regulatory burdens in rural America to foster economic development.
