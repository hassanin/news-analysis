The article is a statement from President Donald Trump addressed to the Senate of the United States. The statement transmits two agreements between the United States and the Republic of Croatia: the U.S.-Croatia Extradition Agreement and the U.S.-Croatia Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement. These agreements fulfill the requirements for implementing bilateral instruments between the United States and each member of the European Union in respect to Croatia. The U.S.-Croatia Extradition Agreement modernizes the existing extradition treaty between the United States and the Republic of Croatia, updating the list of extraditable offenses and streamlining procedural requirements. The U.S.-Croatia Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement formalizes and strengthens the institutional framework for legal assistance between the two countries in criminal matters. The statement recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to these agreements.
