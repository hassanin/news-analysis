The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has expanded the emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include individuals aged 12 to 15 years old. This is seen as a positive development in the fight against the virus, as it allows parents to protect their children and teenagers to get vaccinated. Millions of 16- and 17-year-olds have already been safely vaccinated, and as more Americans get vaccinated, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are decreasing. The vaccines are proving to be effective in curbing the spread of the virus, saving lives, and helping to return to a more normal life. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will provide further recommendations in the coming days. Overall, this news brings hope and indicates progress in overcoming the pandemic.
