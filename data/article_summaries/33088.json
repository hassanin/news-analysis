President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Alabama and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe storms and tornadoes that occurred on March 19-20, 2018.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid individuals and business owners in recovering from the disaster. Federal funding is also available to the State and eligible local governments and nonprofit organizations for emergency work, facility repair, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Thomas J. McCool has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by calling the toll-free numbers provided.
