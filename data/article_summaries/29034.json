This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on August 6, 2020, focuses on protecting the United States against outbreaks of infectious diseases and threats from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear sources. The order emphasizes the need for a strong Public Health Industrial Base with domestic supply chains for essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs. The goal is to reduce dependence on foreign manufacturers and ensure sufficient and reliable long-term domestic production of these products. The order directs executive departments and agencies involved in procurement to increase their domestic procurement of essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs. It also instructs agencies to identify vulnerabilities in the nation's supply chains for these products. The order includes provisions for streamlining regulatory requirements, prioritizing and allocating essential medicines and medical countermeasures, and reporting on procurement and production efforts. It also clarifies that it does not impede the ability of state, local, tribal, or territorial governments to procure necessary resources in response to public health emergencies, nor does it hinder the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The order takes effect immediately and is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations.
