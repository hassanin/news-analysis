The attackers specifically targeted Christian worshipers, displaying a complete disregard for human life. The President emphasizes the need to bring the perpetrators of this heinous act to justice and offers any necessary assistance to the Egyptian government. In Nigeria, a separate attack near an army barracks killed over 20 people and wounded many more. The President denounces the killing of innocent civilians who were gathered to celebrate the New Year, highlighting the misguided ideology behind such attacks. The United States extends its condolences to the families of the victims and stands with the people of Nigeria and Egypt during this challenging time.
