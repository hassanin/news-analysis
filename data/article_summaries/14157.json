The statement by National Security Council Spokesman Mike Hammer discusses the Government of Israel's desire to avoid a repeat of the tragic events on the Mavi Marmara. The US remains committed to providing assistance to the people of Gaza and encourages those on board the Rachel Corrie and other vessels to sail to Ashdod to deliver their materials to Gaza for the safety of all involved. The US is working with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and international partners to develop new procedures for delivering goods and assistance to Gaza, while also increasing opportunities for the people of Gaza and preventing the importation of weapons. The current arrangements are deemed unsustainable and in need of change. The statement calls on all parties to encourage responsible decisions and avoid unnecessary confrontations to ensure the safety of everyone involved.
