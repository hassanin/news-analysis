This article is a fact sheet on NATO's commitment to Afghanistan. It highlights that NATO's mission in Afghanistan has been its largest and longest-running military operation, with 50 coalition countries contributing troops over a 15-year campaign. Since transitioning from the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission to the non-combat Resolute Support mission in 2015, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have assumed full responsibility for Afghanistan's security. At the Warsaw Summit, NATO committed to providing financial support to the ANDSF through 2020 and sustaining the Resolute Support mission beyond 2016 using a flexible, regional approach. The United States, along with NATO Allies and partners, also emphasized the importance of an Afghan-led peace and reconciliation process. Currently, 39 NATO Allies and partners have committed over 11,000 troops to sustain the Resolute Support mission beyond 2016. The mission will continue to focus on security ministries and institutional development, as well as train, advise, and assist efforts with Afghan forces. The United States will maintain approximately 8,400 troops in Afghanistan beyond 2016, with a focus on counterterrorism and supporting NATO's efforts. NATO's training and advisory efforts have shown positive results, with the ANDSF demonstrating commitment and resilience against insurgency. The Resolute Support mission will be tailored to focus on critical Afghan capabilities that are slower to develop. Financial sustainment of the ANDSF is also a priority, with NATO Allies and partners renewing pledges to sustain the Afghan security forces through 2020 and the international community pledging over $800 million annually for 2018-2020. The United States supports President Ghani's efforts to root out corruption and decrease ANDSF costs. The Afghan government has made progress in appointing key positions and implementing reforms.
