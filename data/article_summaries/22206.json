During a press briefing, Press Secretary Josh Earnest addressed several topics. He commented on Donald Trump's announcement to step away from his businesses and focus on running the country, saying that the relevant observers will have to conclude based on the details of the announcement. He also mentioned that President Obama has followed a high ethical standard, avoiding conflicts of interest. Earnest stated that the decision of House Democrats to reelect Nancy Pelosi as their leader is for them to make, but highlighted the positive relationship between Pelosi and President Obama. He mentioned that President Obama will be meeting with Nobel Laureates and that it is a tradition to invite them before they travel to Norway to accept the prize. Earnest also discussed the recent deal between Carrier and President-elect Trump to keep jobs in the U.S., saying that the Obama administration has created more manufacturing jobs than Trump has promised to save. He added that the administration will evaluate Trump's economic strategy and that this deal does not represent the same level of job creation as what the Obama administration achieved. Earnest also commented on the recent U.N. Security Council resolution imposing new sanctions on North Korea, saying that the resolution represents a substantial escalation in pressure on North Korea and that it will increase the pressure on the North Korean government to evaluate their strategy. He expressed hope that the new sanctions will lead to a change in behavior from North Korea. Earnest also discussed other topics such as the Defense Authorization bill, loan forgiveness plans for college students, wildfires in Tennessee, the funeral of Fidel Castro, and the Iran Sanctions Act.
