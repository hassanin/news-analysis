The White House Press Secretary has issued a statement commending the House for taking bipartisan action to address the crisis in Puerto Rico. While acknowledging that the legislation is not perfect, it is seen as an important first step in addressing the challenges faced by Puerto Rico. The bill aims to protect the 3.5 million Americans living in Puerto Rico from further reductions in critical public services, while also providing the tools needed to restructure its debt. The statement urges the Senate to review and vote on the measure promptly, so that the President can sign it into law before the critical July 1st debt payment deadline. In addition to the financial tools provided in the bill, the statement emphasizes the need for additional economic measures to ensure Puerto Rico's long-term economic growth, including access to quality healthcare and job opportunities for all its citizens. The statement calls on leaders from both parties to build on the bipartisan momentum and help Puerto Rico achieve lasting economic prosperity.
