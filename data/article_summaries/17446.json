The Obama administration has awarded grants to over 220 cities and counties to hire veterans for law enforcement positions as part of the Veterans Job Corps initiative. The grants aim to create or save around 800 law enforcement positions, with over 600 new positions being funded. These positions must be filled by recent military veterans who have served at least 180 days since September 11, 2001. The grants, totaling over $111 million, will be awarded to local public safety agencies across the country. The COPS Office will work with transition centers to connect veterans with the new law enforcement opportunities. This initiative is part of President Obama's efforts to support veterans in finding jobs and transitioning back into civilian life.
