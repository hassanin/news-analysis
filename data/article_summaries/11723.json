The United States announced that it will no longer produce or acquire anti-personnel landmines in the future, including to replace expiring stockpiles. This announcement was made at the Third Review Conference of the Ottawa Convention in Mozambique, which aims to prohibit the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. The United States is also actively seeking solutions that would allow it to comply with the Ottawa Convention. The US is conducting modeling and simulation efforts to mitigate the risks associated with the loss of anti-personnel landmines. Other aspects of US landmine policy are still under consideration and will be shared in due course. This announcement follows previous steps taken by the US to end the use of non-detectable and persistent landmines. The US is also the largest financial supporter of humanitarian mine action, providing aid for clearance, medical rehabilitation, and vocational training in countries affected by landmines and other explosive remnants of war. Since 1993, the US has provided over $2.3 billion in aid to more than 90 countries for conventional weapons destruction programs. These efforts help post-conflict countries rebuild and assist survivors in reintegrating into society.
