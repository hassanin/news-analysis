The article discusses various measures aimed at strengthening immigration law enforcement in the United States. These measures include stopping funding for states and localities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities, hiring more ICE officers and federal prosecutors to handle immigration cases, increasing penalties for visa overstays, correcting judicial interpretations to allow ICE to keep aliens in custody, preventing employers from hiring illegal alien labor, and detecting and countering visa fraud.
