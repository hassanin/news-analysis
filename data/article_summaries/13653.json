Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Richmond, Virginia. He discussed the topics that President Obama would be addressing in his speech, including the direction of the country, the economy, and tax cuts. Burton highlighted the difference between the President's plan to give tax cuts to Americans making up to $250,000 and the Republican plan to give tax cuts to billionaires and millionaires. He also mentioned that the President enjoys having a real exchange with the American people and addressing a wide variety of topics. Burton answered questions about the President's control of the conversations, the importance of passing a budget, the purpose of the meeting with Democratic leaders, and the priorities of passing a continuing resolution and resolving the tax cut issue. He also mentioned that the President is comfortable with the tax cuts being dealt with in whatever way necessary to ensure that middle-class Americans receive a tax cut. Burton touched on the enthusiasm gap, the thwarted al Qaeda plot, and reports of al Qaeda leaders being killed. He noted that the President struggles with tough questions but appreciates the opportunity to have frank conversations with the American people. Burton mentioned the possibility of future backyard chats and rallies in Philadelphia, Las Vegas, and Ohio, but did not have specifics. He was unsure about whether the President and First Lady would campaign together.
