During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, Press Secretary Jay Carney criticized the Senate Minority Leader for attaching the jobs bill to the China bill without debate. Carney called it a political stunt and accused the Senator of trying to draw attention away from the fact that President Obama is calling on Congress to act on jobs and the economy. Carney also highlighted that the Senator has previously stated that his number-one priority is to defeat President Obama, not the economy or jobs. Carney emphasized the urgency of addressing the economy and creating jobs and expressed hope that the American Jobs Act will be debated and voted on in both the Senate and the House.
