President Barack Obama issued a statement on March 31, 2009, to commemorate Cesar Chavez's birthday. He highlighted Chavez's legacy as an educator, environmentalist, and civil rights leader who fought for fair treatment and wages for American workers. Obama acknowledged Chavez's role in co-founding the United Farm Workers and his efforts to improve working conditions and provide a better life for hundreds of thousands of people. He emphasized that the cause of fair treatment and wages for workers continues through the work of many others. Obama also mentioned Chavez's famous rallying cry, "SÃ­ Se Puede" (Yes We Can), which symbolized hope and a rejection of those who doubted the ability of farmworkers to organize and challenge growers. He praised Chavez's courage and emphasized the power of a single voice to bring about change in the country, as well as the strength, justice, and prosperity that can be achieved when people come together.
