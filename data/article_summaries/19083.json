President Obama spoke with Afghan presidential candidates Dr. Abdullah Abdullah and Dr. Ashraf Ghani to thank them for their leadership in forming a national unity government and accepting the outcome of the full audit of the ballots from the June 14 run-off election. The President commended both candidates for prioritizing the interests of Afghanistan and working together as partners in governance. He encouraged them to publicly endorse their previously agreed political framework and continue their dialogue on its implementation to ensure the Afghan people have confidence in the electoral process. President Obama emphasized that there is no justification for rhetoric that threatens extra-constitutional measures and urged both candidates to maintain national unity during this democratic transition. Secretary Kerry will continue to consult with the candidates and President Karzai in the coming days. The President also reaffirmed the United States' commitment to the Afghan people and their future.
