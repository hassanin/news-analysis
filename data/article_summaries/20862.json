President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of South Dakota and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred between May 24-31, 2013. The federal funding will be used for emergency work, repairing or replacing damaged facilities, and implementing hazard mitigation measures. The affected areas include Bennett, Corson, Lawrence, Lincoln, and Union counties, as well as the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in Bennett County. Gary R. Stanley has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
