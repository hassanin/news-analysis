On January 27th, International Holocaust Remembrance Day, people around the world will take time to remember the millions of Jewish people and others who were murdered during the Holocaust. This day marks the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. World leaders also use this moment to condemn violence driven by religious and ethnic persecution. President Donald J. Trump stated that the nation is indebted to the Holocaust survivors, who continue to educate us about respect for human rights. The scale of the Holocaust's depravity is difficult to comprehend, with two out of every three Jewish people in Europe being killed. Stories from survivors, such as Lilly Appelbaum Malnik and Blanka Rothschild, shed light on the dehumanization and suffering experienced during this time. First Lady Melania Trump recently visited the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in tribute to the victims and survivors. She expressed her thoughts and prayers for those affected by the Holocaust and emphasized the importance of coming together in commemoration, strength, and love.
