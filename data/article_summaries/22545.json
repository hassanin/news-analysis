President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13396 with respect to the situation in or in relation to Côte d'Ivoire is to continue beyond February 7, 2012. The situation in Côte d'Ivoire has resulted in civilian massacres, human rights abuses, political violence, and attacks against international peacekeeping forces. Although progress has been made in promoting democracy and development, the situation continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency and related measures will continue.
