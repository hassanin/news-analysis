A senior Houthi delegation has visited Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, marking the first official visit by Houthi representatives to the city since the Yemen war began almost a decade ago. The visit comes after 18 months of calm following a UN-mediated truce. President Biden has prioritized de-escalating and ending the war in Yemen, and the United States has provided diplomatic support to peace efforts. The US commends Saudi Arabia's initiative and Oman's role in the process, and calls on all parties to solidify and expand on the truce's benefits to bring an end to the war.
