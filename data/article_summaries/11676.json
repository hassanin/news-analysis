The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet on the U.S. commitment to civil society. In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, President Obama highlighted the importance of civil society in open and democratic societies and expressed concern about the growing restrictions on civil society organizations globally. The administration has taken several steps to fulfill the President and Secretary Clinton's commitments, including increasing attention to civil society issues in diplomatic engagement, establishing a global fund to support embattled civil society organizations, strengthening diplomatic coordination with like-minded governments, and partnering with 37 countries to establish a human rights mechanism to monitor global freedom of assembly and association. The administration will continue to support and protect civil society activists and organizations worldwide.
