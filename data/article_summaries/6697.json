The article discusses the actions taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to address equity and racial justice in the United States. On his first day in office, the President signed an executive order directing the entire Federal government to advance an equity agenda for all Americans, including rural communities, communities of color, women and girls, Tribal communities, LGBTQI+ individuals, people with disabilities, and communities impacted by persistent poverty. The administration has made progress in advancing equity across the Federal Government, including through the release of a second executive order that strengthens opportunities for historically underserved communities. The President's Budget includes historic investments to support underserved communities and combat racial disparities in areas such as health, education, and economic opportunity. The administration also addresses inequities in the healthcare system, housing, education, job opportunities, environmental justice, the care economy, criminal justice reform, civil rights, and promotes equity across Federal government services.
