The article discusses the transmission of two bilateral maritime boundary treaties to the Senate for advice and consent. The treaties, the United States-Cuba Treaty and the United States-Mexico Treaty, aim to establish continental shelf boundaries in the eastern Gulf of Mexico beyond 200 nautical miles from shore. The United States-Cuba Treaty establishes a maritime boundary of approximately 30 nautical miles, while the United States-Mexico Treaty establishes a maritime boundary of approximately 79 nautical miles. These boundaries define each country's jurisdiction over their portion of the continental shelf. The treaties also address procedures for handling oil and gas reservoirs that extend across the continental shelf boundary. The treaties are considered to be in the best interest of the United States, providing legal certainty and protecting sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the continental shelf. The article concludes with a recommendation for the Senate to give early and favorable consideration to the treaties and provide advice and consent for their ratification.
