The White House hosted a convening of business school deans and the business community to discuss expanding opportunities for women in business. Over 45 business schools have committed to a set of best practices to help women succeed in school and their careers. These best practices focus on ensuring access to business schools and careers, preparing students for the future workforce, providing career services beyond traditional students, and exemplifying how organizations should be run. The American workforce has evolved, with women making up nearly half of the workforce and men taking on more childcare responsibilities. However, businesses have not fully adapted to these changes, and women still face unique barriers in business careers. The Council of Economic Advisers released an Issue Brief highlighting these barriers and the need for business schools and the business community to work together to encourage women's success. The convening builds on previous meetings hosted by the Administration to address this issue. The best practices will be housed on the website of AACSB International, and AACSB has appointed its first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Advocate to lead these efforts. The convening and commitments by business schools and AACSB are steps towards helping women succeed in the business community and the broader workforce.
