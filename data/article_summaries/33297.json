This article is a proclamation issued by President Donald Trump on August 10, 2018. The proclamation discusses the adjustment of tariffs on imports of steel articles to protect the national security of the United States. The Secretary of Commerce had previously found that steel imports were threatening the national security. In March 2018, a 25 percent ad valorem tariff was imposed on steel imports from most countries. However, imports have not declined as much as anticipated and capacity utilization in the domestic steel industry has not reached the target level. As a result, a higher tariff of 50 percent ad valorem is imposed on steel imports from Turkey starting on August 13, 2018. The proclamation is made under the authority of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and the Trade Act of 1974. The proclamation also includes modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.
