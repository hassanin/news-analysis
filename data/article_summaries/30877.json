The Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) have recognized the COVID-19 pandemic as a global health crisis and acknowledge its major risks to the world economy. They are committed to taking necessary actions for a strong global response through enhanced cooperation and coordination. While national emergency measures may be needed, they emphasize the stability of the global economy. They believe that a coordinated international approach, based on science and evidence and utilizing the strengths of private enterprise, is essential. Their objectives include protecting the health and safety of their countries' citizens, delaying the spread of the virus, strengthening health systems, supporting the World Health Organization, sharing real-time information, pooling data, conducting research, increasing availability of medical equipment, and maximizing public access to accurate information. They also aim to address the economic impact of the outbreak by mobilizing monetary and fiscal measures, supporting affected workers, companies, and sectors, coordinating with central banks, and facilitating international trade. Their ultimate goal is not only to restore pre-pandemic growth levels but also to build a foundation for stronger future growth. They will continue to work together through the G7 Presidency and call on the G20 for support.
