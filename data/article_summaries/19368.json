Vice President Joe Biden and members of the Cabinet discussed plans to apply the competitive-based model of the Recovery Act's Race to the Top program to new education, infrastructure, and energy initiatives. The success of the Race to the Top program has led to more education reform in the last two years than the country has seen in a generation. The competitive model is now being applied to new initiatives in education, clean energy, and infrastructure. The meeting also highlighted the importance of inter-agency collaboration to cut through red tape and deliver for the American people. The Recovery Act has been successful in creating jobs, improving the economy, and funding various projects across the country. It has also supported innovation and technology, renewable energy, smart energy grid, health IT, clean cars, broadband access, roads, high-speed rail, levees, water systems, and brownfields cleanup. The Recovery Act has also provided relief for hard-hit families and businesses through tax credits, unemployment benefits, nutritional assistance, higher education assistance, and small business loans.
