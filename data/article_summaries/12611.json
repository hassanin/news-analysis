The United Steelworkers (USW) have expressed their support for President Obama's American Jobs Act. They believe that job creation should be a top priority for Congress, as unemployment rates remain high and the economy is stagnant. They commend the President for calling Congress into a joint session, signaling that this issue is not business as usual. The USW believes that the proposed investments in infrastructure will drive new jobs in manufacturing, and they agree that the next generation of manufacturing should be Made in America. They view the American Jobs Act as a promising tool to ignite economic growth, reduce unemployment, and provide sustainable jobs. They highlight the importance of establishing a national infrastructure bank, reshaping the tax code, refocusing the trade agenda, and promoting infrastructure projects. They also call for individuals and corporations to pay their fair share and for social programs like Medicare and Social Security to continue efficiently. They urge Republicans to join Democrats in supporting the jobs plan and to abandon their obstructionist tactics. The USW is committed to doing their part and supporting the Administration's plan.
