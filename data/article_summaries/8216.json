United Airlines will transport approximately 3.7 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula free of charge from London to multiple airports in the United States. This is part of Operation Fly Formula, an initiative launched by President Biden to expedite the import of infant formula and ensure its availability in stores. The first shipment, which includes Kendamil Classic and Kendamil Organic formula, will be available for purchase at Target stores nationwide. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed Kendal Nutricare to import infant formula under the Kendamil brand, with plans to export up to 2 million cans to the United States. The Biden Administration has also invoked the Defense Production Act, reopened Abbott Nutrition's Sturgis facility, and issued FDA guidance to ensure an adequate supply of safe infant formula.
