The article is a message from the White House announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Burma. The President states that although significant progress has been made in Burma since 2011, including the release of political prisoners and improvements in labor standards, there are still concerns regarding obstacles to full civilian control, ongoing conflict and human rights abuses, and military trade with North Korea. The President believes that the situation in Burma continues to pose a threat to national security and foreign policy, and therefore, the national emergency needs to be extended. However, the United States remains committed to working with the new government and the people of Burma to ensure a successful democratic transition.
