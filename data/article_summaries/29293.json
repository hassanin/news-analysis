President Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of New Hampshire and has ordered Federal assistance to help with recovery efforts from a severe storm and flooding that occurred from October 29 to November 1, 2017. The Federal funding will be available to the State, local governments, and certain nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and repairs or replacements of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive Federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
