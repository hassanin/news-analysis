President Obama has signed a bill that aims to support American workers, their families, and small businesses during the challenging economic times. The bill includes provisions to extend access to healthcare benefits for workers who have lost their jobs, provide loans to small businesses to promote growth and hiring, and extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of Americans who are unemployed and searching for work. The President expressed his gratitude to the Senate members from both parties who worked together to overcome obstacles and provide relief for working families in the United States.
