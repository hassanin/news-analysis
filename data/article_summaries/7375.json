In this letter, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reports on recent attacks conducted by Iran-affiliated militia groups against United States personnel and facilities in Iraq and Syria. He explains that, in response to these attacks and the threat of future attacks, targeted strikes were conducted against facilities used by these militia groups. The strikes were aimed at degrading their capabilities and deterring further attacks, while also minimizing the risk of escalation and civilian casualties. President Biden states that these actions were taken to protect and defend U.S. personnel and assets in Iraq, in line with the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. He further justifies the military action as consistent with his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive, as well as the United States' right of self-defense under international law. The President concludes by expressing his readiness to take further action if necessary, and he provides this report to Congress in accordance with the War Powers Resolution.
