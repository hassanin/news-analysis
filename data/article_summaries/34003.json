President Trump held a press conference to announce several executive actions he is taking to provide relief to Americans amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The actions include a payroll tax holiday for Americans earning less than $100,000 per year, eviction protection for renters and homeowners, additional unemployment benefits of $400 per week, and relief for student loan borrowers. The President also criticized Democrats for blocking measures to support schools, businesses, and healthcare, and accused them of pushing for unrelated policies and bailout money for poorly managed states. He expressed his intention to extend the payroll tax cut if reelected and mentioned the possibility of additional tax cuts. The President signed executive orders and memorandums to implement the actions, and stated that the relief will be distributed rapidly. He also mentioned the possibility of legal challenges but expressed confidence that the actions will prevail in court.
