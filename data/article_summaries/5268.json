President Joseph R. Biden has proclaimed May 16-22, 2021, as Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Week in the United States. This year's theme, "THIS IS EMS: Caring for Our Communities," recognizes the heroic work of EMS providers who have been on the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proclamation acknowledges the selflessness, professionalism, and dedication of EMS providers who save lives, protect communities, and offer hope in times of crisis. It also highlights their efforts in supporting COVID-19 testing, therapeutics, and vaccination sites. The President's American Rescue Plan includes $100 million to support the mental well-being of healthcare professionals, including EMS providers. The proclamation urges Americans to express their gratitude for EMS providers and encourages everyone to get vaccinated to help end the pandemic.
