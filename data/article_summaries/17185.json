In this article, President Barack Obama urges Congress to pass the historic Wall Street reform law, which will implement the strictest financial reforms since the Great Depression. The law includes strong measures to protect consumers and create an independent agency to enforce compliance. It also addresses the issue of derivatives and prohibits FDIC-protected banks from engaging in risky deals. The law aims to end financial bailouts and ensure that the average citizen does not bear the responsibility for Wall Street's mistakes. President Obama emphasizes the importance of these reforms in building a strong and prosperous economy. He also calls for imposing fees on banks that benefited from taxpayer assistance during the financial crisis. Despite opposition, the President urges Congress to send him a reform bill that he can sign into law to protect consumers and prevent future financial crises.
