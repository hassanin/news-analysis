The Department of Energy (DOE) has released an issue brief outlining the positive impact of solar investments on job creation and consumer costs for energy. The brief highlights President Biden's proposed investments in solar energy through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and Build Back Better Agenda, which aim to support infrastructure, manufacturing, innovation, and incentives for solar power. These investments will lead to the creation of good-paying, union jobs, make solar energy affordable for all American families, and accelerate the deployment of net-zero energy across the country. To showcase these benefits, administration officials are engaging with industry, academia, homeowners, and stakeholders across the country. The issue brief emphasizes that the United States has a strong foundation in the solar industry and that new investments can help the country regain its leadership position in the global solar market. The DOE plans to require awardees of taxpayer-funded innovations to manufacture their products domestically, creating more jobs. By seizing the opportunity within the solar industry, the United States can create thousands of jobs, expand manufacturing, make solar energy affordable, and lower utility bills, while also meeting President Biden's climate goals.
