The Obama Administration has released a report on the health and economic benefits of taking global action on climate change. The report compares two scenarios: one with significant action on climate change and one with no action. It quantifies the differences in health, infrastructure, and ecosystem impacts under the two scenarios, showing the costs of inaction and the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The key findings of the report include that global action on climate change reduces the frequency of extreme weather events and associated impacts, and it is projected to save thousands of lives and billions of dollars annually by the end of the century. The report also highlights that delaying action on emissions reductions will likely reduce these benefits. Additionally, global action on climate change is shown to avoid costly damages in the United States in various sectors. The report emphasizes that climate change impacts are not equally distributed, with some regions being more vulnerable than others. It also states that adaptation measures can help reduce damages and costs. The report is a product of the Climate Change Impacts and Risks Analysis (CIRA) project, which involves collaboration between the EPA, MIT, Pacific Northwest National Lab, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and other partners.
