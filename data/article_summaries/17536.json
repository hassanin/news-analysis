President Obama spoke with Russian President Medvedev to congratulate him on Russia's invitation to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). They discussed how Russia's membership in the WTO will benefit both countries by lowering tariffs, improving access to Russia's markets, and enforcing trade rules. This will generate more export opportunities for American manufacturers and farmers, leading to more jobs in the United States. President Obama also expressed his commitment to working with Congress to end the application of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to Russia, ensuring that American firms and exporters enjoy the same benefits as their international competitors. They also discussed the recent elections and subsequent demonstrations in Russia. President Obama raised concerns about flaws in the election process and praised the peaceful demonstrations held throughout the country. They agreed to meet again at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, South Korea in March 2012.
