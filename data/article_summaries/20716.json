The White House held a briefing for congressional leaders on the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons in Syria. Senior Administration Officials, including National Security Advisor Susan Rice and Secretary of State John Kerry, briefed the leaders on the Administration's thinking and sought their input on the U.S. response. The call lasted 90 minutes and 15 members asked questions. Some of the members who participated in the briefing included Speaker John Boehner, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Dick Durbin. The views of Congress are important to the President's decision-making process, and further engagement with members will continue as the President reaches a decision on the appropriate U.S. response.
