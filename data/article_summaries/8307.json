During a press briefing, White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre discussed President Biden's upcoming trip to Lake Charles and New Orleans. In Lake Charles, the President will discuss the choice facing the American people between investing in the middle class and economic strength or cutting taxes for the wealthy and big corporations. In New Orleans, he will tour the Carrollton Water Plant and highlight the need for investments in water infrastructure. Jean-Pierre emphasized the urgent need for infrastructure improvements in Louisiana, including the state's poor condition of bridges and highways, the increase in commute times, and the damage caused by extreme weather events. She also highlighted the need for investments in internet access and drinking water infrastructure. The President's American Jobs Plan aims to address these needs and more. 

Jean-Pierre mentioned that the President will contrast his middle-class agenda with an opposing vision that prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. She also discussed the bipartisan support for infrastructure investments and the President's willingness to negotiate with Republicans on his infrastructure plan. She stressed that the President's only red line is inaction, and that he wants the plan to be paid for without burdening the American people. 

The briefing also covered other topics such as the 2020 election, unemployment benefits, Ukraine's application to join NATO, the waiver of COVID vaccine patents, and the eviction moratorium. Jean-Pierre stated that the administration supports Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO and that the President made the decision to support the waiver of COVID vaccine patents. She also addressed concerns about unemployment benefits and the eviction moratorium. The briefing concluded with a mention of ongoing discussions about lifting travel restrictions from Europe.
