The United States and the European Union have made an agreement to negotiate a carbon-based sectoral arrangement on steel and aluminum trade by 2024. This is seen as a major step in addressing the climate crisis while also protecting workers and industries. The arrangement aims to reduce emissions and create good-paying union jobs. Additionally, the United States and the European Union have reached an interim arrangement that modifies tariffs on European Union steel and aluminum providers, addresses global overcapacity, and strengthens enforcement mechanisms to prevent Chinese steel and aluminum from entering the U.S. market. As a result, the European Union will remove tariffs on various products, protecting American jobs and reducing costs for middle-class families. The United States and European Union will also work together to restrict access to their markets for "dirty" steel and limit access to countries that dump steel in their markets. This arrangement will be open to any country that meets the criteria for reducing trade in high-carbon steel and aluminum products.
