Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the President and White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, and White House officials recently held a meeting with state legislative leaders from New York, Delaware, California, and Illinois. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss how states are taking the lead in holding gun manufacturers accountable. President Biden has been urging Congress to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a federal law that provides gun manufacturers and dealers with more liability protection than tobacco and alcohol companies. The law prevents many victims of gun violence from seeking legal recourse and hinders public demands for reforms in the gun industry. While the President continues to call for the repeal of PLCAA, the White House is also collaborating with state and local officials to develop strategies for holding gun manufacturers and dealers accountable for illegal activities. One approach being pursued is the enactment of state firearm-specific liability laws, which would allow litigation to proceed under PLCAA. States like New York, Delaware, and California have already implemented such laws, and other states are working to join in this effort. The meeting aimed to discuss these state-specific liability laws and explore how they can contribute to gun industry accountability.
