On March 6, 2003, President Biden declared a national emergency and blocked the property of certain persons in Zimbabwe who were undermining the country's democratic processes or institutions. This action was taken under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In subsequent years, additional executive orders were issued to expand the scope of the national emergency and block the property of more individuals involved in undermining democracy in Zimbabwe. The President has now announced that the national emergency will continue for another year, as the actions and policies of certain members of the Zimbabwean government still pose a threat to the foreign policy of the United States. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
