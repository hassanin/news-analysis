Dr. Jill Biden wrote an op-ed in Time about Memory Banda, a young woman from Malawi who stood up against harmful traditions and fought for girls' rights. Banda refused to participate in an initiation camp where girls are taught to obey and please their future husbands, often leading to early marriages and pregnancy. Instead, Banda pursued education and successfully lobbied to raise the legal age of marriage in Malawi from 15 to 18. She is now enrolled at the University of Malawi and aims to get a master's degree in the US. Banda's story highlights the power of one girl's determination to create change and inspire others.
