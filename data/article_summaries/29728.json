In a recent remarks made in the Roosevelt Room, President Trump announced a new initiative to require drug makers to disclose prices to consumers. He also emphasized that the Republican Party is becoming the party of healthcare and is determined to end surprise medical billing for American patients. The President highlighted the actions his administration has already taken to make healthcare more affordable, such as expanding lower-cost health insurance plans and reducing the price of prescription drugs. He also mentioned the possibility of allowing states to buy drugs from other countries at lower prices. The President shared stories of individuals who have experienced surprise medical bills, emphasizing the need to hold insurance companies and hospitals accountable. He announced principles that should guide Congress in developing bipartisan legislation to end surprise medical billing, including prohibiting balance billing for emergency care, providing upfront pricing for non-emergency care, and protecting patients from surprise bills from out-of-network providers. The President urged Democrats and Republicans to work together on this issue and expressed his hope for a successful resolution.
