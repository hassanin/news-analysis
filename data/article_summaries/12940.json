The President commends lawmakers from both parties for passing the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. This bipartisan compromise will provide workers, including those with disabilities, with access to employment, education, training, and support services to advance their careers. The President believes this will help workers acquire the skills that employers are currently seeking, enabling American businesses to compete globally. The President looks forward to signing the bill into law and hopes that Congress will continue to work together to benefit working families in America.
