The article criticizes Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for signing a permitless concealed carry bill into law shortly after a school shooting. The bill eliminates the requirement for a license to carry a concealed weapon. The article argues that this goes against common sense gun safety and mentions previous instances of gun violence in Florida. It also highlights President Biden's call for Congress to take action on gun control, including banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines, requiring safe storage of firearms, eliminating gun manufacturers' immunity from liability, and implementing background checks for all gun sales.
