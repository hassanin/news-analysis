The President spoke with 25 bipartisan Governors about the government shutdown and its impact on state budgets and the economy. He argued that the strategy of shutting down the government and threatening default is detrimental to the country. The President mentioned that the prolonged shutdown is negatively affecting consumer confidence, businesses, and local economies that rely on tourism at national parks and monuments. He expressed his willingness to negotiate on ways to grow the economy, create jobs, and address fiscal health, but emphasized the need to avoid crisis atmosphere during the shutdown and threat of default.
