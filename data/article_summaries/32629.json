On January 23, 1995, the President declared a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat posed by foreign terrorists who disrupt the Middle East peace process. This declaration was modified in 1998 and clarified in 2005. The President now states that these terrorist activities still pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 1995 will continue for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
