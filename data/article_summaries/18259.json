The White House Office of the Press Secretary has announced that the public review and rating period for the Race to the Top High School Commencement Challenge has begun. The rating period will end on April 29th, and the schools will be rated based on a video and an essay on how they are preparing students for success. President Obama has encouraged the public to rate the six finalists, and the three schools with the highest average ratings will be announced on May 2nd. The final winner will be selected by President Obama later that week. The videos for each finalist school were produced with support from the Get Schooled Foundation, and Viacom provided producer and camera equipment to help the students bring their applications to life. The President's goal is to have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020, and the Commencement Challenge invited public high schools to demonstrate their commitment to preparing students for college and careers. The six finalists were selected based on their engagement and support for students, academic results, and progress in preparing students for college and careers.
