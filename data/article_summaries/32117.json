The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has released a report on the potential effects of expanding work requirements for non-disabled working-age adults in social welfare programs. The report highlights the decline in the labor force participation rate among working-age Americans, particularly those in low-income households. To address this issue, President Trump signed an executive order in April 2018, instructing agencies to reform welfare programs by encouraging work and reducing dependence. The report emphasizes the importance of work requirements in promoting employment and self-sufficiency. It also discusses the potential positive effects of work requirements on adult employment and child outcomes. The report suggests that the current labor market conditions, with low unemployment rates, make it an opportune time to expand work requirements. However, it also acknowledges the need to carefully design these requirements and provide support to overcome barriers to employment. Overall, the report argues that expanded work requirements can improve the lives of welfare recipients while respecting the importance and dignity of work.
