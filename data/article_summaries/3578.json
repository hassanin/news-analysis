The strength of U.S.-ASEAN relations is based on the friendship between the one billion people of the two regions. The United States provides over $70 million annually to support educational and cultural exchanges with Southeast Asia, fostering understanding and cooperation. At the 2022 U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit, President Biden and Vice President Harris expanded the United States' investment in educational and people-to-people ties. They emphasized the importance of youth leaders, with nearly 6,000 Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) program alumni and over 150,000 members in the YSEALI network. The YSEALI Matters Forum: Leading with Impact brought together 40 YSEALI alumni in Indonesia to discuss impactful leadership, social media, artificial intelligence, public-private partnerships, and community engagement. The Vice President met with these YSEALI delegates to recognize their role in advancing ASEAN centrality and the United States' commitment to young leaders and the future of Southeast Asia. 2023 marks the 10th anniversary of YSEALI, a leadership development and networking program for youth in Southeast Asia. YSEALI programs focus on civic engagement, economic empowerment, education, and environmental issues. The United States also engages with ASEAN member countries through high school, university, and professional and cultural exchange programs, grants, and more. It has awarded grants to alumni of exchange programs, runs programs at American Spaces in ASEAN countries, and has nominated students, researchers, and professionals for U.S. government-funded programs. The United States also supports partnerships between U.S. and Southeast Asian scholars, universities, entrepreneurs, and business leaders.
