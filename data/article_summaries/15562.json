President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 26, 2015, as National Public Lands Day in the United States. This day is an opportunity for people from all over the country to come together and help preserve the natural spaces in all 50 states. It is the largest volunteer event for public lands in America and allows individuals to play an active role in safeguarding these treasures for future generations. The proclamation also highlights initiatives such as Every Kid in a Park, which provides fourth graders and their families with free admission to National Parks and other federal lands, and the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, which aims to expand access to and restore vibrant landscapes. The proclamation emphasizes the economic benefits of scenic sites, as almost 300 million visitors to National Parks spent approximately $16 billion last year, supporting over 275,000 jobs. It encourages all Americans to participate in a day of public service for the lands and emphasizes the importance of being good stewards of the earth and increasing access to outdoor opportunities for all.
