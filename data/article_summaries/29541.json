President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015, will continue beyond April 1, 2020. This is due to the ongoing threat of significant malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from or directed by individuals outside the United States, which pose a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy.
