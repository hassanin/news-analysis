The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, represented by President Joseph Hansen, supports President Obama's plan to put Americans back to work. They believe that the plan, which includes a private fund to rebuild infrastructure, tax cuts for companies that hire workers, and help for the long-term unemployed, is a good start. However, they emphasize that bold leadership is needed from both Republicans in Congress and the business community in order to create jobs that can support a family and rebuild the middle class. They call on Republicans in Congress to support the president's plan and for business leaders to invest in good jobs in America and provide their employees with decent wages and benefits. They believe that the high levels of unemployment and underemployment in the country are a tragedy and that if corporate profits continue to be prioritized over job creation, the country will not fully recover from its economic decline.
