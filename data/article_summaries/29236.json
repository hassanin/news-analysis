The United States Air Force has awarded a contract to The Boeing Company to design and deliver two new presidential aircraft by 2024. These aircraft will replace the current Air Force One planes, which are 31 years old. The contract sets the total price for the replacement aircraft at $3.9 billion, saving taxpayers over $1.4 billion from the initially proposed cost. President Trump has emphasized the need to minimize the cost of replacing Air Force One, and this contract reflects his commitment to protecting taxpayer dollars.
