President Obama honored the recipients of the 2011 Citizens Medal, the nation's second-highest civilian honor. The medal was established in 1969 to recognize American citizens who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens. This year's recipients come from different backgrounds but share a commitment to a cause greater than themselves. They have made significant impacts on their communities, tackling issues such as terrorism, domestic abuse, homelessness, illiteracy, and more. The recipients include individuals who have founded organizations to provide healthcare in post-conflict countries, cleaned up rivers, created programs to help the poor and underserved, provided mental health services to veterans, empowered women to prevent themselves from becoming victims, fought for equal hospital visitation rights, provided relief to those in financial crises, brought music education to underserved areas, supported high-risk service members and their families, and fought illiteracy globally. These recipients have shown dedication, courage, and a commitment to making a difference in the lives of others.
