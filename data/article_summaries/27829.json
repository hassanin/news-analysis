On May 22, 2003, President Donald J. Trump declared a national emergency regarding the reconstruction of Iraq and the restoration of peace and security in the country. This national emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The President states that the obstacles to the reconstruction and stabilization of Iraq continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2003, along with subsequent modifications in executive orders, will continue to be in effect beyond May 22, 2018. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
