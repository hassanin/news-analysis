In a teleconference, a senior administration official provided an update on the call between Presidents Biden and Putin. The call was professional and substantive, lasting over an hour. While there was no fundamental change in the ongoing dynamic, the US believes they have presented ideas that would enhance European security and address some of Russia's concerns. However, it remains unclear whether Russia is interested in pursuing diplomatic solutions or resorting to force. The US is committed to de-escalation through diplomacy but acknowledges the challenges given Russia's actions on the ground. They are intensifying efforts to deter Russia and are prepared to impose severe financial sanctions and export controls. The US is also reducing its diplomatic presence in Kyiv and expressing concern for the safety of Americans in Ukraine. The transatlantic relationship is strong, NATO is purposeful, and Russia is increasingly isolated. If Russia decides to proceed with military action, the damage to Ukraine, European security, and Russia itself will be profound. The two presidents agreed to keep their teams engaged in the coming days. President Biden believes efforts to avert such action should continue. During the call, President Biden brought serious, substantive ideas to the table but prefers not to negotiate publicly. The US does not have full visibility into President Putin's decision-making, but the assessment is based on the continued Russian build-up on the Ukraine border. If Russia escalates, the US will increase support to Ukraine for defense. The specific issues discussed in the call were not disclosed, and no comment was made on the reported close encounter between Russian and American submarines.
