Federal funding will be provided to State and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Albert Lewis has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Further damage assessments may lead to additional designations and assistance.
