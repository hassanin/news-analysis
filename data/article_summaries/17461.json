The article discusses the High Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program in the Minneapolis/St. Paul - Madison - Milwaukee - Chicago corridor. The total funding for the entire corridor is approximately $823 million, and the project will benefit the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois. The project includes upgrading 144 miles of track, building 32 miles of new track, and planning for an additional 275 miles of track. The goal is to establish intercity passenger rail service between Milwaukee and Madison, with stops in Brookfield, Oconomowoc, and Watertown, at speeds of up to 110 mph by 2013. The improvements between Chicago and Milwaukee will also reduce travel time by more than 30 percent and increase maximum speeds from 79 mph to 110 mph. The long-term plan is to enable passengers to travel from Chicago to the Twin Cities at a top speed of 110 mph. The investments in the corridor include station construction, infrastructure enhancements, and signal and track improvements between Chicago and Milwaukee. The Milwaukee-Madison section will see infrastructure upgrades along 80 miles of track, as well as new and refurbished stations and positive train control. Planning and environmental work will also begin to connect the rail line through Wisconsin to Minnesota at speeds of up to 110 mph.
