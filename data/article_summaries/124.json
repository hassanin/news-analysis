This article is a Presidential Determination, specifically Presidential Determination No. 2022-07. The determination is addressed to the Secretary of Defense and pertains to Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. The President determines that the Large Scale Fabrication, Shipbuilding Industrial Base Expansion, and Maritime Workforce Training Pipelines in support of Virginia Class attack submarine production are essential to national defense. The President finds that the United States industry cannot provide these resources in a timely manner without Presidential action. Therefore, the President authorizes purchases, purchase commitments, or other actions under Section 303 of the Act as the most cost-effective and practical alternative method for meeting the need. The President also finds that expanding domestic production capabilities for these supply chains is necessary to prevent a shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability. Consequently, the President waives certain requirements of Section 303 of the Act for the purpose of expanding domestic production capabilities. The President emphasizes the importance of a robust, resilient, and competitive domestic defense industrial base to national security and directs the publication of this determination in the Federal Register. The determination is signed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
