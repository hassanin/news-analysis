The United States and Pakistan have announced a new partnership to advance girls' education in Pakistan. Pakistan has pledged to double funding for education and increase girls' enrollment in school. The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), will commit $70 million to help educate and empower more than 200,000 additional adolescent girls in Pakistan. This will be achieved through various initiatives such as building and rehabilitating schools in conflict and disaster-affected areas, improving the teaching and learning environment, engaging civil society and communities, providing training and scholarships, creating economic opportunities, and championing the cause of adolescent girls' education. This partnership is part of the broader Let Girls Learn initiative launched by the United States to support girls' education worldwide. The partnership between the U.S. and Pakistan is in addition to other country commitments made with the U.S. this year, including South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Japan. These partnerships aim to provide quality education and empower adolescent girls in developing countries.
