On April 28, 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to establish the Interagency Labor Committee for Monitoring and Enforcement. This committee is responsible for coordinating efforts to monitor the implementation and maintenance of labor obligations in Canada and Mexico, as well as monitoring Mexico's labor reform. It will also recommend enforcement actions when necessary. The committee will be co-chaired by the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of Labor, and will include representatives from various government departments and agencies. Each department and agency participating in the committee will bear its own expenses, except for the Department of Labor, which will provide funding for the hotline required under the Act. The order specifies that it does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, and it is subject to applicable law and appropriations. It also states that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
