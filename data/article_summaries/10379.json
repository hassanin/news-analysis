The Obama Administration has announced that the United States will align its anti-personnel landmine (APL) policy outside of the Korean Peninsula with the Ottawa Convention. The Ottawa Convention is an international treaty that prohibits the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of APL. This announcement means that the United States will not use APL outside of the Korean Peninsula and will not assist or encourage others to do so. The United States will also destroy APL stockpiles that are not needed for the defense of South Korea. However, the unique circumstances on the Korean Peninsula prevent the United States from changing its APL policy there at this time. The United States remains committed to the humanitarian goals of the Ottawa Convention and is the largest financial supporter of humanitarian mine action, providing over $2.3 billion in aid since 1993. The United States will continue to support this work and collaborate with Ottawa States Parties and non-governmental organizations to address the humanitarian impact of APL.
