President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 22-28, 2010, as National Safe Boating Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of practicing safe techniques while boating to ensure the well-being of boaters and passengers. It encourages wearing Coast Guard-approved life jackets, taking boating safety courses, being aware of weather conditions, and having necessary safety equipment on board. The proclamation also emphasizes the responsibility of boat operators to keep their passengers safe and avoid boating under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The United States Coast Guard collaborates with boating organizations to raise awareness and teach safe boating practices. The proclamation urges boaters to take advantage of these opportunities to learn and teach others about safe boating habits. The Congress has authorized and requested the President to proclaim the 7-day period before Memorial Day weekend as National Safe Boating Week. The proclamation concludes by urging all Americans who engage in boating activities to observe this occasion by learning more about safe boating practices and participating in boating education.
