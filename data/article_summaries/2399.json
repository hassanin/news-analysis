The Biden administration is taking a clear and strategic approach to the bilateral trade relationship with China. They aim to protect American workers, grow the economy, and create opportunities at home, while ensuring fair competition. The administration has been investing in domestic renewal, supply chain resiliency, and technological edge to maintain American leadership. They have also been working with allies and partners to address China's unfair practices. President Biden emphasizes the importance of direct diplomacy and communication with China. However, they recognize that Beijing is resistant to addressing structural concerns. The administration's focus will be on building resilience, competitiveness, and diversifying markets to limit the impact of China's harmful practices. They plan to approach the trade relationship frankly, directly, and express concerns on behalf of American workers and allies. The administration will build on strengths and change what is not working in the previous approach. They will revisit the Phase One agreement, emphasize China's commitments, and start a targeted tariff-exclusion process. They will also engage with China to ensure compliance and discuss concerns about industrial policies. The administration is not seeking a Phase Two negotiation but will use all available tools to address harms caused by China's unfair trade policies. The timeline for results will depend on China's actions. The exclusion process will be reinstated, and trade policies will be aligned with the administration's priorities.
