President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed July 16 through July 22, 2023, as Captive Nations Week. During this week, the United States reaffirms its support for people around the world who are fighting against oppressive rule and striving for freedom, dignity, and democracy. The proclamation acknowledges that authoritarian forces continue to exist in countries such as Iran, Belarus, Syria, Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, North Korea, and China, which show contempt for the rule of law, democracy, human rights, and truth. The proclamation also highlights Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the Ukrainian people's defense of their sovereignty. The United States stands with those who fight for freedom and supports democratic reformers and human rights defenders globally. The President mentions the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal, which allocates over $400 million to defend and strengthen democratic resilience, and commits an additional $690 million to advance democracy internationally. The United States aims to lead by example and has taken action to restore and strengthen democracy domestically, including promoting access to voter registration and election information and combating voter suppression. President Biden calls on Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The proclamation concludes by honoring the resilience of those living in darkness and affirming the commitment to championing liberty and justice for all.
