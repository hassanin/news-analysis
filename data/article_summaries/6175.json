The article discusses President Joseph R. Biden's transmission of an alternative plan for pay adjustments for civilian Federal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay systems in January 2024. The President is authorized to implement alternative plans for pay adjustments if they view the increases as inappropriate due to a national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare. President Biden has determined that for 2024, the across-the-board base pay increase will be 4.7 percent and locality pay increases will average 0.5 percent, resulting in an overall average increase of 5.2 percent for civilian Federal employees. This decision aims to attract, recruit, and retain a skilled workforce with fair compensation in order to keep the government running and meet the nation's challenges. The adjustment will take effect on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2024.
