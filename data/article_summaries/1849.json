The U.S. Government has released a progress report on the implementation of President Joe Biden's Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the World. The report highlights the U.S. commitment to promoting and protecting the rights of LGBTQI+ people through diplomacy and foreign assistance. It outlines various actions taken by federal agencies, including combating the criminalization of LGBTQI+ status or conduct abroad, protecting vulnerable LGBTQI+ refugees and asylum seekers, ensuring foreign assistance promotes non-discrimination, responding to human rights abuses, building international coalitions, rescinding inconsistent policies, advancing inclusive democracy, and reducing bias-motivated violence. These efforts aim to make equality the centerpiece of U.S. diplomacy and demonstrate the belief that LGBTQI+ rights are human rights.
