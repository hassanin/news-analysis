President Biden's comprehensive strategy to reduce gun violence was highlighted in his State of the Union address. The strategy includes providing $350 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to cities, counties, and states for hiring more police and investing in community violence intervention. The administration has taken aggressive executive actions to address gun violence, including cracking down on "ghost guns." Congress is urged to take further action to tackle the ongoing gun violence epidemic. The White House has a dedicated gun violence prevention team, led by Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, and a multi-faceted team of experts working on the issue. The strategy encompasses five key components and involves coordination with various government agencies. The approach aims to bridge policy gaps and prioritize issues such as community violence intervention, safe storage, veterans' mental health, job training, and healthcare support. The team works closely with counterparts in agencies and engages with survivors, experts, and policymakers. The comprehensive strategy has already achieved significant progress through executive action and funding allocations. President Biden will continue to implement the strategy, call on Congress to enact additional measures, and increase investments in community policing and violence intervention to save lives.
