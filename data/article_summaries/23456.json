President Obama has signed a declaration stating that a major disaster exists in the State of Alaska. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following a severe storm that occurred from December 12-15, 2015. Federal funding will be available for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in the Pribilof Islands Regional Education Attendance Area. Funding will also be available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Sharon Loper has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
