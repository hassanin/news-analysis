President Donald J. Trump has issued a memorandum regarding the submission of reports on the economic impacts of trade agreements on small businesses. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 requires these reports to be submitted to Congress within 180 days of convening an Interagency Working Group for the relevant trade agreement. However, to avoid disruption to ongoing negotiations, President Trump has directed that the submission of each report be delayed until after the negotiation is concluded, but no later than 30 days after the trade agreement is signed. The reports must be submitted to Congress no later than 45 days before the Senate or the House of Representatives acts to approve or disapprove the trade agreement. The memorandum also authorizes the publication of this directive in the Federal Register.
