President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of California and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in areas affected by wildfires starting on September 4, 2020. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Fresno, Los Angeles, Madera, Mendocino, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Siskiyou. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency protective measures on a cost-sharing basis for State, tribal, local governments, and certain private nonprofit organizations in the designated counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are eligible for Federal funding on a cost-sharing basis as well. Willie G. Nunn has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by calling the designated toll-free telephone numbers. The FEMA News Desk can be contacted for further information.
