President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring September 2012 as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. Prostate cancer is a common cancer among men in the United States, and it continues to have a devastating impact on many lives. The causes of prostate cancer are still unknown, but certain risk factors, such as age and family history, increase the likelihood of developing the disease. African American men are particularly affected by prostate cancer, experiencing both the highest incidence and mortality rates. The Affordable Care Act provides support for patients by preventing insurance companies from placing limits on essential health benefits and from dropping coverage when people get sick. It also prohibits discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. The administration will continue to support research for better treatments and prevention techniques. The proclamation encourages all citizens, organizations, and businesses to participate in activities that increase awareness and prevention of prostate cancer.
