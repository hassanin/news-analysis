President Biden has appointed Mitch Landrieu as a senior advisor to oversee the implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Landrieu will be responsible for coordinating the historic bipartisan infrastructure law, which includes significant investments in American infrastructure, job creation, economic competitiveness, supply chain strengthening, and long-term inflation control. His role will involve overseeing investments in roads, bridges, rail, ports, airports, mass transit, clean energy, climate resilience, clean water, and high-speed internet access for all Americans. Landrieu's experience as the former Mayor of New Orleans, where he successfully led the city's recovery from Hurricane Katrina and secured federal funding for critical infrastructure, makes him well-suited for this position. He also has experience at the state level as the former Lt. Governor of Louisiana and has strong relationships with business and labor communities. Landrieu expressed gratitude for the opportunity and emphasized the importance of partnerships and achieving the President's goals of combating climate change and advancing equity.
