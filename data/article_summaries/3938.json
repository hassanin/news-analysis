The Biden Administration has released an updated COVID-19 Global Response and Recovery Framework. The first framework was released in July 2021 when the world was experiencing high COVID-19 death rates and vaccine shortages. Since then, the United States has led the global fight against COVID-19 by donating over 620 million vaccine doses to 116 countries for free. Global vaccinations have helped avert nearly 20 million deaths in 2021, with almost 70% of the world's population now vaccinated. However, inequities in vaccine access persist, and there is still work to be done in ensuring equitable access to vaccines, tests, treatments, and oxygen. The global health security architecture also needs improvement to better respond to future variants and pandemic threats. The updated Framework aims to minimize COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, integrate COVID-19 response into existing health systems, and strengthen global readiness for future pandemics. The goals include vaccinating high-risk and hard-to-reach populations, scaling and integrating testing and treatment, and preparing for future variants and threats. The objective is to achieve an equitable global recovery and ensure the economic well-being and security of people worldwide.
