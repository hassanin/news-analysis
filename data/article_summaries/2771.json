The article is about an executive order issued by President Biden to advance equity and equal opportunity for all individuals, particularly those who have historically been underserved, marginalized, and affected by poverty and inequality. The order emphasizes the importance of addressing systemic barriers and disparities in laws, policies, institutions, and public and private sectors. It calls for a comprehensive approach to embedding fairness in decision-making processes and requires agencies to assess their programs and policies to identify and redress inequities. The order also highlights the economic benefits of closing racial gaps and aims to provide everyone with the opportunity to reach their full potential. It establishes the Domestic Policy Council to coordinate equity efforts across the federal government and calls for the development of assessment tools, allocation of resources to underserved communities, and promotion of equitable delivery of government benefits and opportunities. The order also emphasizes engagement with underserved communities and the establishment of an Equitable Data Working Group to gather data necessary for measuring and advancing equity. It revokes previous executive orders related to race and sex stereotyping and the President's Advisory 1776 Commission. The order is implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
