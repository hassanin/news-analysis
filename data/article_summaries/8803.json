New data reveals that over 100,000 lives were lost to the overdose epidemic in the United States from April 2020 to April 2021. Despite the focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important not to overlook this issue. The administration is committed to addressing addiction and ending the overdose epidemic. Nearly $4 billion has been allocated through the American Rescue Plan to strengthen and expand services for substance use disorder and mental health. Efforts are being made to make health coverage more accessible and affordable, strengthen prevention, promote harm reduction, expand treatment, support people in recovery, and reduce the supply of harmful substances. The administration wants to assure families and individuals affected by addiction that they are not alone, and together, they will work to turn the tide on this epidemic.
