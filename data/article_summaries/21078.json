The Presidentâ€™s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities (PCAH) has announced the expansion of its Turnaround Arts program. This program is designed to help improve low-performing schools, narrow the achievement gap, and increase student engagement through the arts. The program is funded through a public-private partnership, providing over $5 million over the next three years from the U.S. Department of Education, the National Endowment of the Arts, the Ford Foundation, and other private foundations and companies. The money will be used to hire new arts and music teachers, bring teaching artists, art supplies, and music instruments into schools, and support arts integration into other core subjects. The program will be working in 35 schools across various states, with plans to expand to up to 60 schools across the country. Studies have shown that when students participate in the arts, they are more likely to be recognized for academic achievement, have higher GPA/SAT scores, and are more engaged and cooperative with teachers and peers. The program has already shown improved academic performance, increased student and parent engagement, and improved culture and climate in pilot schools. The expanded program will provide training and resources to address the individual needs of each participating school. Participating artists will also work with students, schools, and communities to highlight their success.
