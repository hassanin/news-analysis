The Biden-Harris Administration has announced the availability of nearly $11 billion in grants and loans to support rural energy and utility providers in bringing affordable, reliable clean energy to their communities. This program represents the largest investment in rural electrification since the 1936 Rural Electrification Act. The funding was announced by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack at a White House event and has received praise from members of Congress, rural electric cooperatives, and climate and environmental groups. The funds aim to reduce energy costs, create jobs, improve air quality, and support the transition to renewable energy sources in rural areas.
