President Joseph R. Biden has declared a major disaster in the State of California due to wildfires that began on July 14, 2021. This declaration allows for federal funding to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. The assistance provided includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid individuals and business owners affected by the disaster. Federal funding is also available for emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation statewide. Andrew Grant has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated in the future. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance starting tomorrow through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling FEMA.
