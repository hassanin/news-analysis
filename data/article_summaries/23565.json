President Barack Obama has proclaimed November 16 through November 22, 2009, as National Entrepreneurship Week. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the important role that American entrepreneurs have played in driving innovation and shaping the future. He recognizes entrepreneurs as the engine of job creation and highlights the need to support them with the necessary tools and resources to succeed. The Obama Administration is working towards providing opportunities and conditions for entrepreneurs to thrive, such as increasing loan guarantees, reducing borrowing fees, and making the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit permanent. The recently formed Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the Department of Commerce is also implementing new policies and initiatives to foster creativity and turn ideas into employment-generating businesses. The President calls upon all Americans to recognize the contributions of entrepreneurs to the economy.
