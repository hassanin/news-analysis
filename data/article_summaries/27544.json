President Donald Trump has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, stating his intention to terminate Turkey's designation as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. Trump believes that Turkey's level of economic development is no longer in line with the criteria for GSP designation. He points to Turkey's economic growth, increased Gross National Income per capita, declining poverty rates, and export diversification as evidence of its increased economic development. He also mentions that Turkey has graduated from other developed countries' GSP programs. Trump assures that the United States is committed to fair and reciprocal trade with Turkey.
