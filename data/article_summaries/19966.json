This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe. The national emergency was declared on March 6, 2003, by President Obama, in response to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons that threatened the foreign policy of the United States. These actions and policies included undermining Zimbabwe's democratic processes, causing political violence and intimidation, and creating political and economic instability in the southern African region. The President issued Executive Orders in 2005 and 2008 to further address the national emergency and block the property of individuals involved in undermining democratic processes, committing human rights abuses, and engaging in public corruption. The President has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, as these individuals still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
