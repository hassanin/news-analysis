The White House has released a statement criticizing the Ryan Republican budget, saying that it prioritizes tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires while making deep cuts to important programs like Medicare. The statement argues that the budget would give every millionaire an average tax cut of $150,000, while still allowing taxpayer subsidies for oil companies and breaks for hedge fund managers. It also claims that the budget's discretionary cuts would negatively impact students, clean energy programs, Head Start, and medical research. The statement concludes by saying that the President has proposed a balanced plan to reduce the deficit by asking the wealthiest to pay more, making responsible spending cuts, and investing in programs to grow the economy and support the middle class and seniors. It argues that the Ryan Republican budget fails to meet this standard.
