Seniors groups, including AARP, the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, and the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long Term Care, are opposing the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). They argue that the ACA includes vital provisions that benefit older Americans, such as assistance with prescription drug costs and improvements in long-term care. These groups believe that repealing the ACA would take away important protections and benefits for seniors and their families. They urge Congress to vote against repeal and implement the law to improve the health and security of older adults.
