Jill and the writer extend their best wishes to Muslim communities as they celebrate Eid al-Fitr and conclude the holy month of Ramadan. Eid al-Fitr is a festive celebration where Muslims feast, decorate their homes, give gifts, wear new clothes, and visit family and friends. The writer is moved by the generosity shown by families providing food and charity to those in need through Zakat-al-Fitr. Eid al-Fitr marks the completion of a month dedicated to devotion, charity, and reflection. The writer also remembers Muslim communities enduring conflict, poverty, hunger, disease, and displacement. They encourage building peace and standing up for the rights and dignity of all people. The administration is committed to addressing hate, including Islamophobia, and has established a task force to tackle these challenges. The White House celebrates Eid al-Fitr to honor inspiring Muslim Americans contributing to the country in various fields. The writer wishes everyone a happy and blessed Eid al-Fitr.
