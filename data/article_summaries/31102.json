The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director, Jim Carroll, commended the Chinese government for convicting multiple suspects involved in the production and trafficking of illicit drugs, including fentanyl and its analogues. Carroll attributed this action to President Trump's strong leadership on the issue and the efforts of Congress members to communicate the US government's commitment to saving American lives. In a meeting in December 2018, President Xi of China agreed to designate fentanyl-related substances as Controlled Substances, subjecting offenders to maximum penalties under Chinese law. Director Carroll also secured commitments from China in September 2019 to further crack down on illicit fentanyl production and trafficking through various measures, such as law enforcement cooperation meetings, improved detection capabilities, and joint investigations.
