This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism. The national emergency was originally declared by President George W. Bush in 2001, following the terrorist attacks on September 11th. The actions of individuals involved in terrorism are still considered a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, President Barack Obama has decided to continue the national emergency for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
