President Obama has increased the level of federal funding for Public Assistance projects in the State of New York in response to Hurricane Sandy. The President has authorized an increase in the federal share for Public Assistance, including direct federal assistance, to 90 percent of the total eligible costs, with the exception of assistance previously authorized at 100 percent federal funding. This amendment to the disaster declaration aims to provide additional support to the state in its recovery efforts.
