President Biden is traveling to Dearborn, Michigan to visit the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center. He will meet with Ford's leadership and United Auto Worker members to tour a factory floor that manufactures electric vehicles. The President will deliver remarks about the American Jobs Plan and how it will help the U.S. lead the electric vehicle market. Currently, the U.S. market share of EV sales is one third the size of the Chinese EV market, and the President aims to change that with a $174 billion investment in the American Jobs Plan. The focus of the trip is to highlight the future of electric vehicles and the importance of the industry for job creation and global competition. In regards to the situation in the Middle East, President Biden supports a ceasefire and is engaged in quiet, intensive diplomacy to work towards ending the violence and suffering of both the Israeli and Palestinian people. The White House is not supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an end to the fighting as they believe their role is to ensure that every action taken is towards the goal of ending the violence. The White House is also working towards a two-state solution for a long-term peaceful outcome. The President's trip to Michigan is part of his efforts to promote the American Jobs Plan and electric vehicle industry. He believes that electric vehicles are the future of the auto industry and a key component of job creation. The White House is prioritizing equity in distributing COVID-19 vaccines to other countries and will provide more details in the coming days. The President will also be addressing the January 6th commission and supports the efforts to create a bipartisan commission to investigate the events and prevent similar incidents in the future. The President will be delivering remarks at the Coast Guard Academy commencement, where he will discuss the important role of the Coast Guard in economic and national security.
