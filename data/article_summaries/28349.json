President Donald J. Trump had a productive meeting with more than 30 members of the House Freedom Caucus to discuss the momentum toward repealing and replacing Obamacare. The caucus members thanked the President for engaging with them throughout the negotiations, while the President thanked them for their willingness to work closely with the White House and Congress to create the strongest possible bill. The group's ultimate goal is to implement a healthcare system that reduces costs and increases access for millions of Americans. This meeting was seen as a positive step toward achieving that goal. The President will also be meeting with the Tuesday Group later in the day to further discuss efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.
