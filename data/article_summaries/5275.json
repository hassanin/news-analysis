The Trade and Technology Council (TTC) held its first meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 29, 2021. It was launched by President Joe Biden, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Charles Michel at the U.S.-EU Summit in June 2021. The U.S. Co-Chairs, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai, were joined by EU Co-Chairs European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis. The purpose of the council is to establish common principles and update the rules for a modern economy. The United States and the EU, with a combined population of 780 million, aim to work together to achieve shared economic growth that benefits working families, farmers, ranchers, and businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The council will focus on various areas such as digital tools for SMEs, securing critical supply chains, emerging technology standards, climate and clean tech objectives, data governance, technology platforms, ICT security, and addressing technology misuse that threatens security and human rights. The inaugural meeting also included engagement with stakeholders from various sectors, and there are plans for continued robust engagement with industry, labor organizations, think tanks, non-profit organizations, environmental groups, academics, and other civil society members.
