On April 30, 2009, the White House released a statement from the President praising the House passage of H.R.627, the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights. The President commended Representatives Barney Frank, Carolyn Maloney, and Luis Gutierrez for their leadership in protecting American consumers. The statement emphasized the importance of fair and transparent rules set by credit card companies and highlighted the President's long-standing support for strong consumer protections, plain language credit card forms and statements, tools to help people make informed choices, and increased monitoring, enforcement, and penalties. The President expressed his commitment to working with Congress to sign a credit card reform bill into law that upholds these principles and protects the interests of the American people.
