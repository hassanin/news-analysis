President Biden's Build Back Better Agenda, unveiled one year ago, aims to address the challenges facing the country, including the pandemic, economic downturn, climate crisis, and racial injustices. The agenda includes the American Families Plan and elements of the American Jobs Plan. It focuses on creating jobs, cutting taxes, and lowering costs for working families.

The agenda proposes lower child care costs, ensuring that no middle-class family pays more than 7% of their income for child care and making universal preschool available. It also includes 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.

In terms of higher education, the agenda offers two years of free community college, increases the maximum Pell Grant award, and invests in subsidized tuition for low- and middle-income students. It also aims to lower prescription drug costs by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices.

The Build Back Better Agenda seeks to reduce health care costs by lowering insurance premiums, adding dental, vision, and hearing coverage to Medicare, and expanding home care for older and disabled Americans. It also addresses the housing crisis by supporting the construction or rehabilitation of affordable and resilient housing.

In terms of tax cuts, the agenda extends the Child Tax Credit expansion, benefiting 39 million households and cutting child poverty in half. It also increases the Earned-Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers.

The agenda aims to create jobs through investments in workforce training, clean energy, and infrastructure. It also focuses on improving education by addressing teacher shortages, expanding free school meals, and upgrading school infrastructure.

Overall, President Biden's Build Back Better Agenda seeks to build a more sustainable, resilient, equitable, and prosperous future for America.
