This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama called "Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces." The order aims to increase efficiency and cost savings in government contracts by ensuring that contractors understand and comply with labor laws. It requires agencies to include provisions in solicitations that require contractors to disclose any violations of labor laws within the preceding 3-year period. Contractors must also require their subcontractors to disclose any violations. The order establishes the role of Labor Compliance Advisors within agencies to promote labor law compliance and provide assistance to contractors. It also requires agencies to ensure that contractors provide individuals with information about their hours worked, pay, and deductions in each pay period. The order further prohibits contractors from requiring employees or independent contractors to arbitrate certain claims without their voluntary consent. The Federal Acquisition Regulation Council is tasked with proposing amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement the order. The order became effective immediately and applies to all solicitations for contracts as set forth in any final rule issued by the FAR Council.
