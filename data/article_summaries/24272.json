This article provides background information on the President's bill signing ceremony for the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The ceremony took place at the Ronald Reagan Building and was attended by nearly 400 individuals who played a key role in passing the legislation. Among the attendees were consumer advocates, business leaders, state and local officials, members of Congress, and Americans who will be impacted by the reform. Two individuals, Andrew Giordano and Robin Fox, shared their stories on stage. Giordano, a retired Vietnam veteran, had been charged hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees because his bank had enrolled him in "overdraft" protection without his consent. The new Consumer Protection Bureau will enforce rules on overdraft programs to ensure that consumers have a choice and are not charged unnecessary fees. Fox, a 7th grade science teacher, experienced a retroactive increase in her credit card interest rate, causing financial difficulties for her family. The new Consumer Protection Bureau will enforce the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which prohibits arbitrary rate hikes on existing balances and other unfair practices by credit card companies. The article also lists the stage participants and expected attendees at the signing ceremony.
