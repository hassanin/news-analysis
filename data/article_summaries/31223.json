According to a report from the Council of Economic Advisers, the U.S. labor market is currently the strongest it has been in 50 years. The report attributes these gains to President Trump's pro-growth economic policies, which have disproportionately benefited traditionally disadvantaged Americans who were left behind during the economic recovery. The report highlights that job creation has surged, leading to more job openings than unemployed people for the first time since data collection began in 2000. The unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in 50 years, and unemployment rates for disadvantaged groups, such as African Americans and Hispanics, have reached historic lows. Since the 2016 election, the economy has added over 7 million jobs, far exceeding predictions. Wage growth has also been strong, with annual nominal wage growth at or above 3 percent for 16 consecutive months. Importantly, wage growth for disadvantaged groups is now higher than for more advantaged groups, contributing to reduced income inequality. These economic gains have resulted in fewer people living in poverty and a decrease in enrollment in public assistance programs. The report also mentions the Opportunity Zones provision created by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a means to drive investment and increase economic activity in economically depressed areas, benefiting the disadvantaged. The Trump Administration plans to launch initiatives to further increase economic opportunity by removing barriers to work and addressing issues like worker training, occupational licensing, child care costs, opioid addiction, and job opportunities for those leaving incarceration. The report concludes that additional deregulatory actions targeted at labor market barriers will lead to further employment and income gains, particularly for disadvantaged groups.
