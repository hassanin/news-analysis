The article discusses the difference in tax approaches between President Biden and Congressional Republicans. President Biden is focused on providing tax cuts for the middle class and ensuring that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share. His plan includes new minimum taxes for billionaires and large corporations, while not raising taxes on anyone making less than $400,000. In contrast, Congressional Republicans are proposing tax increases on middle-class families and continuing tax benefits for the rich and corporations. Their plan would increase middle-class taxes by an average of nearly $1,500 and eliminate Social Security and Medicare. President Biden's plan aims to make corporations and billionaires pay their fair share and deliver tax relief to the middle class. This includes requiring the wealthiest households to pay a minimum of 20% on all income and repealing the 2017 Republican tax cuts for the rich. He also wants to implement a 15% corporate minimum tax and increase the corporate tax rate to 28%. The President believes that profitable corporations should not pay less tax than middle-class families and should not be able to avoid taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. He is also fighting for continued middle-class tax relief through various tax credits. On the other hand, Congressional Republicans are proposing $100 billion per year in tax increases on middle-class families, while not raising taxes for the wealthy or corporations. This would result in around 75 million American families, mostly making less than $100,000, paying an average of $1,480 more in taxes each year. The Republican plan also calls for expiring all laws, including Social Security and Medicare, after 5 years, which the President opposes. The article concludes by stating that the choice is clear on Tax Day, with President Biden fighting for middle-class tax relief and fairness, while Congressional Republicans are pushing for tax increases on the middle class and threatening the future of Social Security and Medicare.
