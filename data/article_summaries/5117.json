The U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security met to discuss the implementation of the Joint Statement by Presidents Biden and Von der Leyen, which aims to diversify the EU's natural gas supplies and reduce consumption. The Task Force discussed policy approaches, energy savings, clean energy technologies, and decoupling from Russian energy. They condemned Russia's aggression on Ukraine and its attacks on civilian energy infrastructure. The EU and the United States will continue to provide emergency energy assistance to Ukraine and other affected countries. Russia's war against Ukraine and its weaponization of energy resources pose significant challenges to global energy security. The EU and the United States are committed to accelerating the clean energy transition and reducing dependence on gas and fossil fuels. They welcomed the increase in LNG supplies to Europe and committed to maintaining high levels of LNG supplies in 2023. They also discussed measures to reduce natural gas demand and improve energy efficiency. Both sides will step up efforts to reduce methane emissions in the fossil energy sector. They plan to reduce flaring, venting, and leakage in oil and gas value chains and align with internationally accepted standards. They will also lead global efforts to reduce methane emissions worldwide.
