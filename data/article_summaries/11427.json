The White House has released its fiscal year 2017 budget proposal. The budget includes a number of priorities, such as cybersecurity, cancer research, and fighting the opioid epidemic, that have bipartisan support. The budget also proposes $277 billion in tax cuts for middle-class families, while curbing tax breaks for high-income households. The budget aims to stabilize federal debt as a share of the economy and keep deficits below 3 percent of GDP through the entire 10-year period. The budget also includes proposals to increase investments in education, job training, and infrastructure. The President has invited Republican leaders to discuss these proposals, but the budget hearing has been cancelled by Republicans on the Budget Committee.
