The joint statement by the Presidents of the United States and Russia highlights the importance of cooperation in the field of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs). They recognize the progress made in ICTs and the threats they pose, including political-military, criminal, and terrorist threats. To enhance bilateral understanding and safeguard national security, they have established a communication channel for information sharing between their computer emergency response teams. They have also authorized the use of a direct communications link between their Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers to exchange urgent communications and reduce the risk of conflict. Additionally, they have directed officials to establish a direct communication link between high-level officials to manage potentially dangerous situations related to ICT security threats. A bilateral working group on ICT threats in the context of international security will be created to assess emerging threats, propose joint measures, and strengthen confidence. The statement emphasizes the importance of these steps in promoting peaceful and just conduct in the use of ICTs and mentions plans for continued dialogue and cooperation in combating ICT threats.
