The article is a statement by White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer regarding the contempt vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. Pfeiffer criticizes Republicans for prioritizing investigations into the Obama Administration instead of focusing on the country's major economic challenges. He mentions that the issue of gunwalking began during the George W. Bush Administration and it was Attorney General Eric Holder who ended it. Pfeiffer argues that Holder has been an excellent Attorney General and that there is no evidence suggesting he knew about the misguided tactics used in this operation. He states that the Justice Department has cooperated with Congressional investigators, providing thousands of pages of documents and testifying at multiple hearings. Pfeiffer concludes by accusing Republicans of engaging in political theater instead of working with the President to create jobs and grow the economy.
