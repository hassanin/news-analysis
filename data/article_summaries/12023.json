The United States has welcomed the signing of declarations ending the M23 rebellion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This is seen as a step towards ending decades of violence in the African Great Lakes region. However, there is still much work to be done, including disarming and demobilizing the M23, holding accountable those responsible for war crimes, and resolving the underlying causes of conflict through regional dialogue. The US commends the parties involved and Ugandan President Museveni for his role in bringing the Kampala Dialogue to a successful close. The US and the international community will continue to support the countries of the region in their efforts towards peace and progress.
