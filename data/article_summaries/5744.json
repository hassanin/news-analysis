President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed November 14-20, 2021, as National Apprenticeship Week in the United States. The proclamation highlights the importance of Registered Apprenticeships in providing training and opportunities for workers to enter or re-enter the workforce. Apprenticeships are seen as a critical talent pipeline and a means to address pressing challenges such as infrastructure rebuilding and cybersecurity threats. The Biden administration supports the expansion of Registered Apprenticeships and aims to invest in high-quality job training in sectors like healthcare, child care, advanced manufacturing, information technology, and clean energy. The administration has also awarded grants and invested in technical assistance centers to facilitate the expansion of apprenticeship programs, particularly for underrepresented groups such as women, youths, people of color, rural communities, justice-involved individuals, and people with disabilities. The proclamation emphasizes the need to ensure historically underserved populations have equal opportunities to participate in the workforce. The goal is to build a successful, competitive, and diverse workforce through strengthened Registered Apprenticeships.
