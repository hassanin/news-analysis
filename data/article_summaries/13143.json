Dr. Christina Romer, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, has announced her plans to step down from her position and return to the University of California, Berkeley. Her decision is driven by her desire to be closer to her family, as her son will be starting high school in California. As CEA chair, Dr. Romer has played a crucial role in advising President Obama on economic matters during the recession. The President expressed his gratitude for her service and stated that she will continue to offer her insights and advice as a member of his Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Dr. Romer has been instrumental in providing analysis on economic developments, including the effects of healthcare reform and advocating for additional measures to support the recovery and help the unemployed.
