On Ash Wednesday, Christians worldwide begin the season of Lent, a time for repentance and renewal. Amidst difficult times, we hold families with empty seats in our hearts and pray for those facing hardships. We seek strength in one another and find purpose in our faith. As we look towards Easter, we hold hope for brighter days ahead.
