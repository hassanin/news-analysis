The White House has issued an executive order imposing sanctions on individuals involved in human rights abuses and corruption in Venezuela. The executive order authorizes the imposition of sanctions against individuals responsible for erosion of human rights guarantees, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, use of violence in human rights violations, and significant public corruption by senior officials in Venezuela. The executive order does not target the people or economy of Venezuela, but rather focuses on specific individuals. The order freezes the assets of these individuals and prohibits US persons from doing business with them. The sanctions are intended to shine a light on the abuse of human rights and corruption in Venezuela and encourage the Venezuelan government to change its ways. The US remains committed to maintaining strong ties with the people of Venezuela and is open to improving its relationship with the Venezuelan government.
