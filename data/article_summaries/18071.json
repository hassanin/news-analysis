President Obama issued an Executive Order to address the threat posed by malicious cyber actors who seek to harm critical infrastructure, damage computer systems, and steal trade secrets or sensitive information. The Executive Order creates a new authority for the U.S. government to respond to these threats, particularly in situations where malicious cyber actors operate beyond the reach of existing authorities. The order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to impose sanctions on individuals or entities engaged in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities that pose a threat to national security, foreign policy, or economic health. The order also allows for sanctions on those who knowingly use stolen trade secrets or assist in the above harms. The U.S. will employ all available means, including diplomatic and law enforcement mechanisms, to counter these threats.
