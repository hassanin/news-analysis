On May 22, 2003, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the threat posed by obstacles to the reconstruction, peace, and security in Iraq. The national emergency, initially declared in 2003, has been extended multiple times and is now set to continue beyond May 22, 2023. The declaration is based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and is aimed at addressing the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. President Biden's decision to extend the national emergency for one year was made in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and requires publication in the Federal Register and transmission to Congress.
