The article discusses the expansion of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which was established in 2006 to protect and preserve the marine area of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The expansion includes the waters and submerged lands west of 163° West Longitude, extending from the boundaries of the existing monument. The area contains significant geological and biological resources, including seamounts, ridges, and deep-sea ecosystems with unique biodiversity. It is home to a diverse range of species, including coral, fish, birds, marine mammals, and sea turtles. The area also holds cultural significance for the Native Hawaiian community. The article mentions the importance of the monument for scientific research and conservation efforts, as well as the management responsibilities of the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior. Prohibited activities in the monument expansion include energy development, introducing non-native species, damaging resources, and commercial fishing. However, native Hawaiian practices, research, education, and non-commercial fishing are permitted under certain conditions. The article also states that the U.S. Armed Forces are exempt from some of the prohibitions, and the monument expansion does not affect the jurisdiction of the State of Hawaii.
