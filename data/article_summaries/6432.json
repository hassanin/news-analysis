Leif Erikson Day is celebrated on October 9th to honor the contributions of Nordic-Americans to the United States. Leif Erikson, the son of Iceland and grandson of Norway, is believed to be the first European to set foot on North America over 1,000 years ago. The spirit of Leif Erikson and his crew, characterized by restlessness, boldness, bravery, and optimism, inspired generations of Danes, Finns, Icelanders, Norwegians, and Swedes to immigrate and build new lives in America.

Nordic-Americans have made significant contributions to various fields, including business, philanthropy, education, art, invention, healthcare, and public service. They have played vital roles in strengthening the fabric of the nation and bringing the promise of America closer to every American.

The proclamation also emphasizes the strong partnerships between the United States and Nordic nations. These partnerships are based on mutual commitments to peace, security, and stability, serving as the foundation for democracy and friendship. The United States Senate's swift ratification of Sweden and Finland's accession protocols to join NATO is highlighted as a means to fortify the defensive alliance and defend democracy and freedom worldwide.

President Joseph R. Biden Jr. calls upon all Americans to celebrate Nordic-American heritage on Leif Erikson Day through appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs. The proclamation is signed on October 7, 2022, acknowledging the contributions of Nordic-Americans and their ongoing impact on the United States.
