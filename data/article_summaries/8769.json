President Biden believes that health care should be a right, not a privilege, and is taking action to lower costs and increase access to affordable health care. The Biden-Harris Administration is cracking down on price gouging and special interests in the pharmaceutical industry. They are promoting competition in health care and supporting efforts to lower prescription drug costs. The administration is releasing a proposed framework for agencies to exercise march-in rights on taxpayer-funded drugs, considering factors such as price to determine accessibility. The goal is to ensure taxpayer-funded medications are reasonably available and affordable. The administration has already taken steps to lower health care costs, such as capping the cost of insulin for seniors and allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices. They are also addressing consolidation in the health care industry, which contributes to higher costs and lower quality of care. The administration is scrutinizing anticompetitive acquisitions and practices and taking action to stop them. These efforts build on past actions to increase competition and lower prescription drug costs.
