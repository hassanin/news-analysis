This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to the Commonwealth and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency protective measures. MaryAnn Tierney has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
