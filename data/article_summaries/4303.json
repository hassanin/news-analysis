Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese met with leaders from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, as well as representatives from labor and the business community, to address congestion issues at the ports. The discussion focused on the possibility of transitioning to 24/7 operations and the commitment of business leaders to move their cargo during off-peak hours. This move is expected to improve truck movement on highways and expedite the drop-off and pick-up of loads at the ports. The meeting also acknowledged the global challenges faced by the transportation and logistics supply chain, including disruptions caused by the delta variant in Southeast Asia. The Biden-Harris Administration is dedicated to resolving short-term disruptions and investing in long-term supply chain resilience. Additionally, participants discussed the significant cargo volume handled by the ports in the past year and emphasized the role of private businesses in the system. They agreed to work together, with the assistance of Port Envoy Porcari, to implement 24/7 operations and find further solutions to alleviate congestion and enhance efficiency. This includes temporary expansion of warehousing and rail service, improved data tools and sharing at the ports, increased recruitment of truck drivers, and improved quality of trucking jobs. The importance of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Build Back Better legislation in strengthening the goods movement system in the US was also highlighted.
