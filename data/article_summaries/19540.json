Reverend T.J. Jemison, a civil rights leader, has passed away. He was known for leading the country's first boycott of segregated seating on public buses 60 years ago and for his efforts in eradicating legal segregation and improving voting rights laws for disenfranchised Americans. Jemison was a founding member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and former president of the National Baptist Convention. He inspired Americans with his courage and faith. As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Justice, we honor the legacy of trailblazers like Jemison and commit ourselves to continuing their work. The nation is better because of Jemison's struggle and sacrifice, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and loved ones.
