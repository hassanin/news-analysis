During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki addressed questions about the United States' response to the situation in Ukraine.

Psaki also stated that the United States is continuing to provide security assistance to the Ukrainian military and intelligence services. She reiterated the United States' support for President Volodymyr Zelensky and condemned Russia's aggression. Psaki declined to comment on specific military actions or hypothetical scenarios.

Psaki also discussed the new federal mask guidelines announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). She stated that the White House is evaluating its protocols in light of the new guidance, but noted that Washington, D.C. currently has a mask mandate until March 1st. Psaki emphasized that the guidance does not mean the end of the pandemic and encouraged people to continue to follow public health measures.

In response to questions about the Supreme Court nomination process, Psaki confirmed that President Biden interviewed three candidates in person and made his final decision to nominate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. She highlighted Judge Jackson's qualifications and bipartisan support in her previous nominations. Psaki also mentioned that Vice President Kamala Harris has been involved in the decision-making process and has reached out to former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.

Regarding the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Psaki stated that the United States is working to build a global coalition to oppose Russia's aggression and that diplomacy with Russia will continue, although no direct communication between President Biden and President Putin is planned at this time. Psaki emphasized that the United States is taking significant actions, including sanctions, to impose consequences on Russia and support Ukraine.

Psaki also addressed questions about the CDC's new guidance on the pandemic and reiterated that the United States is in a stronger position to combat COVID-19 due to vaccination efforts and other tools. She emphasized that the CDC's guidance does not mean the end of the pandemic and that caution should still be exercised.

In response to questions about energy prices, Psaki stated that the President is focused on reducing energy prices but also highlighted the importance of balancing the impact on the Russian economy with the need to minimize the impact on the American people. She mentioned ongoing discussions with other countries about providing natural gas supply to Europe.

Psaki did not provide specific details on the number of Russian casualties in Ukraine or plans for offering Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Ukrainians in the United States. She also declined to comment on specific actions by American companies or the possibility of Iranian oil imports.

Overall, the White House is focused on a range of issues, including the Russia-Ukraine crisis, COVID-19 response, Supreme Court nomination, and energy prices. The President and his administration are taking various actions and engaging in diplomacy to address these challenges.
