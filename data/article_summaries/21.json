Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor to the United States, had a conversation with Yuriy Ushakov, the Foreign Policy Advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin. During the conversation, Sullivan expressed the U.S.'s willingness to engage in diplomatic discussions with Russia through various channels, including bilateral engagement, the NATO-Russia Council, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). However, Sullivan emphasized that any dialogue should be based on reciprocity and address the U.S.'s concerns about Russia's actions. He also stressed the importance of coordinating with European Allies and partners. Sullivan further emphasized that progress can only be achieved in a de-escalated environment rather than an escalated one.
