President Barack Obama expressed his gratitude to the House of Representatives for passing legislation that will use Recovery Act funds to continue the "Cash for Clunkers" program. He praised the program for its success in allowing consumers to trade in their less fuel-efficient cars for more fuel-efficient models, providing a break for consumers and boosting the American auto industry. He emphasized the program's positive environmental impact, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. President Obama urged the Senate to pass the legislation, taking American consumers into consideration.
