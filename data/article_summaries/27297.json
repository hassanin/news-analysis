The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law by President Trump in December 2017 is already benefiting American families, workers, and companies. The tax cuts mean that a typical family of four earning $75,000 a year with two children will see a tax cut of more than $2,000 in 2018. Working Americans will see several tax benefits from the new law, including lower tax rates, a doubling of the child tax credit, and a nearly doubled standard deduction. The benefits also extend to businesses, which now operate under a globally competitive tax system for the first time in decades. Companies are investing and growing in the United States as a result. Over 500 companies have announced that the new tax law is having a favorable impact, resulting in over 5.5 million American workers receiving bonuses, raises, and other benefits. Since President Trump's election, the unemployment rate has dropped to near record lows, GDP growth has reached a sustainable level of almost 3 percent, and almost 3 million jobs have been created. The President continues to hold events with workers, families, and business owners across the country to listen to the needs of the American people. Business owners throughout the country continue to praise tax reform, stating that the savings is allowing them to invest, raise wages, and hire more employees. The American people finally have a tax system that treats them fairly and provides them with new opportunities.
