The Security Governance Initiative (SGI) is a joint effort between the United States and six African countries (Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Tunisia) to improve security sector governance and capacity to address threats in Africa. The initiative aims to address security challenges such as terrorist groups, illicit activities, and domestic and regional conflicts. The United States will provide financial assistance, starting with $65 million in the first year, and additional funding in subsequent years. The SGI will focus on developing joint strategies, conducting regular evaluations, and matching investments with willing partners to strengthen specific military and civilian institutions. The initiative aims to increase partner nation capacity, prevent or mitigate instability and conflict, advance U.S. interests and strategic goals, and deepen the impact of U.S. investments in countries that show leadership and political will for security sector reforms. The specific programs under SGI will vary in each country, based on their unique challenges and objectives. The initiative will focus on civilian and military security institutions and the ministerial functions that provide oversight of the security sector. The goal is to build security sector capacity through sustained leadership commitment from both the United States and partner countries.
