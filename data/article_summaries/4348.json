In a speech at the East Room, President Biden emphasized the need for global cooperation in addressing climate change. He highlighted the fact that climate-related disasters like hurricanes and wildfires do not respect national borders and that instability in one country can have far-reaching effects. The President stressed the importance of mobilizing financing on an unprecedented scale, with the private sector recognizing the job creation potential of climate change solutions. However, he also emphasized that governments must lead in addressing climate risks to financial systems and protecting workers' savings. President Biden called for a shift in policies and public investment, including investing in breakthrough technologies, ending fossil fuel subsidies, and supporting vulnerable nations affected by climate change. He announced that the United States will double its annual public climate financing to developing countries by 2024 and triple its public financing for climate adaptation. The President also highlighted the commitment of the Development Finance Corporation to net-zero emissions by 2040 and increasing climate-focused investments. Additionally, the United States issued its first-ever International Climate Finance Plan, outlining steps to increase the quantity and quality of climate financing and encourage private sector contributions. President Biden concluded by stressing the urgency of the moment and the need for both public and private financing to address climate change and create a more secure world.
