The U.S. District Court has approved a settlement reached between the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Justice, and the plaintiffs in the Keepseagle class action lawsuit. This settlement is an important step in addressing past civil rights issues within the USDA. The approval of the settlement will strengthen the relationship between the government and Native American communities and reaffirm the importance of fair treatment for all citizens. The President thanks Secretary Vilsack and Attorney General Holder for their leadership and hard work on behalf of Native American farmers.
