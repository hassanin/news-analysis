Senior Administration Officials met with New York Governor Kathy Hochul to discuss the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to build a humane and orderly immigration system. They also discussed the support provided to communities housing migrants and asylum seekers. The officials highlighted data showing that a significant number of recent migrants in New York City are work eligible but have not applied for work permits. In September, the Administration plans to work with New York State and New York City on a month-long campaign to encourage eligible noncitizens to apply for work authorization. The campaign will include direct communication in multiple languages. Additionally, federal departments and agencies will take steps to support New York in areas such as health, education, and housing for recent arrivals. The Administration and the Governor expressed their commitment to ongoing conversations and called on Congress to adequately fund programs supporting communities receiving migrants and to pass immigration reform. The Administration has requested an additional $600 million for the Shelter and Services Program in the Supplemental and continues to urge Congress to fulfill that request.
