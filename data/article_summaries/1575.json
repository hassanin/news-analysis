In this speech, Vice President Kamala Harris addresses a gathering at a private residence in Dallas, Texas. She expresses gratitude to the attendees for their support throughout her political journey and emphasizes the importance of staying engaged and active in the political process. Harris highlights the achievements of the Biden administration, including capping the cost of insulin for seniors, allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, passing an infrastructure bill, and reducing child poverty through an extended Child Tax Credit. She also criticizes the actions of certain state leaders who are restricting voting rights, banning books, and limiting women's reproductive rights. Harris encourages the audience to stand up for their beliefs and fight for what is right, reminding them that the measure of strength is based on lifting others up rather than beating them down. She concludes by expressing confidence in the ability to overcome challenges through organizing, unity, and love for the country.
