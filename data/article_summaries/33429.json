President Donald Trump has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, stating his intention to terminate India's status as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. This decision is based on the fact that India has not assured the United States that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets as required by the Trade Act. President Trump will continue to assess whether India meets the eligibility criteria for the GSP program.
