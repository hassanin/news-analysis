In this article, the President expresses his disappointment with Senate Republicans for refusing to give well-qualified nominees to the federal bench the yes-or-no votes they deserve. He mentions that the D.C. Circuit, considered the Nation's second-highest court, has three vacancies that should be filled according to Chief Justice John Roberts and the Judicial Conference of the United States. The President believes that Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard, and Judge Robert Wilkins, who have all received the highest possible rating from the American Bar Association, are highly qualified and have bipartisan support. However, Senate Republicans have blocked all three from receiving a vote. The President views this obstruction as unprecedented and argues that it hinders a fully-functioning judiciary that serves the American people. He calls for simple yes-or-no votes without further obstruction or delay.
