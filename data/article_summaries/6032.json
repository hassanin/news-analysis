1. Ensuring a stable and experienced workforce: The Executive Order aims to maintain a reliable supply of skilled and experienced employees for federal service contracts. This is important for various service work supporting government functions across the country, such as building maintenance, military base services, and equipment operation and maintenance.

2. Job continuity during contract transitions: When a federal service contract changes hands from one contractor to another, the new contractor will be required to offer jobs to qualified employees who performed well under the previous contractor. This helps prevent disruptions in federal services and makes it easier for employers to find workers who are already trained for the job.

3. Savings for taxpayers: By promoting job continuity and reducing turnover, the Executive Order aims to save taxpayer dollars. It ensures that the new contractor can benefit from the expertise and experience of the existing workforce, avoiding the need for extensive training and potential delays in service delivery.

4. Strengthening good-quality, union jobs: This Executive Order is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to improve the efficiency of federal procurement and use taxpayer dollars to support high-quality, union jobs in America. It aligns with previous commitments made by President Biden, such as strengthening Buy American rules and raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 an hour.

5. Building on previous policies: The Executive Order builds on a policy set during the Obama-Biden Administration (E.O. 13495) and further expands the support for service sector workers and the work they do for the American people.
