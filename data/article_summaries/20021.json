President Barack Obama has announced a comprehensive infrastructure plan to extend and renovate roads, railways, and airports in the United States. The plan includes both short-term and long-term investments in infrastructure, with a focus on competitiveness and American innovation. Some of the tangible achievements of the plan include rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, constructing and maintaining 4,000 miles of railways, rehabilitating or reconstructing 150 miles of airport runways, and implementing a NextGen system to reduce delays. The plan also proposes the creation of an Infrastructure Bank to maximize federal funds and prioritize national and regional investments. The President intends to work with Congress to secure funding for the plan and pay for it in full.
