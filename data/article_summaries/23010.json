President Obama addresses the need for Congress to act and avoid harmful automatic cuts called the sequester. He emphasizes the importance of finding a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes investments in areas that promote growth and cuts unnecessary spending. If the sequester is allowed to go forward, it could result in job losses, cuts to important programs, and a negative impact on the economy. The President urges Congress to pass a set of balanced cuts and close tax loopholes instead of putting the burden on seniors and the middle class. He emphasizes the need to continue reducing the deficit in a balanced way and not allow self-inflicted wounds to hinder progress. The President calls on Congress to work together and provide support to workers and businesses for growth and prosperity.
