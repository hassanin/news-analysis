The Biden-Harris Administration has announced that all manufacturers of the ten drugs selected for negotiation have signed agreements to participate in the Inflation Reduction Act's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. This program allows Medicare to directly negotiate lower drug prices, which is a significant step towards lower healthcare costs for seniors and families. These ten drugs accounted for $3.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs for approximately 9 million Medicare enrollees in 2022. The drugs treat various conditions such as heart failure, diabetes, arthritis, cancers, and blood clots. The negotiated prices for these drugs will go into effect in 2026. In the next four years, Medicare will negotiate prices for up to 60 drugs covered under Medicare Part D and Part B, with an additional 20 drugs negotiated every year after that. The Biden Administration's efforts have already resulted in cost savings for seniors, such as reduced out-of-pocket costs for vaccines and capped insulin costs. More provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act will continue to lower prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries in the coming years.
