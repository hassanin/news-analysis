President Biden and President von der Leyen announced a new initiative between the European Union (EU) and the United States to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian energy. The initiative focuses on two core issues: reducing Europe's dependency on Russian gas and reducing overall demand for gas. The United States will work with international partners to ensure an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for Europe this year, and the EU will work to ensure additional EU market demand for 50 billion cubic meters of LNG from the United States annually by 2030. The European Commission will work with member states to store gas, build more infrastructure to receive LNG, and increase the efficiency of gas. The initiative also aims to accelerate the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, invest in clean energy solutions, and advance the use of clean and renewable hydrogen. In addition, the United States and the EU have reached an agreement to enhance data privacy and security for citizens, which will facilitate economic relationships between the EU and the United States. The leaders emphasized the importance of transatlantic unity in upholding fundamental values and rules and expressed their determination to stand up against Russia's actions. They also highlighted the need to support Ukraine and its citizens, address energy security, and work towards a greener future.
