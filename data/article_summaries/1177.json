President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed April 12, 2022, as Education and Sharing Day, USA. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of education in achieving greater opportunity, prosperity, stability, and equality. He praises Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe and leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, for his dedication to global education and his respect for diversity, inclusiveness, and equal justice. The Rebbe's work serves as an example for generations, and his outreach can still be felt today in various communities worldwide. President Biden calls upon all government officials, educators, volunteers, and the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. He also highlights the need for continued investments in education, including access to high-quality preschool for every 3- and 4-year-old in America and addressing the mental health toll on children exacerbated by the pandemic.
