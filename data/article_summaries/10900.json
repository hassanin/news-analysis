On January 23, 1995, President Barack Obama declared a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat posed by foreign terrorists who aim to disrupt the Middle East peace process. This national emergency was modified and clarified through subsequent executive orders in 1998 and 2005. Given that these terrorist activities still pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, President Obama has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This decision will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
