President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 with respect to Ukraine will continue beyond March 6, 2015. The President cites the actions and policies of individuals undermining democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine, as well as the actions and policies of the Russian Government, including the annexation of Crimea and use of force in Ukraine, as threats to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the President has determined it necessary to continue the national emergency.
