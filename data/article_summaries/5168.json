The President and his economic team recently met with economists Dr. Edward Glaeser and Dr. Janet Currie to discuss the economics of infrastructure investment. The meeting focused on the economic benefits of investing in infrastructure, as well as the importance of project selection and efficient implementation. Dr. Glaeser, a professor at Harvard University, briefed the President on these benefits, while Dr. Currie, a professor at Princeton University, discussed the effects of lead exposure on children. Both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the President's Build Back Better plan include significant investments to reduce lead exposure. The President plans to continue meeting with experts and leaders in various fields as he works towards his economic strategy for the American people.
