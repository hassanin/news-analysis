Attorney General Garland and President Biden held a roundtable discussion with local elected officials and law enforcement representatives to address the increase in violent crime in the US. The Justice Department has launched a comprehensive violent crime reduction strategy, focused on strategic enforcement priorities, building trust with communities, investing in prevention and intervention programs, and measuring results. The strategy emphasizes support for state, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners and strengthening the Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative. The Department is also cracking down on illegal firearm trafficking and holding gun dealers accountable for breaking the rules. They will increase ATF's inspection capacity, improve information sharing, and establish new cross-jurisdictional law enforcement strike forces to target firearms trafficking corridors. The Department is providing historic funding to states, cities, and counties for law enforcement and crime prevention, with a focus on hiring police officers, investing in crime-fighting technologies, and supporting community violence intervention programs. President Biden emphasized the need for Congress to pass sensible gun violence prevention legislation, such as background checks, an assault weapons ban, and repealing the liability shield for gun manufacturers. He also called for confirmation of David Chipman as head of the ATF and funding for gun violence research. The President highlighted the bipartisan support for these measures and urged unity in addressing the issue of gun violence.
