On September 30, 2009, President Obama signed a disaster declaration for the State of Kansas. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe storms and flooding that occurred from July 8-14, 2009. The funding will be available to repair or replace damaged facilities, and for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Michael R. Scott has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-4600.
