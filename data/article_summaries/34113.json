On December 20, 2018, the President signed two laws into effect. The first law, H.R. 1918, is called the "Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018." This law imposes sanctions on the government of Nicaragua. The second law, H.R. 5759, is called the "21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act" or "21st Century IDEA." This law requires executive agencies to meet modernization requirements for new Federal websites and digital services. It also requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to identify candidates for digitization of services and mandates executive agencies to develop plans for accelerating the use of electronic signatures.
