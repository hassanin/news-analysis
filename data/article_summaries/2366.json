Vice President Harris and senior Administration officials recently met with CEOs from four American companies involved in AI innovation to discuss concerns about the risks associated with AI. President Biden also attended the meeting and emphasized the responsibility of companies to ensure the safety and security of their AI products before deployment. The meeting focused on mitigating the risks AI poses to individuals, society, and national security, including safety, security, human and civil rights, privacy, jobs, and democratic values. The Administration officials stressed the importance of the CEOs' leadership in promoting responsible behavior and taking action to ensure responsible innovation and appropriate safeguards. Transparency, evaluation of safety and efficacy, and security against attacks were key areas of discussion. The CEOs committed to continuing engagement with the Administration to benefit from AI innovation, and the meeting was part of a broader effort to address critical AI issues by involving various stakeholders. The Administration has already taken steps to promote responsible innovation and risk mitigation in AI, including the announcement of additional actions, the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, the AI Risk Management Framework, and a roadmap for a National AI Research Resource.
