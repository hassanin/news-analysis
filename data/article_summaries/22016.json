On April 3, 2014, the President signed into law H.R. 2019, also known as the "Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act." This law ends the entitlement of national committees of eligible political parties to receive payments from the "Presidential Election Campaign Fund" for presidential nominating conventions. Instead, the funds will be transferred to a new "10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund." This law also authorizes appropriations from the Initiative Fund for grants to be made by the National Institutes of Health for pediatric research.
