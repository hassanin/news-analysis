The article discusses the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was signed into law on July 26, 1990. The ADA is a comprehensive declaration of equality for people with disabilities and has been instrumental in moving the United States closer to equal opportunity and full participation for individuals with disabilities. The legislation prohibits disability discrimination, provides standards for access to public places, protects against workplace discrimination, and ensures equal access to healthcare, social services, transportation, and telecommunications.

The article highlights the impact of the ADA, stating that it has improved the lives of countless Americans and has given generations of people with disabilities the same rights and opportunities as their non-disabled peers. However, it acknowledges that there are still barriers to inclusion and equitable access that need to be addressed.

The Biden administration is committed to advancing equity and equal opportunity for people with disabilities. They have allocated resources to enforce the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., expand access to long-term services and supports, improve accessibility through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, connect disabled Americans to affordable accessible housing, expand employment opportunities, and provide resources for inclusive workplaces.

The administration also recognizes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the disabled community, including health disparities and systemic discrimination. They are working to address these issues while celebrating the legacy of the ADA and renewing their commitment to disability equity, dignity, access, and inclusion.

In conclusion, President Biden proclaims July 26, 2022, as the Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act and encourages Americans to celebrate the 32nd year of this important civil rights law and recognize the contributions of individuals with disabilities to the nation.
