The leaders of Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States have agreed to consult and coordinate with each other to address regional challenges, provocations, and threats that affect their collective interests and security. Through these consultations, the countries aim to share information, align messaging, and coordinate response actions. However, this commitment does not override the existing security commitments between Japan and the United States, as well as between the United States and the Republic of Korea. Additionally, this commitment does not create any new rights or obligations under international or domestic law.
