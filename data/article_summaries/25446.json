President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in Hawaii due to the conditions caused by Hurricane Lane. This declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to save lives and protect property. FEMA is authorized to mobilize resources and equipment as needed, and emergency protective measures will be funded at 75 percent by the federal government. William Roche has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
