President Donald J. Trump ordered a counterterrorism operation in Yemen that successfully killed Qasim al-Rimi, the founder and leader of al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and a deputy to al-Qa'ida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Al-Rimi had been with al-Qa'ida since the 1990s and was responsible for committing violence against civilians in Yemen and planning attacks against the United States and its forces. His death is a significant blow to AQAP and the global al-Qa'ida movement, making the United States and its allies safer. The US will continue to track down and eliminate terrorists to protect its citizens.
