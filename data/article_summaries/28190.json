This article is a proclamation issued by President Donald J. Trump on February 22, 2018. The proclamation aims to modify and continue the ongoing national emergency declared in previous proclamations related to Cuba. It states that a mass migration from Cuba would endanger the security and international relations of the United States. The weak state of the Cuban economy has led to an outflow of its nationals toward the United States and neighboring countries. The policy of the United States is to ensure that engagement with Cuba advances the interests of both countries. The unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States into Cuban territorial waters is in violation of U.S. law and against U.S. policy. The possibility of large-scale unauthorized entries of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters would disturb international relations. The proclamation authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to make and issue rules and regulations to regulate the anchorage and movement of vessels. The Secretary is also authorized to inspect and take control of vessels, with the consent of the President, to secure the rights and obligations of the United States. The Secretary may request assistance from other U.S. departments, agencies, officers, or instrumentalities, as well as seek assistance from State and local authorities. Any provisions of previous proclamations that are inconsistent with this proclamation are superseded. The proclamation is to be transmitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
