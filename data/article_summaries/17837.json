The White House has issued a memorandum by President Barack Obama regarding unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs related to Somalia and food pipeline breaks for refugee and other displaced populations globally. The memorandum states that it is important to the national interest to provide assistance under the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962. An amount not exceeding $33 million from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund will be used to address these urgent needs. The assistance will be provided through contributions to international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, as well as the payment of administrative expenses of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration of the Department of State. The memorandum concludes by authorizing the publication of this information in the Federal Register.
