President Barack Obama will award the Medal of Honor to Private First Class Anthony T. Kaho’ohanohano and Private First Class Henry Svehla for their acts of gallantry. Private First Class Kaho’ohanohano will receive the honor posthumously for his actions during combat in the Republic of Korea in 1951. When faced with an overwhelming enemy, he ordered his squad to take up defensive positions and provide cover fire for the friendly forces. He then returned to his original position alone, firing accurately at the oncoming enemy until he ran out of ammunition. He engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat until he was killed. His bravery inspired his comrades to launch a counterattack that repulsed the enemy. Private First Class Kaho’ohanohano's sister and brother will join the President at the White House to honor their brother's selfless service and sacrifice. Private First Class Svehla will also receive the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions in combat in the Republic of Korea in 1952. He charged the enemy positions, firing his weapon and throwing grenades, even when his platoon's attack was faltering. When an enemy grenade landed among his comrades, he threw himself on it, sacrificing his own life to save others. Private First Class Svehla's sisters will join the President at the White House to commemorate his example of selflessness. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who display exceptional gallantry and risk their lives above and beyond the call of duty in combat. The meritorious conduct must involve great personal bravery or self-sacrifice that distinguishes the individual from their comrades.
