Vice President Joe Biden and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack have announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is providing the first wave of $10 billion in guaranteed housing loans from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to stimulate economic and home ownership opportunities in rural America. The funding aims to create and save 42,500 jobs and provide thousands of families with home ownership opportunities. The funds will be used to provide loan guarantees for homeownership financing, with an initial $1.76 billion going to 15,000 rural families. The ultimate goal is to release $7 billion directly to states and reserve $3 billion for higher need areas. The funding will also support infrastructure projects and provide operating loans to farmers and ranchers in rural communities. The housing programs of the USDA are designed to improve the quality of life for rural Americans by ensuring access to safe, affordable homes. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 aims to jumpstart the nation's economy, create or save jobs, and address long-neglected challenges.
