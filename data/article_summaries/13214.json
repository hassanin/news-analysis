The White House has announced plans to hold a Forum on Workplace Flexibility on March 31st. President Obama and the First Lady will speak about the importance of creating work practices that allow workers to meet their job demands without sacrificing their family needs. The forum will bring together union leaders, executives, small business owners, and policy experts to exchange ideas and strategies to make the workplace more flexible for American workers and families. The goal is to find ways to balance job demands with family responsibilities, as many workers struggle to maintain this balance and sometimes even lose their jobs due to caregiving responsibilities. The President and First Lady are eager to hear ideas from working parents, business leaders, support groups, and experts to create and promote flexible workplaces. More information about press coverage and additional details about the Forum will be announced soon.
