Vice President Kamala Harris addressed a gathering at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where she spoke about the Atlanta shootings that took place a year ago. She emphasized the need to stand united against violence and intimidation. Harris highlighted the increase in violence and discrimination against the Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) community and the steps taken by the administration to protect them, including the signing of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. She also mentioned the numerous bomb threats made against historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other faith-based and academic institutions, leading to fear and anxiety. The administration announced that HBCUs facing significant disruptions due to threats are eligible for grant funding to enhance campus security, hire mental health professionals, and provide specialized training to security staff. Additionally, a resource guide for colleges and universities on detecting, preventing, and recovering from threats and acts of violence will be released. Harris concluded by reaffirming the administration's commitment to protecting all communities from violence and hate.
