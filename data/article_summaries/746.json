The White House has released new state-by-state fact sheets that showcase various economic indicators to illustrate the positive economic progress made under President Biden's leadership. These indicators include state employment, unemployment insurance claims, gross domestic product, supplemental poverty, and vaccination rates. The fact sheets emphasize the success of President Biden's plan to rebuild the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. The American Rescue Plan has played a significant role in this progress, leading to near-historic lows in unemployment, widespread vaccination, a high number of adults with positive financial outlooks, a significant reduction in reliance on government unemployment benefits, and record rates of new business creation. The fact sheets provide a strong foundation for a stable and sustainable growth trajectory that benefits working families. Links to the fact sheets for all 50 states are provided.
