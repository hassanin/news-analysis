The White House and the U.S. Department of Education have announced that 20 new communities have joined the My Brother's Keeper (MBK) Success Mentors Initiative, bringing the total to 30 communities. The initiative aims to reduce chronic student absences by connecting over one million students with trained mentors over the next 3-5 years. The program uses existing resources linked to schools and the early warning metric of chronic absenteeism to drive student success. The original ten cities that launched the initiative earlier this year have already supported over 8,000 chronically absent students with success mentors. The initiative is supported by a public-private network that includes organizations such as the Ad Council, City Year, and United Way. Additionally, Kevin Durant, Pierre Gar√ßon, STATE Bags, and Roc Nation have announced their support for the initiative. STATE Bags will donate 30,000 backpacks to students participating in the MBK Success Mentors initiative.
