The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new initiatives aimed at lowering food, rental housing, and other costs, as well as updated guidance regarding the enforcement of antitrust laws in the modern economy. These initiatives are part of the administration's efforts to promote competition, support small businesses, and reduce the concentration of power in various industries.

Upon taking office, President Biden recognized the need to address the lack of competition in the economy, which had led to higher prices and lower wages for Americans. To tackle this issue, he established the White House Competition Council, which aims to take a comprehensive approach to promoting competition.

During its fifth meeting, the White House Competition Council announced three new actions to promote competition and lower costs. These actions build upon the numerous initiatives that agencies have already taken since the Executive Order was signed. Agencies have not only fulfilled a majority of the Order's 72 initiatives but have also launched additional new initiatives, demonstrating a commitment to a holistic approach.

The administration's actions thus far have covered various sectors, including transportation, food and agriculture, technology and internet services, labor markets, health care, small businesses, and banking, insurance, and consumer finance.

Overall, the Biden-Harris Administration is actively working to address the concentration of power in industries, promote competition, and lower costs for American households.
