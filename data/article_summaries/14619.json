The President, Vice President, and senior staff members of the White House recently held a meeting with Senate Democrats to discuss progress on commonsense immigration reform. The President emphasized key principles for bipartisan efforts, including strengthening border security, creating a path to citizenship, holding employers accountable, and streamlining legal immigration. The President acknowledged the progress made in securing the border and emphasized the need to continue building on this progress. He also stated that strengthening borders and providing an earned path to citizenship should not be seen as mutually exclusive goals. The Senators involved were thanked for their work, but the President made it clear that he expects the process to continue moving forward and is prepared to introduce his own legislation if Congress fails to act.
