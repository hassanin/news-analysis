In this statement, the President acknowledges the serious fiscal situation in the country, attributing it to both the economic downturn inherited and years of failing to pay for new policies. The President emphasizes that the deficits threatening job creation and economic growth did not happen overnight and won't be solved overnight. The President believes that both how policies are paid for and how Washington works need to be changed. The President expresses strong support for legislation to create a bipartisan fiscal commission to find solutions for the nation's fiscal challenges. The President calls on Senators from both parties to vote for the creation of this commission. The President believes that by making tough choices together, committing to paying for spending, and responsibly stewarding the economy, the foundation for sustainable job creation and economic growth can be laid while restoring fiscal sustainability to the nation.
