President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Arkansas due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from April 26 to May 19, 2017. This declaration allows for Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available for affected individuals in 13 counties, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. State and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, can also receive Federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for Federal funding. Jerry S. Thomas has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone starting tomorrow.
