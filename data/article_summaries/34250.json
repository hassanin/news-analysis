On October 31, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring that the national emergency with respect to Sudan, which was initially declared on November 3, 1997, will continue. The national emergency was declared due to the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan, which were deemed to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Despite some positive developments, the crisis has not been resolved, and the actions and policies of the Sudanese government continue to pose a threat. The President determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
