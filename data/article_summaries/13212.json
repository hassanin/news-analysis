President Obama has vetoed H.J. Res. 88, a resolution that would nullify the Department of Labor's final conflict of interest rule. The rule is designed to protect Americans' savings and retirement security by ensuring that financial advisers act in their clients' best interests when giving retirement investment advice. The previous regulations did not adequately protect consumers, leading to higher fees and lower returns for retirees. The Department of Labor's final rule reflects input from industry, advocates, and Members of Congress, and has been streamlined to reduce compliance burdens. President Obama believes it is essential that these critical protections go into effect, and he cannot support the resolution to block them. Therefore, he has vetoed the resolution.
