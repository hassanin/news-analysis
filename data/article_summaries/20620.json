The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a press call to discuss recent developments with Iran. The call was on background, meaning it could be attributed to senior administration officials. The officials discussed the progress made in the past two days, including the implementation of the nuclear deal, the release of American prisoners, a settlement on military equipment sold to Iran, and the imposition of new designations related to Iran's ballistic missile program. The officials emphasized the importance of diplomacy and engagement with Iran, while also acknowledging that differences and enforcement measures will continue. They also mentioned the possibility of further cooperation with Iran on issues such as Syria and ISIS, but stated that it would depend on Iran's willingness to engage constructively. The officials addressed concerns about the prisoner swap setting a bad precedent, stating that it was a humanitarian decision and not related to intelligence assets. They also explained the reasons behind the settlement on military equipment and the timing of the prisoner releases. The officials expressed the hope that Iran would choose to moderate its behavior and engage constructively with the international community, but also stated that the US would continue to enforce sanctions and have strong differences with Iran if necessary.
