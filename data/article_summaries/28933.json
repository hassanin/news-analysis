President Trump has successfully promoted U.S. agriculture and food trade globally by breaking down barriers to U.S. agricultural exports. The Administration has finalized technical requirements to allow the export of U.S. pork to Argentina for the first time since 1992. This is part of a larger effort to increase market access for U.S. agriculture around the world, including reducing inspection requirements for U.S. citrus exports to the European Union, and opening up markets in Brazil, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea. President Trump believes that American food producers have been treated unfairly on the international stage and is committed to leveling the playing field for America's farmers. He will work to increase access to international markets and confront countries that do not treat the U.S. fairly in trade.
