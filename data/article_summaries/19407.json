The White House has announced that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will lead the U.S. delegation and deliver the U.S. national statement at the Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The conference, which is held every other year, aims to encourage states to sign and ratify the treaty. The United States had attended the initial conference in 1999 but had not attended the subsequent four conferences. The Obama Administration's participation in this year's conference demonstrates its strong commitment to the CTBT and its goal of working with other nations to secure the treaty's entry into force. Under Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher will also hold bilateral sessions during the conference to advance this agenda. The President's commitment to the CTBT is part of his broader agenda to prevent nuclear proliferation and work towards a world without nuclear weapons.
