In this article, President Obama emphasizes the importance of extending the payroll tax cut for middle-class families. He explains that if Congress fails to renew the tax cut before the end of the year, families could face a tax hike of about $1,000 annually. He argues that extending the tax cut is crucial for the economy as a whole, as well as for individual families. The President also mentions his proposal to expand the tax cut in his jobs bill, which would provide a typical working family with a tax cut of $1,500 next year. He criticizes Senate Republicans for voting against this tax cut and questions their priorities in protecting high-end tax breaks for the wealthy while neglecting the needs of working Americans. President Obama also addresses the issue of paying for the tax cuts, pointing out that Republicans have not always felt the need to pay for tax cuts in the past. He expresses his willingness to work with Republicans to extend the tax cut in a responsible way, but refuses to make additional deep cuts in areas such as education or the safety net to pay for it. The President also emphasizes the importance of extending unemployment insurance, as millions of Americans are still looking for work. He argues that leaving 1.3 million Americans without unemployment insurance in January would be a terrible mistake that would harm the economy. President Obama concludes by urging Congress to keep their word to the American people and not raise taxes on them, emphasizing that now is the time to keep growing the economy and creating jobs.
