President Donald J. Trump recently hosted a CEO Town Hall on Unleashing American Business at the White House to discuss ways to strengthen the economy. One of the main issues discussed was the current Federal permitting process, which can take a decade or more for the government to understand the potential environmental impact of a project. President Trump presented a flow chart that illustrates the complexity of this process, involving 10 different governmental entities making 15 decisions governed by 29 laws and 5 executive orders. This does not even include permits required under State or local law. While it is important to protect the environment, spending millions on documents that provide no tangible environmental benefit is seen as highly inefficient. Other countries such as Britain, Australia, and Canada have much faster permitting processes, showing that a 10-year process is not necessary to protect the environment. President Trump is committed to reorganizing and accelerating this permitting process and has sought input from various Federal agencies, Governors, Mayors, Congress, and industry leaders to find ways to drastically reduce the time it takes.
