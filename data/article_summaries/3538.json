The House has passed a bill showing bipartisan support for Ukraine, Russia, and the world that the United States stands with Ukraine in defending their democracy against Russian aggression. The bill includes provisions for security, economic, humanitarian, and food assistance to Ukraine and the region. It also allows for the sending of weapons such as artillery, armored vehicles, and ammunition to Ukraine, as well as replenishing stockpiles and supporting U.S. troops on NATO territory. The President has emphasized the urgency of this effort, and the hope is to get the bill to his desk quickly.
