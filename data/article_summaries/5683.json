Under President Biden's leadership, the United States has hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and demonstrated its ability to drive sustainable and inclusive growth in the region. American businesses are the largest source of foreign direct investment in APEC economies, contributing to prosperity and innovation. The public and private sectors are delivering sustainable investments that create jobs within APEC member economies and the United States. Additionally, the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI), an initiative led by President Biden and the G7, aims to leverage private sector expertise and financing to promote quality investments in low- and middle-income countries. At the APEC CEO Summit, U.S. companies announced over $50 billion of investments into APEC economies in 2023. These investments align with the three policy pillars of the APEC Economic Leaders' Week, which focus on creating a more inclusive and interconnected region, supporting green and sustainable practices, and enhancing resilience and security. Specific examples of these investments include promoting digital integration, supporting clean energy transition, and strengthening supply chains and cyber preparedness.
