President Obama met with the State Department's Special Envoy for Guantanamo Closure, Clifford Sloan, and the Defense Department's Special Envoy for Guantanamo Closure, Paul Lewis. The President expressed his gratitude for their work and reaffirmed his commitment to closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. He emphasized that the Special Envoys have his full support in facilitating the transfer of detainees. The President highlighted the financial burden and negative impact on the country's reputation that the Guantanamo facility poses. He mentioned that almost one million dollars per detainee per year are spent on housing detainees at Guantanamo, amounting to nearly $200 million annually. The Administration will continue to transfer detainees who have been cleared to go to other countries, but Congress needs to lift restrictions on detainee transfers in order to responsibly reduce the detainee population and ultimately close the facility.
