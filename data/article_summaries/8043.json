The press call discussed the new Comprehensive Framework for Responsible Development of Digital Assets. The call highlighted the importance of responsible development of digital assets for American interests, including consumer well-being, financial stability, and technological leadership. The call marked the release of several reports that were part of an executive order issued by President Biden last March. The reports provide analysis and recommendations on various aspects of digital assets, including central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), consumer protection, and mitigating risks. Key findings include the need for continued research and experimentation on CBDCs, strategies for mitigating digital asset harms, and the development of a digital asset research and development agenda. The reports also emphasize the importance of international engagement and leadership in the digital asset space. The administration will continue to prioritize this work across the executive branch and collaborate with Congress on potential legislation.
