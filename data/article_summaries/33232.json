President Trump spoke at the Utah State Capitol to announce his decision to shrink the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. He criticized previous administrations for abusing the Antiquities Act and taking control of large areas of land. Trump's decision is aimed at giving control of the land back to local communities and restoring their access and enjoyment of the land. He emphasized the importance of protecting national treasures and allowing public use of public lands. Trump signed two presidential proclamations to modify the national monument designations.
