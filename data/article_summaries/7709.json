The President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has declared a national emergency in response to the threat posed by significant narcotics traffickers based in Colombia. This emergency was initially declared in 1995 and has been extended for another year, beyond October 21, 2022. The actions of these traffickers are deemed to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, as well as causing extreme levels of violence, corruption, and harm both domestically and abroad. This declaration allows the United States to take necessary measures to address this ongoing threat.
