The article discusses the $5 billion Recovery Act investment in scientific research and jobs by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The investment aims to support tens of thousands of jobs and stimulate the economy by producing goods and services beyond the lab and classroom. The grants will fund research in various areas, including cancer, heart disease, and autism. For cancer research, the funding will contribute to mapping the genomic changes that occur in major types and subtypes of cancer. This will lead to advancements in predicting tumor spread, developing new anti-cancer agents, and identifying genetic changes associated with oral cancers. In terms of heart disease, the investment will support the sequencing of genomes to identify genetic changes that cause risk factors and develop personalized treatments. For autism research, the funding will be used to analyze bio-specimens for environmental risk factors and identify specific subtypes based on genomics. The article provides examples of how the Recovery Act funds will bring about advancements in medical research and treatment.
