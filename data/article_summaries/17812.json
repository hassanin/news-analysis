The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a press call to discuss President Obama's executive order on "Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities." The executive order is aimed at combating cyber threats and filling in the gaps where diplomatic and law enforcement tools cannot reach. It allows the Secretary of the Treasury to impose sanctions on individuals or entities engaged in significant malicious cyber activities that pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health of the United States. The sanctions freeze assets and prevent transactions with those targeted under the executive order. The executive order is not meant to target free speech or interfere with the free and open internet, and it will be used judiciously and in extraordinary circumstances. The level of evidence required for sanctions is reasonable cause to believe. The executive order is not targeted at any specific country or region and can be used to target any malicious cyber activity regardless of location. The executive order complements existing authorities and can be used to target activity directly rather than officials or persons related to a specific government. Due process is involved, and those sanctioned have the ability to challenge their designation with the Office of Foreign Assets Control or file a suit in a federal district court. The executive order is not retroactive, and there is no specific timeline for designating individuals or groups. The executive order could potentially be applied to open cases where suspects reside in countries where extradition is difficult. The level of public disclosure of evidence will depend on the classification of the information. The enactment of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) could assist in identifying parties that could be targeted with sanctions by increasing the information flow between the government and the private sector.
