Today's jobs report highlights the need for more good-paying jobs, especially for women. While the economy has created 1.5 million jobs in the past three months, there is still a deficit of eight million jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, there are two million fewer women in the workforce. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken steps to address this issue, including provisions in the American Rescue Plan to support women workers through childcare assistance, small business support, and direct payments. The impact of these measures, coupled with the vaccination effort, is starting to be seen as more Americans return to work. However, there is still more work to be done, with approximately five million women unable to work due to childcare issues. The American Families Plan aims to lower the cost of childcare, enabling more women to enter the workforce, while the American Jobs Plan seeks to create millions of good-paying jobs. Empowering women not only benefits families and communities but also strengthens the economy.
