President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Mississippi due to severe storms, winds, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from February 22 to March 29, 2019. This declaration allows for Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available to State and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Calhoun, Chickasaw, Clay, Grenada, Lowndes, Pontotoc, and Tishomingo are eligible for this assistance. Additionally, hazard mitigation measures statewide will receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Lai Sun Yee has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are still ongoing in other areas, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are completed.
