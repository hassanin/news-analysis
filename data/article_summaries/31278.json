President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Alabama and ordered Federal aid to assist with recovery efforts after severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes struck on March 3, 2019. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in Lee County, which can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures statewide on a cost-sharing basis. Gerard M. Stolar has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated county can apply for assistance starting tomorrow through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling the FEMA toll-free numbers.
