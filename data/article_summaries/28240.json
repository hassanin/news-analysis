President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency to address the threat of foreign interference in United States elections. The order authorizes the US government to impose sanctions on foreign individuals and entities involved in election interference. The President has directed the Director of National Intelligence to regularly assess any information related to foreign election interference. The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security have also been instructed to evaluate the effects of such interference on election infrastructure and provide recommendations for response. If foreign election interference is confirmed, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, can impose sanctions on those responsible. The Executive Order also calls for the development of additional recommended sanctions measures targeting companies in significant economic sectors of countries that engage in or sponsor election interference.
