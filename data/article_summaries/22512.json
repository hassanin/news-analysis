President Barack Obama has proclaimed November 2014 as Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of protecting and strengthening the country's critical infrastructure, such as power plants, hospitals, and highways, which support the nation's security and economic growth. The increased interdependence of these vital resources and networks has created both opportunities for growth and innovation, as well as greater risks and vulnerabilities. The government is working to protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats, physical risks, and other challenges. Private sector involvement and public-private partnerships are encouraged to address these issues. The proclamation also highlights the need to invest in 21st-century infrastructure to increase resilience, create jobs, and expand opportunities for Americans. The month is dedicated to recognizing the importance of safeguarding and strengthening critical infrastructure and supporting first-class infrastructure that sustains America's leadership role on the world stage.
