The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a statement about the efforts to counter nuclear smuggling. The statement highlights the actions taken by various countries to prevent the illicit trafficking of nuclear or radioactive materials. These actions include building national capacities, such as law enforcement and intelligence efforts, radiation detection systems, nuclear forensics, and legal training for prosecutors. Several countries have also passed new laws and regulations to combat illicit trafficking, with a commitment to pass more by the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit. The importance of international cooperation and sharing information on nuclear smuggling cases is emphasized, with INTERPOL being recognized as an effective mechanism for identifying smuggling networks. The United States has donated resources to INTERPOL and other countries for counter nuclear smuggling efforts. There is a pledge to share resources and lessons learned by the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit.
