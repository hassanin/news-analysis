President Obama issued a statement on National HIV Testing Day, emphasizing the importance of early detection and treatment for HIV. He highlighted that over half of adults in the United States have never been tested for HIV, and nearly one in five people living with HIV are unaware of their status. The President urged Americans to get tested, stating that it is now easier and faster than ever. He also mentioned that the Affordable Care Act requires new health care plans to cover HIV testing without any additional costs. President Obama emphasized that HIV testing opens the door to treatment, reduces the spread of the virus, and helps people lead longer, healthier lives. He shared that he and Michelle Obama were tested for HIV during a trip to Africa in 2006, and encouraged others to do the same without shame or stigma. The President concluded by stating that if everyone does their part by getting tested and encouraging others to do so, we can move closer to an AIDS-free generation.
