President Donald Trump has signed the "Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act" into law. While he supports measures to punish Iran, North Korea, and Russia, he believes the legislation contains unconstitutional provisions. Trump points out that certain sections infringe on the president's exclusive authority to recognize foreign governments and undertake diplomatic initiatives. He also highlights provisions that would require him to deny entry to certain individuals without exception. Trump expects his administration to implement the bill in a manner consistent with his constitutional authority, but he urges Congress not to hinder efforts to resolve the conflict in Ukraine or negatively impact American businesses and allies.
