President vetoed S.J. Res. 68, a resolution that aimed to terminate the use of US Armed Forces in hostilities against Iran. The President deemed the resolution insulting and accused Democrats of using it to divide the Republican Party for the upcoming election. He also argued that the resolution was based on misunderstandings of facts and law, stating that the US is not engaged in the use of force against Iran. The President defended his previous action of eliminating Qassem Soleimani and claimed that it was fully authorized by law and the Constitution. He further argued that the resolution would have limited his ability to protect the US, its allies, and partners, and that the President's constitutional authority to use military force is not limited to defense against imminent attack. The President concluded by stating that Congress should not have passed the resolution.
