On September 16, 2011, the President signed into law H.R. 2887, the "Surface and Air Transportation Programs Extension Act of 2011." This law extends funding for programs funded from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) and the authority to make expenditures from the HTF for HTF-financed programs. It also extends the authority to collect taxes that fund the HTF. Additionally, the law extends the authorities to collect taxes that fund the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, make expenditures from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, and make grants to airports under the Airport Improvement Program. These extensions are effective until March 31, 2012, for the Highway Trust Fund, and until January 31, 2012, for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund.
