The article is a presidential memorandum from December 11, 2009, titled "Eleventh Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation." In the memorandum, President Barack Obama directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct a review of the compensation system for uniformed service members of the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, and the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Public Health Service. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the current military compensation system is sufficient and responsive in recruiting and retaining high-caliber personnel. The review is instructed to focus on areas such as compensation for service in combat zones, the Reserve and National Guard's compensation and benefits, benefits for wounded warriors and their caregivers, and pay incentives for critical career fields. The Secretary of Defense is also directed to involve representatives from other relevant executive branch agencies in the review process. The review is expected to be completed within one year, with updates provided to the President at six months and 30 days prior to the end of the review period. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of taking care of personnel in uniform and their families.
