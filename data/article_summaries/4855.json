Vice President Kamala Harris has relaunched the annual cabinet-level U.S.-Mexico High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) to advance economic and social priorities between the United States and Mexico. The HLED aims to foster regional prosperity, job creation, investment, and reduce inequality and poverty. The U.S. delegation included Vice President Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, and U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar. The Mexican delegation included Secretary of External Relations Marcelo Ebrard, Secretary of Economy Tatiana Clouthier, Mexican Ambassador to the United States Esteban Moctezuma, and Undersecretary of Finance and Public Credit Gabriel Yorio. The HLED will focus on building a seamless marketplace, promoting sustainable economic development, securing digital space, and investing in an inclusive workforce. The United States and Mexico committed to meeting annually at the cabinet level and semi-annually at the sub-cabinet level to strengthen their strategic partnership.
