The White House announced that President Obama will be traveling to Cincinnati, Ohio to deliver remarks at the Brent-Spence Bridge. The purpose of the trip is to urge Congress to pass the American Jobs Act, which would make much-needed investments in infrastructure projects across the country and create jobs. The Brent-Spence Bridge is on one of the busiest trucking routes in North America, but is considered "functionally obsolete" and in need of significant repairs. The President's trip aims to highlight the urgent need for infrastructure improvements and the importance of passing the American Jobs Act.
