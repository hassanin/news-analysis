The United States has taken various actions to reassure its NATO allies of its commitment to their security and territorial integrity in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. These actions include increasing exercises, training, and rotational presence in Central and Eastern Europe, deploying U.S. planners to assist allies in designing and hosting training and exercise opportunities, increasing the responsiveness of U.S. forces to reinforce NATO, increasing participation in NATO naval force deployments, and building the capacity of partner countries like Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. The President has called on Congress to support a European Reassurance Initiative of up to $1 billion to fund these measures. In addition to this initiative, the U.S. has already undertaken various specific efforts, such as land force deployments, maritime deployments, and air deployments. The U.S. is also reviewing its force presence in Europe in light of the new security challenges on the continent.
