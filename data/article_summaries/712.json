President Biden has signed an Executive Order (E.O.) in response to President Putin's recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics as independent states. The E.O. prohibits financial transactions involving these regions and authorizes sanctions on individuals involved in undermining Ukraine's sovereignty. The Department of the Treasury is issuing six General Licenses to ensure humanitarian and related activities can continue. The United States is prepared to take swift and severe economic measures with allies in the event of a further Russian invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. is consulting closely with Ukraine and allies on next steps and urging Russia to deescalate the situation. The E.O. provides flexibility to impose similar restrictions on any other regions of Ukraine if necessary.
