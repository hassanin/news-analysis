President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Georgia and ordered federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts following Tropical Storm Zeta on October 29, 2020. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in various counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Leda Khoury has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
