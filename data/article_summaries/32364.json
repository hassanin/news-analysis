The article discusses a report from the U.S. Border Patrol, stating that there is an immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexican border. Border Patrol agents apprehended over 66,000 migrants in February, the highest number in almost a decade. The article attributes this increase to loopholes in U.S. immigration law and a weak asylum process. It mentions the unintended consequences of the Trafficking Victim Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which requires the Border Patrol to treat unaccompanied alien children differently, and a 2016 court case that requires the release of all children from custody. The article concludes that many migrants are taking advantage of these loopholes and disappearing into the U.S.
