The United States House of Representatives has passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a bipartisan infrastructure bill aimed at creating jobs and addressing the climate crisis. The bill includes significant investments in transportation systems, such as rail, roads, bridges, ports, airports, and public transit. It also focuses on replacing lead water pipes, expanding access to high-speed internet, and building a national network of electric vehicle charging stations. Additionally, the bill includes investments in environmental clean-up and resilience against natural disasters.
