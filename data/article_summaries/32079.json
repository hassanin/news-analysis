The President has issued a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans will continue beyond June 26, 2020. This emergency was declared in 2001 and is related to extremist violence in the former Republic of Macedonia and obstruction of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia and UN Security Council Resolution 1244 in Kosovo. The President believes that these actions pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and therefore, it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
