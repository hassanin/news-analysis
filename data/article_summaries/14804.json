In this press gaggle, Press Secretary Jay Carney provides updates on President Obama's phone call with Wilma Parsons, the daughter of Ann Harris, the owner of Ann's Restaurant, who passed away. Carney states that the President expressed his condolences and that the whole family is in his thoughts and prayers. The Ohio campaign also released a statement expressing their sadness and condolences to Ann's family. When asked if there were concerns about food poisoning, Carney clarifies that Ann wasn't even in the restaurant when the President visited and that there was no concern about the President's security. Carney also addresses questions about Greg Schultz, the state director in Ohio, who reportedly resigned as the county Democratic chairman amid investigations into the party's finances. Carney says that the President still has confidence in Schultz and defers further questions to the Ohio campaign. Additionally, Carney and Psaki discuss the President's message on the campaign trail, emphasizing the competing visions for the future of the country and the President's focus on healthcare, education, and job creation. They also acknowledge that the economy still has a long way to go and that the President would sign the remaining elements of the American Jobs Act, which could put up to a million Americans back to work. However, Republicans in Congress have opposed passing this legislation. Finally, they criticize Mitt Romney's plans and rhetoric, stating that they do not offer solutions for short-term growth and job creation.
