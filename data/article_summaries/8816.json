President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Tennessee due to severe storms, winds, and tornadoes that occurred in December 2021. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Funding will be available for individuals in several counties to help with temporary housing, home repairs, and uninsured property losses. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Myra M. Shird as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated as damage assessments continue. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by calling FEMA. The FEMA News Desk can be contacted for further information.
