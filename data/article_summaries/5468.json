The Supreme Court has rejected Alabama's attempt to weaken the Voting Rights Act and dilute the voting power of Black Americans. While this decision upholds the law, efforts to protect and expand the freedom to vote are ongoing. Voting is considered the most fundamental right of American citizenship, as it unlocks other rights and ensures fair representation. To further this cause, the President and Vice President are calling on Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.
