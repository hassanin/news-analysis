President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 3 through May 9, 2015, as National Charter Schools Week. In the proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of providing all children with a high-quality education and recognizes the role that public charter schools play in achieving this goal. Charter schools, as independent public schools, have the flexibility to try new models of learning and methods that encourage academic excellence. However, they are also held to high standards and accountability. When a charter school is underperforming and not improving, the tough decision to shut it down must be made. On the other hand, successful charter schools can help spur systemic reform and their approaches can be replicated in classrooms across America. The President is dedicated to providing every child access to a complete and competitive education, and he believes that harnessing the power of American ingenuity is vital to achieving this commitment. The President's Administration has challenged states to raise education standards, improve teacher effectiveness, and adopt new strategies to help struggling schools. This comprehensive approach to education reform has shown that innovation yields results that benefit all students and that progress is possible. The President will continue to build on this success and work to ensure that all children receive an education worthy of their potential. National Charter Schools Week aims to honor the parents, educators, and civic leaders who make the vision of charter schools a reality. The proclamation calls on states and communities to support high-quality public schools, including charter schools, and the students they serve.
