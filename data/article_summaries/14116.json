Mexico, the United States, and Canada have reached an agreement at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C. to collaborate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in converting Mexico's research reactor fuel. This collaboration aims to reduce the risks associated with illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and support Mexico's nuclear energy development. The conversion from highly enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU) will enhance nuclear security in North America. The leaders of the three countries expressed their commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and praised Mexico's leadership in this area. This effort is a specific outcome of the Nuclear Security Summit and will be carried out under the auspices of the IAEA.
