President Biden convened the U.S.-led Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate to urge leaders of major economies to take faster climate action. The leaders discussed the collective urgency of addressing the global climate crisis and President Biden announced a Global Methane Pledge to reduce methane pollution. A ministerial session with China, Germany, India, and Russia was also scheduled. This meeting builds on the April Leaders Summit on Climate and a summary of the forum will be released later.
