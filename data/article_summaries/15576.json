President Obama is urging the Senate to ratify the Marrakesh Treaty, which aims to improve access to published works for individuals who are blind, visually impaired, or print disabled. The treaty, negotiated under the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), aligns with existing U.S. copyright standards and requires some minor changes to U.S. law for implementation. The President recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the treaty and provide its advice and consent for ratification.
