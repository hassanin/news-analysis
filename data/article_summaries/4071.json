President Biden will establish the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention to address the issue of gun violence in the United States. Vice President Harris will oversee the office, while Stefanie Feldman, a policy advisor to President Biden on gun violence prevention, will serve as the director. Greg Jackson and Rob Wilcox, both gun violence prevention advocates, will join the administration as deputy directors. The office aims to implement executive and legislative actions, including the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act signed by President Biden, to combat gun violence. The administration will continue to push for universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The office will work towards reducing violence and engaging with Congressional leaders, state and local leaders, and advocates to make progress in saving lives.
