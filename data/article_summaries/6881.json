President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued a proclamation revoking several Executive Orders and Presidential Proclamations that imposed restrictions on individuals entering the United States from primarily Muslim and African countries. The President states that these actions go against the values of religious freedom and tolerance that the United States was founded upon, and have also undermined national security and damaged international alliances. The revocation of these orders and proclamations is intended to enhance national security and uphold American values. The proclamation also directs the resumption of visa processing and provides guidelines for clearing the backlog of cases. Additionally, it calls for a review of information-sharing relationships and the strengthening of partnerships. The proclamation concludes with general provisions and clarifies that it does not create any new rights or benefits.
