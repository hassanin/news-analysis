Sustainable buildings have also seen progress, with an increase of 11 million square feet in the federal portfolio. Examples include the Department of the Interior's Genoa National Fish Hatchery and Great River Road Interpretive Center, which has achieved energy performance 62 percent better than an average building. Federal agencies have also made significant strides in reducing energy use, with the lowest total energy use on record. Examples include the Department of Commerce and NASA's Glenn Research Center, which have implemented innovative energy efficiency projects resulting in substantial energy and water savings. Overall, federal agencies are achieving and exceeding sustainability goals, conserving resources, saving taxpayer dollars, and improving agency resilience.
