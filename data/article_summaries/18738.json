The Senate has passed H.R. 205, the Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Homeownership Act (HEARTH Act), which allows long-term leasing of restricted Indian lands for residential, business, and other purposes without prior approval from the Secretary of the Interior. The Act promotes tribal self-determination and aims to create jobs in Indian Country. It grants federally recognized tribes the ability to develop and implement their own regulations for leasing on Indian lands, reducing the time it takes to approve leases for homes and small businesses. The President supports this legislation and plans to sign it into law.
