Today, representatives from state and local government gathered for a Forum on Mental Health and Well Being, organized by Julie Chavez Rodriguez and Christen Linke Young from the White House. The forum focused on tackling the mental health crisis, which is a key part of President Biden's Unity Agenda. The administration has been working on strengthening system capacity, connecting more Americans to care, and creating healthy and supportive environments. They have expanded access to mental health services through investments in the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and have proposed further support in the FY 2024 budget request. During the forum, Secretary Xavier Becerra discussed initiatives such as the launch of 988, the National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, and FindSupport.gov. The expansion of mental health services for youth in schools and communities was also highlighted. The forum also discussed leveraging Medicaid waivers for comprehensive mental health service provision and investing in the behavioral health workforce. The White House staff expressed gratitude to state and local leaders and organizations for their leadership and affirmed the administration's support and partnership in addressing the mental health crisis.
