In a blog post, St. Louis Mayor expresses support for President Obama's compromise with Congressional leaders on the Middle Class Tax Cut Framework. The mayor believes that while not everyone got everything they wanted, the agreement includes positive measures such as reforming the alternative minimum tax, extending tax cuts, reducing payroll tax, and extending unemployment benefits. The mayor believes that these measures will stimulate the economy and support those most affected by the current business climate. The mayor applauds President Obama for making the deal.
