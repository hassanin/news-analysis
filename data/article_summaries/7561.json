The Quad partners, consisting of the United States, Japan, Australia, and India, have announced several initiatives to address global challenges. Firstly, they will launch a partnership to accelerate the end of the COVID-19 pandemic by expanding vaccine manufacturing and assisting countries in the Indo-Pacific with vaccination efforts. This will be done in coordination with organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and COVAX.

Secondly, the Quad partners have identified climate change as a priority and will establish a Climate Working Group to address this issue in the Indo-Pacific region.

Lastly, they will create a Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group to ensure that technology in the Indo-Pacific region is governed and operated according to shared interests and values. This group will focus on promoting a free, open, inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific.
