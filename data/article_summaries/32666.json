On May 9, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to enhance employment support for military spouses. The order aims to assist agencies in hiring military spouses by promoting the military spouse hiring authority. The policy recognizes the contributions of military spouses to the personal and financial success of military families but acknowledges the challenges they face in maintaining employment due to frequent relocations and other factors. The order directs agencies to actively advertise and promote the military spouse hiring authority, consider candidates under this authority when filling vacant positions, and provide information and guidance on its effective use. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is tasked with administering the order and providing annual reports on its implementation and recommendations for improvement. The order also includes provisions to improve license portability and remove barriers to the employment of military spouses.
