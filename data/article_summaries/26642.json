The article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued on October 28, 2020, regarding immigration and refugee admissions for Fiscal Year 2021. The memorandum authorizes the admission of up to 15,000 refugees to the United States, taking into account unused places from the previous year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The allocation of refugee admissions is specified for different categories, including refugees of special humanitarian concern, refugees from Iraq, and refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras. The memorandum also allows for the transfer of unused admissions between allocations if needed. Certain high-risk areas of terrorist presence or control, such as Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, are excluded from refugee admissions, except for refugees of special humanitarian concern or those with a well-founded fear of persecution on account of religion. The memorandum also designates certain groups of people within their countries of nationality or habitual residence as eligible for refugee status. It emphasizes the importance of placing newly admitted refugees in states and localities that are willing to receive them and support their integration into American society. The memorandum concludes by stating that providing assistance to persons applying for admission as part of the overseas refugee admissions program will contribute to the foreign policy interests of the United States.
