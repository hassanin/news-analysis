President Obama has proposed new funding to help young Americans connect with jobs and skills training to start their careers. The President's FY 2017 Budget includes nearly $6 billion in new funding to help over 1 million young people gain work experience, skills, and networks. The plan includes a $5.5 billion proposal to connect young people to first jobs over the summer and year-round, as well as a $2 billion competitive grant program to re-connect disconnected youth to educational and workforce pathways. The President is also calling on businesses to provide internships, training, mentoring, and job interviews to young people who are not in school or working. Additionally, the President is proposing investments to give more Americans skills for in-demand jobs, such as creating an American Talent Compact, a Workforce Data Science and Innovation Fund, and an Apprenticeship Training Fund. The President's budget proposals aim to help young Americans start their careers and address the challenges they face in getting their first job.
