The article is a notice from the White House announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Lebanon. The national emergency was initially declared in 2007 due to the actions of certain individuals undermining Lebanon's government and democratic institutions. These actions included politically motivated violence and intimidation, Syrian interference, and infringement upon Lebanese sovereignty. Ongoing activities, such as arms transfers to Hizballah, continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency will remain in effect for another year.
