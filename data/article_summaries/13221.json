President Barack Obama has notified Congress that he intends to continue the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq. This national emergency was initially declared in 2003 and has been extended beyond its anniversary date of May 22, 2013. The President believes that obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the maintenance of peace and security, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in the country still pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to continue this national emergency.
