Second Lady Karen Pence delivered remarks at the 2019 Military Spouse Employment Partnership (MSEP) New Partner Induction Ceremony. MSEP is a network of non-profit, business, and government agencies that have committed to train and hire military spouses, who currently face a 24% unemployment rate. The ceremony inducted 42 new partners. Pence commended the commitment of the partners to recruit, hire, promote, and retain military spouses, emphasizing their vital contributions to the armed forces and military communities. Pence launched an awareness campaign in 2018 to promote and encourage military spouses, and has been traveling to address employment challenges and collaboration on opportunities for military spouses. MSEP is part of the Department of Defense's Spouse Education and Career Opportunities (SECO) initiative, launched in 2011 to strengthen educational and career opportunities for military spouses.
