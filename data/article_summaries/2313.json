President Biden will call for a Junk Fee Prevention Act to eliminate unfair and costly junk fees as part of the fourth meeting of the President's Competition Council. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is proposing a rule to slash excessive credit card late fees, which is projected to save consumers as much as $9 billion a year. The Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is releasing a report assessing barriers to competition in the mobile app store ecosystem and providing recommendations to level the playing field for app developers and give consumers more control over their devices.

The President is urging Congress to pass a Junk Fee Prevention Act that cracks down on four types of junk fees. The first is excessive online concert, sporting event, and entertainment ticket fees, which often reach more than 20% of the ticket's face value. The President is calling on Congress to prohibit excessive fees, require fee disclosure in the ticket price, and mandate disclosure of any ticket holdbacks. 

The second is airline fees for family members to sit with young children. The President believes no parent should have to pay extra to sit next to their child and is calling on Congress to ban this practice.

The third is exorbitant early termination fees for TV, phone, and internet service. The President urges Congress to eliminate these fees, which can exceed $200, to promote competition and customer choice.

The fourth is surprise resort and destination fees. The President is calling on Congress to ban these fees by requiring hotels to include them in the price of the room, so consumers aren't surprised.

Passing the Junk Fee Prevention Act will save Americans billions of dollars a year and create a more competitive market by eliminating hidden fees. The Biden-Harris Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these fees and other junk fees that harm consumers.
