The funding will be provided on a cost-sharing basis to state, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding. Dolph A. Diemont has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area.
