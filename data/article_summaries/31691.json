On May 17, 2017, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding the determination of petroleum supply and reduction of purchases from Iran. The memorandum stated that there is enough petroleum and petroleum products available from countries other than Iran, allowing for a significant reduction in the volume of purchases from Iran. However, the United States is not currently seeking to reduce Iran's sales of crude oil. The Secretary of State has been authorized to publish this determination in the Federal Register, and the situation will continue to be monitored closely.
