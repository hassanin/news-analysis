The article is a message from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, addressed to the Speaker of the House and the President. It discusses the continuation of the national emergency with respect to North Korea. The National Emergencies Act states that a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and transmits it to Congress, stating that the emergency is to continue. The President has sent such a notice, indicating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 in 2008, expanded in scope in 2010, and addressed further in 2011, is to continue beyond June 26, 2013. The message emphasizes the existence and risk of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, as well as the actions and policies of the North Korean government that destabilize the region and threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain the measures taken to address these threats.
