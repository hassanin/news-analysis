The Presidents of France and the United States, the Chancellor of Germany, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom met in Rome to discuss Iran's escalating nuclear program. They expressed concern over Iran's provocative steps, such as producing highly enriched uranium and enriched uranium metal, which are important for nuclear weapons programs. They also noted Iran's decreased cooperation and transparency with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The leaders agreed that these actions jeopardize the possibility of a return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and emphasized the importance of a negotiated solution. They welcomed President Biden's commitment to returning the US to full compliance with the JCPOA and urged Iran's President Raisi to seize the opportunity to conclude negotiations. The leaders also acknowledged the regional diplomatic efforts of Gulf partners and affirmed their commitment to addressing broader security concerns posed by Iran's actions. They will continue to work with Russia, China, and the European Union in resolving this critical issue.
