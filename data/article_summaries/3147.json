The Build Back Better Act is a proposed legislation that aims to create millions of well-paying jobs, increase labor force participation, promote long-term growth, reduce price pressures, and help the United States achieve its clean energy goals. The act includes investments in children, families, and caregiving to boost the economy's capacity, as well as initiatives to combat climate change and promote clean energy. It also focuses on providing affordable healthcare to millions of hardworking Americans and aims to lower costs, reduce inflation, and strengthen the middle class. The plan proposes improvements to the immigration system and suggests offsetting costs by asking the largest corporations and highest income Americans to pay their fair share of taxes. The act also aims to prevent profitable corporations from avoiding taxes and rewarding them for shipping jobs overseas. Additionally, it suggests increasing tax compliance and repealing the Trump Administration's rebate rule, which would have raised seniors' drug premiums. The plan is fully funded and does not increase taxes for small businesses or individuals earning less than $400,000 per year. It is expected to generate economic growth, increase tax revenue, and contribute to deficit reduction.
