The White House Press Secretary released a statement on the publication of regulatory changes regarding Cuba. Last month, President Obama announced changes to the Cuba policy, aiming to normalize relations and ease restrictions on American citizens and businesses. The U.S. Departments of the Treasury and Commerce have now published regulatory amendments to existing Cuba sanctions. These changes will allow the American people to provide more resources to empower the Cuban population and help facilitate a growing relationship between the two countries. The statement emphasizes the belief that increased travel, commerce, and information flow will benefit both the United States and ordinary Cubans. The policy of isolation has not worked for over 50 years, and the United States believes that openness is the best way to support its interests and values. The ultimate objective is to promote a more prosperous Cuba that respects the universal rights of its citizens.
