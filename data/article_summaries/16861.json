The statement by NSC Spokesman Mike Hammer acknowledges the tragedy of the Holodomor, where millions of Ukrainians died due to deliberate policies by Joseph Stalin. The Holodomor was a man-made famine caused by the seizure of Ukrainian farms and crops in 1932 and 1933. Despite the attempts to break their will, the Ukrainian people persevered and never gave up hope for self-determination. The statement also recognizes the strength and resilience of the Ukrainian people who endured hardship and emerged stronger. Today, Ukraine is an independent nation, and the United States values the friendship and partnership between the two nations. Both countries are committed to preventing such inhumanity from happening again.
