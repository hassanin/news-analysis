The World Bank Board has approved the establishment of a new Financial Intermediary Fund to address the threat of pandemics. The United States has played a leading role in calling for this mechanism and has pledged $450 million to support the fund. Other partners, including the European Commission, Germany, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and a philanthropic foundation, have also made commitments totaling nearly $1.1 billion. The goal is to increase investments in pandemic preparedness and fill international financing gaps for health security and pandemic preparedness, which experts estimate to be over $10 billion annually. The United States is calling on Congress to provide an additional $4.75 billion in mandatory and discretionary funds to enhance the fund's effectiveness and encourage further commitments from others. The establishment of this fund is seen as a significant milestone in strengthening global health security.
