The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released its 2018 Executive Summary and End-of-Year Report for its Drug-Free Communities (DFC) programs. These programs aim to prevent youth substance use, including prescription drugs, marijuana, tobacco, and alcohol. The report shows that the DFC programs have consistently reduced youth substance use rates. The Trump Administration has made record investments in these programs, awarding the largest number of grants ever last year. The ONDCP Director, Jim Carroll, emphasized the importance of these prevention programs in helping young Americans make the safe and healthy choice not to use drugs. The report also includes substance use rates among youth living in DFCs over the past 30 days since the inception of the program. Links to the Executive Summary, National Evaluation End-of-Year Report, and a map of current DFCs across the country are provided in the article.
