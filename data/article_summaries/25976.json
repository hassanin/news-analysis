First Lady Melania Trump hosted Mrs. Macron, the wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, for a spousal event during their State Visit. They visited the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. and were greeted by the museum's Deputy Director, Frank Kelly. The visit aimed to highlight the work of French artists and the strong friendship between the United States and France. Melania Trump expressed her admiration for the historically famous and beautiful works in the gallery. They admired sculptures originally created for a grove on the grounds of Versailles called the Théâtre d’Eau. They also visited the Cézanne Portraits exhibit, which was particularly relevant to Mrs. Macron's visit. The tour included a stop at the impressionist galleries to admire the work of female American artist Mary Cassatt, who worked among French impressionists in Paris during the 19th century. Finally, they saw Leonardo da Vinci's "Ginevra de' Benci," the only painting by him in the Americas.
