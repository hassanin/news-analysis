In a statement, the Vice President acknowledges that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report confirms the effectiveness of the Recovery Act. The report shows that the Act is successfully initiating infrastructure projects, addressing state budget deficits, and creating job opportunities. The GAO also highlights that the funds are being utilized ahead of schedule and that project bids frequently come in under-budget. This allows for cost-savings, which can be redirected towards communities in need of an economic boost. The Vice President expresses anticipation for receiving reports from recipients of Recovery Act funds next month to further understand the impact on their businesses or organizations. Additionally, he emphasizes the importance of responding to the GAO's recommendations for improving the execution and oversight of the Recovery Act.
