The article is a transcript of a press call discussing the First Lady's upcoming launch of the Better Make Room campaign. The campaign is part of the Reach Higher initiative, which aims to encourage and support young people in pursuing higher education. The First Lady herself is a first-generation college graduate and believes that education can change lives. The Better Make Room campaign specifically targets Generation Z, or young people aged 14 to 19, and aims to celebrate and recognize students who are making higher education a priority in their lives. The campaign includes a fully interactive website where students can create content about their college aspirations and progress, as well as access resources and take action steps such as registering for tests and visiting college campuses. The campaign will have a big launch event at the White House and a rally with LeBron James in Ohio. It also includes partnerships with social media influencers, including those from Vine, to amplify the message and reach students where they are. The campaign emphasizes that post-secondary education can include various options beyond a traditional four-year college degree, such as community college and trade schools. The Better Make Room website, BetterMakeRoom.org, will go live on Monday with the launch of the campaign.
