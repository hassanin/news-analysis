The United States and Italy have successfully completed the removal of approximately 20 kilograms of excess highly enriched uranium (HEU) and separated plutonium from Italy. This was a joint effort that involved complex operations and the development of new technologies. The material was safely packaged and transported with the cooperation of the United Kingdom and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The United States and Italy plan to continue working together to eliminate additional stocks of special nuclear material to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists. They also intend to assist other countries in the international community with the elimination of such materials.
