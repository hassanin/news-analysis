The Air Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA) and other companies have pledged to hire and train 75,000 skilled workers in the next five years. ACCA members are building in-house training centers and launching school-to-career co-op programs to invest in continuing education for their employees and students. Other companies, such as Altec, Amazon, and Boeing, have also committed to workforce development initiatives and training programs. These initiatives aim to create opportunities for all Americans, promote apprenticeships and industry partnerships, and address the changing nature of work in the US.
