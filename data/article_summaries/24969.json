This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the Central African Republic. The national emergency was initially declared on May 12, 2014, due to the threat posed by the breakdown of law and order, sectarian tension, widespread violence, atrocities, and the recruitment and use of child soldiers in the country. The situation in the Central African Republic still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, so the national emergency will continue for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
