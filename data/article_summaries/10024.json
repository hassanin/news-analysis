This article is a proclamation issued by the White House on September 11, 2009, addressing the market disruption caused by imports of certain passenger vehicle and light truck tires from China. The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) had determined that these imports were causing or threatening to cause market disruption to domestic producers. As a result, the President decided to provide import relief in the form of an additional duty on these tires for a period of three years. The additional duty would be 35% ad valorem above the column 1 general rate of duty for the first year, 30% for the second year, and 25% for the third year. The proclamation also stated that these measures would take effect 15 days after the President's determination.
