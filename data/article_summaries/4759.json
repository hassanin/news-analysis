Vice President Kamala Harris addressed the issue of fentanyl and the opioid crisis during a meeting with Attorneys General of the United States. She emphasized the need for a response that addresses both the public health concerns of addiction and treatment, as well as the law enforcement response to trafficking. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is being laced in pills that are often marketed as other drugs, leading to an increase in fatalities, particularly among young people. Harris highlighted the importance of expanding access to treatment, including naloxone, a drug that can save lives. The administration has invested billions of dollars in naloxone and recovery services, and an additional $50 million is being allocated for substance use and treatment. Harris also stressed the need to dismantle transnational criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking and to follow the money trail. She commended state attorneys general for their work in investigating and prosecuting these cases. Finally, Harris called for a destigmatization of substance abuse and a recognition of it as a healthcare issue that requires a well-resourced public health response.
