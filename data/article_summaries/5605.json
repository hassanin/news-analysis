The article highlights the importance of celebrating National Grandparents Day and the significant role grandparents play in providing love, wisdom, and strength to their families. The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly devastating for seniors, with many families losing grandparents to the virus. To honor their memory and protect the vulnerable, a historic vaccination effort has been mobilized, resulting in a high percentage of seniors and adults being fully vaccinated. Despite physical separation during the pandemic, families found creative ways to stay connected, such as video calls and window visits. Grandparents often serve as caregivers, providing support, advice, and care for their grandchildren. The Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act was enacted in 2018 to improve support programs for grandparent and kinship families, and an Advisory Council is set to release its first report with recommendations. President Biden expresses his commitment to identifying needs and providing recommendations to improve the lives of grandparents and the children they support. The article concludes with a call to celebrate the important role of grandparents in families and the love they provide.
