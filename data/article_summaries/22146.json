President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 2016 as National Mental Health Awareness Month in the United States. The proclamation highlights the fact that millions of Americans, including adults and children, experience mental health conditions each year, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress. Despite progress in expanding mental health coverage and raising awareness, many people still do not receive the help they need. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of eliminating the stigma associated with mental illness, encouraging those with mental health conditions to seek help, and ensuring access to the necessary support and resources. The Affordable Care Act has played a significant role in expanding mental health coverage, and the President's recent Budget proposal includes a half-billion dollar investment to further improve access to mental health care. The proclamation also highlights efforts to enhance prevention, early intervention, and treatment of mental illnesses, including the establishment of the Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force and investments in science and research through the BRAIN initiative. Additionally, the proclamation acknowledges the obligation to support veterans who battle mental illness and provides helpline numbers for immediate assistance. The proclamation calls upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, healthcare providers, and research institutions to raise awareness about mental health and continue working towards improving the overall well-being of Americans.
