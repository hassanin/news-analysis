In a recent statement, President Trump announced that he plans to build a steel barrier at the border instead of a concrete wall. He believes that a steel barrier will be less obtrusive and stronger. The President also mentioned that he is considering DACA, but would rather have the Supreme Court rule on it before working with Democrats. He emphasized the need for a strong border due to the crisis of drugs, human trafficking, and criminals crossing the border. President Trump also mentioned the possibility of declaring a national emergency to address the situation. He did not provide specifics on how the wall would be funded or when a decision on declaring a national emergency would be made. The President expressed confidence that government workers would adjust and support border security, despite the ongoing government shutdown.
