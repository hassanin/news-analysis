President Obama has vetoed the "Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act" (JASTA), which would remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism. The President expressed sympathy for the families of the victims of the 9/11 attacks and a commitment to assisting them in their pursuit of justice. However, he argued that JASTA would not protect Americans from terrorist attacks or improve the effectiveness of the U.S. response to such attacks. The President stated that JASTA would reduce the effectiveness of the U.S. response to indications of foreign government support for terrorism by placing matters in the hands of private litigants and courts instead of national security and foreign policy professionals. He also argued that JASTA would upset longstanding international principles regarding sovereign immunity, potentially leading to foreign governments taking reciprocal actions against the United States. Additionally, the President stated that JASTA could create complications in relationships with U.S. allies and partners. In conclusion, he vetoed the bill because it does not contribute to the goals of providing justice for 9/11 victims or enhancing the safety of Americans from terrorist attacks.
