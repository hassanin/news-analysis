On September 29, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order regarding the National Council on Federal Labor-Management Relations (Council) and related agency-level labor-management forums. The order stated that these entities have consumed a significant amount of managerial time and taxpayer resources but have not fulfilled their goal of promoting collaboration in the Federal workforce. As a result, public expenditures on the Council and related forums should be discontinued. The executive order revoked Executive Order 13522, which established the Council and implemented labor-management forums throughout the executive branch. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management and heads of executive departments and agencies were instructed to promptly rescind any orders, rules, regulations, guidelines, programs, or policies implementing or enforcing Executive Order 13522. The order also clarified that it would not abrogate any collective bargaining agreements or impair the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies. It further stated that the order should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. Finally, the order emphasized that it does not create any right or benefit enforceable by any party against the United States or any other person.
