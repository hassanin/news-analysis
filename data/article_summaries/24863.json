Lawrence Eagleburger, a former Secretary of State, passed away and Vice President Joe Biden expressed his condolences. Biden worked with Eagleburger for over three decades and considered him one of the finest Foreign Service Officers of his generation. He praised Eagleburger's candor and straightforward manner, noting that he served loyally under Secretaries from both parties and was the first Foreign Service Officer to become Secretary of State. Biden highlighted Eagleburger's service as Deputy Secretary during important diplomatic events such as the collapse of the Soviet Empire, transitions to democracy in central Europe, the Gulf War, breakthroughs in arms control with the USSR and Russia, and the reunification of Germany. He credited Eagleburger's wise counsel to Secretary James Baker and Congress for contributing to a more stable and secure post-Cold War world, particularly in Europe and Eurasia.
