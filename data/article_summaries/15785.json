President Obama expresses disappointment in the Senate's failure to pass the DREAM Act, which would benefit talented young immigrants seeking to serve the country. He believes that passing the DREAM Act is not only the right thing to do for these individuals but also for the United States as a whole. The President argues that the DREAM Act is important for economic competitiveness, military readiness, and law enforcement efforts. Additionally, he cites a Congressional Budget Office report stating that the DREAM Act would reduce the deficit by $2.2 billion over the next decade. Despite the setback, President Obama pledges to continue working towards fixing the broken immigration system and calls for a serious debate on immigration without polarizing rhetoric. He expresses gratitude to Senators Durbin, Reid, and Menendez for their efforts and affirms his commitment to securing the border while ensuring responsibility and accountability in the immigration system.
