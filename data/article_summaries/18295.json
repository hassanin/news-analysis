The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that Iran has taken the initial steps it committed to as part of the Joint Plan of Action between the P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China) and Iran. These steps include stopping the production of 20% enriched uranium, disabling the centrifuge cascades used to produce it, diluting the existing stockpile of 20% enriched uranium, and not installing additional centrifuges at certain facilities. This is the first time in nearly a decade that Iran has taken verifiable measures to halt progress on its nuclear program. Iran has also increased transparency by allowing more frequent and intrusive inspections and providing more information to the IAEA. In response, the United States and its P5+1 partners will begin to provide the agreed-upon relief to Iran while continuing to enforce remaining sanctions. The next step is to negotiate a long-term, comprehensive solution to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The United States is committed to using diplomacy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
