This article is a transcript of a background briefing given by senior administration officials on the executive order and visa restrictions imposed on Russia in response to their intervention in Ukraine. The officials discuss the actions taken by the United States and the European Union to mobilize international unity, condemn the intervention, impose costs on Russia, and provide support for the government in Kyiv. They explain that the executive order gives the U.S. flexibility to target individuals and entities responsible for the violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They also mention the imposition of visa restrictions on officials and individuals complicit in or supporting actions that threaten Ukraine's sovereignty. The officials emphasize that these measures are meant to send a strong message to Russia and that there is an opportunity for deescalation if Russia pulls back and allows international monitors into Ukraine. They also mention the possibility of further actions if Russia continues to escalate the situation. The officials do not provide specific names of individuals affected by the sanctions, but they state that the U.S. has the ability to target those responsible for supporting destabilizing actions in Crimea. They also mention the possibility of using energy moves to pressure Russia, but do not provide specific details.
