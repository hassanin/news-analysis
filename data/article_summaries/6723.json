President Biden is heading to Somerset, Massachusetts to emphasize the urgency of addressing climate change. He will visit an old coal-fired power plant that has been transformed into a manufacturing hub for undersea cables used in the offshore wind industry. Joining him will be National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy and Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, both Massachusetts natives, as well as several senators and congressmen from the state. 

During the visit, the President will announce executive actions to address climate change, as Congress has not taken sufficient action. One focus will be on investing in heat resilience measures to protect vulnerable populations from extreme heat. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will allocate over $2 billion to support states in building cooling centers and reducing energy costs for those who cannot afford air conditioning.

The President's administration is committed to meeting its emissions reduction targets, and while executive actions alone may not be enough, the private sector's engagement and investment can help accelerate progress. The President believes that a clean energy future is not only necessary for addressing climate change but also presents economic opportunities. The administration will work to ensure that the goals set by the President are not just achieved but exceeded.

In other news, the Senate has cleared a procedural hurdle for the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at lowering prices, strengthening domestic supply chains, and bolstering national security in the semiconductor industry. The White House is encouraged by the bipartisan support for the bill and hopes to get it to the President's desk as soon as possible.

Regarding other legislative matters, the White House supports the bipartisan momentum behind a same-sex marriage bill that passed the House. The President personally champions the right for people to marry whom they love and urges the Senate to act swiftly in passing the bill.

On the issue of abortion access, the White House is considering various options to protect women's reproductive health and rights. The President has signed an executive order and taken other steps to support women's access to healthcare. Further announcements and actions are expected in the coming days.

The President will also be addressing gun violence during an event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, tomorrow. He will discuss building on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which he recently signed into law, to further reduce gun crimes and save lives.
