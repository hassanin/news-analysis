On the 75th anniversary of the Social Security Act, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation to commemorate the importance of this legislation in protecting Americans against poverty and providing income security. The Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 14, 1935, during the Great Depression. At the time, unemployment was high, and many Americans struggled to support themselves and their families. The Social Security Act aimed to provide elderly Americans with income security and work towards a society free from want and fear. Over the years, the program has expanded to include benefits for dependents, survivors, and disabled individuals. It also includes guaranteed medical insurance for seniors through Medicare. President Obama expressed his administration's commitment to strengthening the retirement system and protecting Social Security as a reliable income source for seniors, disabled workers, and dependents. He highlighted the Affordable Care Act as a measure that supports this commitment and improves the long-term outlook of the Social Security program. The proclamation calls on all Americans to observe the 75th anniversary of the Social Security Act with appropriate ceremonies and activities that recognize its historic legacy and the vital safety net it provides to millions of Americans.
