On October 8, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring that the national emergency related to the situation in and in relation to Syria, which was originally declared on October 14, 2019, will continue for another year. The national emergency was declared in response to the actions of the Government of Turkey, specifically their military offensive into northeast Syria, which threatened the campaign to defeat ISIS, endangered civilians, and undermined peace, security, and stability in the region. The continuation of the national emergency is deemed necessary to address the ongoing threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The statement will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
