President Trump issued a presidential memorandum titled "Stopping Counterfeit Trafficking on E-Commerce Platforms Through Fines and Civil Penalties." The memorandum highlights the negative impact of counterfeit goods on American companies, competitiveness, and workers, as well as the health and safety risks to consumers. The policy aims to protect consumers, intellectual property rights holders, businesses, and workers from counterfeit goods on e-commerce platforms. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, is directed to consider appropriate actions under the Tariff Act of 1930 to seize counterfeit goods imported into the United States and impose maximum fines and civil penalties on e-commerce platforms involved in counterfeit trafficking. Within 120 days, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Attorney General, is also required to develop a legislative proposal to support the objectives of the memorandum. The memorandum provides definitions for "e-commerce platform" and "counterfeit goods" and includes general provisions to ensure implementation is consistent with applicable law and subject to appropriations.
