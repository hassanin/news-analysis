President Biden delivered a speech at the South Court Auditorium, where he signed four bills into law that aim to support and honor veterans. The first bill requires the Government Accountability Office to assess whether there are disparities in VA benefits and disability ratings based on race and ethnicity. The second bill, the Hire Veterans Health Heroes Act, directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a program to recruit military medical personnel who have less than a year left in their service to work in federal healthcare occupations. The third bill, the Colonel John M. McHugh Tuition Fairness and Survivors Act, ensures that surviving spouses and children of veterans who access the Survivors' and Dependents' Education Assistance program are eligible for in-state tuition wherever they choose to go to school. The final bill, the Protecting Moms Who Served Act, commissions a comprehensive study of maternal health challenges facing veterans and invests in maternal care coordination programs at the VA. President Biden emphasized the importance of honoring and supporting veterans and their families, stating that it is a sacred obligation of the nation. He thanked the lawmakers who championed these bills and recognized the presence of special guests, including Kelly McHugh Stewart, the daughter of Colonel John M. McHugh. The President highlighted the need to address maternal health challenges faced by women veterans and expressed his commitment to expanding and diversifying the maternal health workforce. He concluded by affirming his dedication to meeting the needs of American mothers who have served.
