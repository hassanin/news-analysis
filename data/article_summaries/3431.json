The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been crucial in providing access to quality and affordable healthcare for millions of Americans. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of the ACA and the need for its improvement. Since February 15, the special enrollment period on HealthCare.gov has allowed one million Americans to sign up for health insurance, giving them peace of mind and security. There is still time for others to enroll, and individuals with existing coverage are encouraged to help their uninsured family and friends. Lowering healthcare costs is also a priority, and the American Rescue Plan has already reduced premiums for nine million Americans, saving families an average of $50 per person per month. Out-of-pocket costs have also decreased significantly. The American Families Plan aims to further enhance affordability, including by making the premium reductions permanent. This milestone demonstrates the demand and necessity for accessible and affordable healthcare in the country, and Congress is urged to pass the American Families Plan promptly.
