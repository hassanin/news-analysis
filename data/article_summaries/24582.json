The article is a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House and the President, regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Somalia. The letter explains that Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act requires the President to publish a notice in the Federal Register and transmit it to Congress within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the declaration of a national emergency, in order for it to continue in effect. President Obama states that he has sent the notice to the Federal Register, stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536 of April 12, 2010, with respect to Somalia, is to continue beyond April 12, 2013. He mentions that the United States recognized the Government of Somalia on January 17, 2013, after not recognizing a government in Somalia for the previous 22 years. However, he emphasizes the importance of maintaining U.S. sanctions against individuals who undermine the stability of Somalia, despite the recognition of the government. President Obama concludes by stating that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and keep the sanctions in place to address this threat.
