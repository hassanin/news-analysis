President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Tennessee due to severe storms, flooding, winds, and tornadoes that occurred in April 2010. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Affected individuals in the counties of Cheatham, Davidson, Hickman, and Williamson can receive assistance such as grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and hazard mitigation statewide. Gracia B. Szczech has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. FEMA will conduct damage surveys, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated based on the assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. Further information can be obtained by contacting FEMA.
