The White House Rural Council recently convened to discuss the challenges facing rural America, including financial stress, mental health, and the opioid epidemic. The President dropped by the meeting to thank the Council and discuss how to better target federal resources to help these communities. The President charged the Council to lead an interagency effort to address these challenges, including financial stress, substance abuse, and increased suicide rates. The President's FY 2017 Budget includes $1 billion in new mandatory funding over two years to expand access to treatment for prescription drug abuse and heroin use. It also includes funding to support cooperative agreements with states, expand access to substance use treatment providers, and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment programs. The Budget also includes funding to expand state-level prescription drug overdose prevention strategies, increase access to medication-assisted treatment programs, improve access to naloxone, and support targeted enforcement activities. Additionally, the Budget includes a pilot project for nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder treatment.
