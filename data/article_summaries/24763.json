First Lady Michelle Obama will be speaking at Detroit's first-ever citywide College Signing Day on May 1, 2015. The event is part of her Reach Higher initiative, which aims to encourage students to pursue higher education. Over 1,500 students from more than 40 Detroit high schools will participate in the rally at Wayne State University. The First Lady will emphasize the importance of students pursuing and completing higher education and will urge them to answer the President's call for America to have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. Grammy award-winning recording artist Ciara, known for her advocacy for education, will also be joining the First Lady at the event. In addition to Detroit, over 400 College Signing Day events have been planned across the country. Education Secretary Arne Duncan will attend a College Signing Day event in Washington, D.C., and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro will attend one in Austin, TX. To celebrate College Signing Day, the First Lady is encouraging people to wear their college apparel and share photos on social media using the hashtag #ReachHigher. The event is open to the press, but space is limited, and media outlets must RSVP to cover the event.
