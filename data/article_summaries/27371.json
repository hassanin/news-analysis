President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Hawaii and authorized Federal assistance to support recovery efforts in areas affected by severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides from April 13 to April 16, 2018. The Federal funding will be available to the State, eligible local governments, and certain private nonprofit organizations for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in the City and County of Honolulu and Kaua ªi County. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for cost-sharing funding. Dolph A. Diemont has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made later based on further damage assessments.
