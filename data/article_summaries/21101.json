Retired Major General Arnold Fields has submitted his resignation as the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). Since his appointment in 2008, General Fields has established offices in Washington, DC and Afghanistan and assembled a team of over 120 professionals. Under his leadership, SIGAR has produced critical reports that have improved reconstruction efforts and ensured that U.S.-funded programs in Afghanistan are achieving their objectives. General Fields' hard work has established SIGAR as a crucial oversight agency. As he moves on to new challenges, the President and the American people are grateful for his courage, leadership, and selfless service to the nation. Going forward, SIGAR will continue to play a fundamental role in protecting the vital interests of the United States, working with Congress to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of U.S. programs in Afghanistan.
