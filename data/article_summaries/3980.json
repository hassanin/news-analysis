President Joseph R. Biden has called for the development of a global health workforce plan to address the critical role and bravery of health and care workers, as well as contribute to the Sustainable Development Agenda. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the global shortage of health workers, with an estimated shortage of 18 million by 2030. To meet the increasing demand for health workers, strategic and sustained investments are needed to ensure a comprehensive, trained, protected, well-equipped, and supported workforce. Such investments not only improve health outcomes but also create jobs, stimulate economic development, and strengthen human capital. The funding advancements will support the fight against COVID-19, promote economic recovery, and strengthen global health systems. The U.S. government currently contributes around $1.56 billion annually to support the health workforce globally through various programs. The President's Fiscal Year 2023 Budget includes an additional $1 billion for a new Global Health Worker Initiative, which will define health workers broadly and guide the U.S. government's investments and coordination with key partners. The initiative focuses on protecting health workers, expanding the global health workforce, advancing equity and inclusion, and driving technological advancements and innovation. By prioritizing these pillars, the U.S. government aims to strengthen the global health workforce and contribute to achieving sustainable development goals.
