On June 14, 2023, the President signed a new law called the "Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2023" or the "Veterans' COLA Act of 2023." This law grants a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for veterans' disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation beneficiaries, which will be equivalent to the Social Security COLA. The President expressed gratitude to Senators Tester and Moran, as well as Representatives Pappas and Luttrell, for their leadership in this matter.
