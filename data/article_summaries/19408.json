The White House Office of the First Lady will be hosting a press preview in the State Dining Room for the State Dinner in honor of the Official Visit of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and his wife, Mrs. Agnese Landini, of Italy. There will be an opportunity for photos and video footage of sample place settings, and officials will be available to answer questions. However, the First Lady will not be in attendance. 

As part of a spousal program for the Italy Official Visit, First Lady Michelle Obama and Mrs. Agnese Landini will tour the White House Kitchen Garden. The tour will include a special performance by students from a local Turnaround Arts school. Turnaround Arts is a national program that aims to transform low-performing schools through comprehensive and integrated arts education. The First Lady serves as the honorary chair of the program, which has empowered 68 schools in 27 districts across 13 states and Washington, DC since 2011.
