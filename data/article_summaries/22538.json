This article is about an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in 2012, which establishes an order of succession within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The order outlines the officials who will act as and perform the functions and duties of the Administrator of the EPA in the event that the Administrator and Deputy Administrator are unable to fulfill their roles. The order also states that individuals serving in an acting capacity cannot act as Administrator, and that the President has the discretion to depart from the order in designating an acting Administrator. Additionally, the order revokes two previous executive orders related to succession in the EPA. It is noted that this order does not create any rights or benefits enforceable by any party.
