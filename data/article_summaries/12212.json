The White House Press Secretary issued a statement expressing disappointment in Republicans for blocking the Veterans Jobs Corps plan, which aims to put tens of thousands of veterans back to work. The Obama Administration has already made progress in helping veterans find jobs through tax credits and tools to connect them with employers. The statement also highlights the efforts of the First Lady and Dr. Biden's Joining Forces Initiative, which has led to over 2,000 businesses hiring or training more than 125,000 veterans and military spouses in the past year. The administration believes more can be done, and Senate Republicans should not stand in the way of legislation that includes their own ideas and opportunities for veterans to secure good jobs.
