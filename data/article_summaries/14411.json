In this article, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum directing the transfer of ultra-low sulfur diesel oil (ULSD) from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve to the Department of Defense. This transfer is intended to provide immediate relief to communities affected by Hurricane Sandy, which caused severe damage to the petroleum refining and distribution sector on the East Coast. The President based this decision on advice from the Secretary of Energy and the impact of the hurricane on supply and distribution channels. The Secretary of Energy has the authority to cancel the transfer if circumstances change.
