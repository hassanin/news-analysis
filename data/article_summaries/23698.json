On June 22nd, First Lady Michelle Obama and several Cabinet secretaries and senior administration officials will kick off the United We Serve summer service initiative by participating in service projects across the country. This initiative is a call to all Americans to engage in sustained, meaningful community service and runs from June 22nd to September 11th. The projects will be led by the Corporation for National and Community Service, and Americans can visit their website, www.serve.gov, to find and create service projects in their communities. Some of the projects include constructing a public playground in San Francisco, visiting wounded warriors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and working with volunteers to rebuild homes in New Orleans. The article provides a detailed schedule of the service projects and the locations where they will take place.
