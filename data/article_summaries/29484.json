President Trump is expected to issue an executive order directing federal agencies to enforce the First Amendment more aggressively on college campuses. The order would require public educational institutions to comply with the First Amendment, and private institutions to uphold their own free speech standards. This move is seen as a response to allegations that conservatives on campuses are being silenced. The order also includes a provision for the government to collect more detailed data on the debt and earnings of college graduates, allowing prospective students to make more informed decisions about their education. The administration believes that providing more information about the value of a college degree is a better approach than punishing institutions.
