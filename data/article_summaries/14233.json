In a phone call, President Obama spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe about North Korea's nuclear test and discussed steps to respond to this violation. They agreed to work together to seek action at the United Nations Security Council and to cooperate on measures to impede North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. President Obama also reassured Japan of the United States' defense commitments, including the extended deterrence offered by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. They plan to have further discussions during the Prime Minister's upcoming visit to Washington.
