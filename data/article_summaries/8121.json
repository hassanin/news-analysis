The House has taken an important step in advancing two bipartisan bills that aim to make vital investments in research and development (R&D), science, and economic competitiveness. The National Science Foundation for the Future Act and the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act will help address major challenges such as the climate crisis. The article emphasizes the need for historic investments in R&D, innovation, the semiconductor industry, and advanced manufacturing to compete with countries like China. The Senate has already passed investments in domestic strength through the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, and the House's bipartisan investments in R&D and science further demonstrate the country's commitment to making transformative investments. The Biden Administration looks forward to working with the House and Senate to produce a final bill that can be signed into law.
