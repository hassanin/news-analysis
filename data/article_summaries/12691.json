The United States, along with the European Union and other partners, has been engaged in diplomatic efforts with Iran to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon. In November, an initial agreement was reached, known as the Joint Plan of Action, in which Iran agreed to halt and roll back aspects of its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Iran has fulfilled its commitments under the agreement, and international inspectors have verified this. However, the majority of sanctions remain in place. The goal is to reach a comprehensive deal that ensures Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful. Negotiations have made progress, but there are still gaps to be addressed. The Joint Plan of Action has been extended until November 24 to allow for further negotiations and to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear program during this time. The aim is to impose strict limits on Iran's enrichment capacity and facilities, address concerns with its Arak reactor, and establish verification measures to detect any covert activities. The US has consulted with Congress, regional partners, and allies throughout this process. The sanctions regime will continue to be enforced. The hope is to achieve a lasting diplomatic solution that resolves the national security issue of Iran's nuclear program.
