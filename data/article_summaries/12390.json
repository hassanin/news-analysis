On June 9, 2010, the President signed several bills into law. One of them is the "Special Agent Samuel Hicks Families of Fallen Heroes Act," which provides payment for the transportation and moving expenses for the immediate family of certain Federal employees who die in the line of duty. Other bills signed include designations for various United States Postal Service facilities, such as the "Private First Class Garfield M. Langhorn Post Office Building" in Riverhead, New York, and the "George Kell Post Office" in Swifton, Arkansas. Additionally, a bill was signed that extends the provision for limited civil antitrust liability for participants in the Justice Department's corporate leniency program until June 22, 2020. This program protects companies from criminal prosecution for antitrust violations if they are the first to come forward and cooperate with the Department's investigation.
