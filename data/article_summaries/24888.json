On August 11, 2010, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 5872, known as the "General and Special Risk Insurance Funds Availability Act of 2010," provides the Department of Housing and Urban Development with an additional $5 billion in commitment authority. This authority is used to guarantee loans that are obligations of the General and Special Risk Insurance Funds. The second bill, H.R. 5981, grants the Department of Housing and Urban Development increased flexibility in charging and establishing mortgage insurance premiums for certain loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
