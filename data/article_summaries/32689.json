On April 16, 2019, the President signed two bills into law. The first is H.R. 2030, known as the "Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan Authorization Act." This law instructs the Secretary of the Interior to implement agreements related to the management and operations of the Colorado River during times of drought. The second bill, S. 725, changes the address of a postal facility that was named in honor of Captain Humayun Khan.
