President Obama has announced new measures to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families are treated fairly when using their federal education benefits. These measures include establishing a pilot program to inform school choice, improving data-sharing among federal agencies, expanding the use of online tools, promoting military apprenticeship programs, amending the Post-9/11 GI Bill, cracking down on deceptive marketing, and formalizing collaboration across the government. The President has also highlighted the progress made in the areas of health care, benefits, homelessness, economic opportunity, and resources and transformation at the VA. In addition, the Administration has announced three milestones, including ending veteran homelessness in the state of Delaware, increasing federal hiring of veterans, and increasing data sharing to promote transparency for veterans and students. These efforts build on the progress made over the past eight years in fulfilling promises to veterans and ensuring their success in civilian life.
