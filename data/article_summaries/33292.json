President Trump has been transparent, principled, and consistent in his approach to nominating a Supreme Court Justice. He provided the American people with a list of possible candidates as early as May 2016 and finalized the list to include 21 candidates in September. He promised to choose only from this list when selecting future Justices. Trump also stated that his nominee would uphold the rule of law and represent the principles espoused by the late Justice Scalia.
