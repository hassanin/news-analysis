On June 8, 2010, President Barack Obama issued a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans, which was declared on June 26, 2001, will continue for another year. The national emergency was initially declared due to the threat posed by extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia and other parts of the Western Balkans region, as well as acts obstructing the implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia and the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 in Kosovo. The President believes that the actions of individuals threatening peace and international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
