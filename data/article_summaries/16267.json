The President's Task Force on the Status of Puerto Rico held its first meeting to examine the issue of Puerto Rico's status and also expanded its scope to include issues affecting Puerto Rico's economic development. The Task Force was created by President Obama through an executive order to provide advice and recommendations on policy measures to promote job creation, education, healthcare, clean energy, and economic development on the island. The Task Force will hold public hearings in Puerto Rico and the continental United States to gather input from the public. The Task Force is composed of members appointed by each member of the presidential cabinet and co-chaired by Cecilia Mu√±oz, Director of Intergovernmental Affairs at the White House, and Tom Perrelli, Deputy Attorney General.
