President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Oklahoma, authorizing federal aid to assist in recovery efforts from a severe winter storm that occurred in December 2009. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Canadian, Cleveland, Comanche, Cotton, Craig, Delaware, Garvin, Grady, Hughes, Jackson, Jefferson, Kay, Lincoln, Love, McClain, Muskogee, Noble, Nowata, Okfuskee, Okmulgee, Ottawa, Payne, Pontotoc, Pottawatomie, Rogers, Sequoyah, Stephens, Tillman, and Tulsa. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will be coordinating federal recovery operations, and additional counties may receive assistance once damage assessments are completed.
