Yesterday, a meeting was held between Erika Moritsugu, Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) Liaison, and AA and NHPI leaders to discuss reproductive health and rights. The participants emphasized the negative impact that overturning Roe v. Wade would have on AA and NHPI communities, as they strongly support reproductive rights. They highlighted the importance of an intersectional approach that focuses on accessibility, language access, and cultural competency in ensuring reproductive freedom. Senior Administration officials reiterated the President and Vice President's commitment to supporting reproductive health and rights and involving the diverse AA and NHPI communities in important discussions. Various organizations, including the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, and Empowering Pacific Islander Communities, were represented at the meeting.
