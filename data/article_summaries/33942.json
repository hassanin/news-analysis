On January 23, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation implementing safeguard measures on certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) products. The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) had previously determined that these products were being imported in increased quantities, causing serious injury to the domestic industry. The safeguard measures include a tariff-rate quota on imports of solar cells and an increase in duties on imports of modules. The measures will be in effect for a period of 4 years. However, developing countries that are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and have a share of total imports below 3 percent are excluded from these measures. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is authorized to revise the list of excluded countries if necessary. The proclamation also includes technical corrections to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) related to the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The modifications to the HTS will take effect on February 7, 2018, and will continue as specified in the proclamation.
