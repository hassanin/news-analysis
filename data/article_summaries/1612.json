Minnesota has become the first state in 2023 to codify the protections of Roe v. Wade into law, with Governor Tim Walz signing the bill. This move reflects the overwhelming support among Americans for a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions, as evidenced by the defense of access to abortion in various states during the last fall's elections. While Congressional Republicans continue to support extreme policies like a national abortion ban, President Biden and Vice President Harris are urging Congress to restore the protections of Roe through federal law. In the meantime, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue working to protect access to abortion and supporting state leaders in defending women's reproductive rights. State leaders across the country are also taking steps to protect patients and healthcare providers, ensure access to care through funding and training, strengthen privacy protections, and expand access to contraception.
