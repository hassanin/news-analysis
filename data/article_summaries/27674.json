The article discusses the executive orders issued by President Donald Trump on August 3, 2020, regarding healthcare, specifically focusing on improving access to healthcare in rural communities. The purpose of the orders is to address the challenges faced by Americans living in rural areas when seeking healthcare services, such as limited transportation, healthcare worker shortages, and limited access to technological and care-delivery innovations. The article highlights that the gap in health outcomes between rural and urban Americans has widened in recent years. It also mentions that since 2010, 129 rural hospitals in the United States have closed due to financial distress and lack of patient volume. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for better access to healthcare in rural areas, and the use of telehealth has increased significantly during this time. The executive orders aim to increase access to high-quality care through telehealth, launch an innovative payment model for rural healthcare providers, invest in physical and communications infrastructure, improve the health of rural Americans, and expand flexibilities beyond the public health emergency. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has been given specific timelines to develop strategies, submit reports, and propose regulations to implement these orders. The orders are to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
