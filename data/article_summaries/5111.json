The author expresses disappointment over the recent decision to strike down their student debt relief plan. They argue that this plan would have provided much-needed assistance to millions of Americans recovering from the pandemic. The relief would have primarily benefited those making less than $75,000 a year, with no assistance going to those making over $125,000. The author criticizes Republican elected officials for their hypocrisy, citing their support for pandemic-related loans to businesses while opposing relief for individuals. Despite the setback, the author emphasizes the progress made in increasing Pell Grants, forgiving loans for public service workers, and implementing a new debt repayment plan. They vow to continue working towards delivering relief to middle-class families and ensuring equal access to higher education. The author promises to provide more details on their administration's efforts in helping students and their next steps.
