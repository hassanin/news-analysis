The President's statement emphasizes the importance of HIV testing and the ongoing fight against HIV/AIDS. There are over 1.1 million Americans living with HIV, and more than 200,000 are unaware of their infection. Testing is crucial in order to access life-extending treatment, which has become more effective due to ongoing research. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy, released in 2010, focuses on reducing infections, improving health outcomes, and reducing disparities. Testing is a priority, and thanks to quick and accurate tests, finding out one's HIV status has never been easier. The Affordable Care Act now requires many health insurance plans to provide recommended preventive health services, including HIV testing, with no out-of-pocket costs. The Expanding Testing Initiative by the CDC has conducted 2.8 million tests in its first three years. These efforts aim to prevent new infections and move towards an AIDS-free generation.
