A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that the rates of childhood obesity are declining among children ages two to five. The study found a 43% drop in the obesity rate among preschool-age children over the past decade. This is seen as a significant achievement and is attributed to the efforts of various stakeholders, including parents, teachers, doctors, and community leaders. The First Lady's Let's Move! initiative, which is celebrating its fourth anniversary, has made early childhood a top priority and has implemented programs to promote healthy habits in child care and early education settings. While progress has been made, there is still work to be done. The article provides four simple tips for parents to help keep their kids healthy, including breastfeeding if possible, serving fruits and vegetables, providing water or low-fat milk, and ensuring at least 60 minutes of active play per day.
