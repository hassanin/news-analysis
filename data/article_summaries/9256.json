The article highlights the strong performance of the American economy, with a 4.9% growth in the third quarter. It emphasizes the belief that a recession is not necessary to combat inflation, as the economy continues to grow while inflation decreases. The author credits this resilience to American consumers and workers, supported by Bidenomics, a plan to grow the economy by strengthening the middle class. The article also mentions positive indicators such as low unemployment rates, increased real wages, and a growth in median wealth for American families. Additionally, it highlights a recent agreement between the UAW and Ford that provides a record raise to auto workers. The author calls on Republicans in Congress to support and build on this progress, rather than risking the economy with threats of a shutdown or tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.
