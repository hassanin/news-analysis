On April 16, 2015, the President signed into law H.R. 2, also known as the "Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015". This law replaces Medicare's sustainable growth rate system for physician payments and reforms Medicare physician payment policies to promote efficient and high-quality care. It also extends funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program for two years, along with several other expiring health provisions and the Secure Rural Schools program. Additionally, the law removes Social Security numbers from Medicare cards and includes other improvements to the Medicare system.
