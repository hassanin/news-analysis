President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Iowa and has ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding occurred from August 23-27, 2016. Federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding. David G. Samaniego has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and further damage assessments warrant it. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
