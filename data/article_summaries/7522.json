On June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress adopted a flag for the United States of America, consisting of 13 alternating red and white stripes and 13 stars on a blue field. Over the years, the stars have grown to represent the 50 states of the country. The American flag is seen as a symbol of freedom, opportunity, and hope, and is celebrated on Flag Day and during National Flag Week. The flag represents the diverse cultures, backgrounds, and beliefs of all Americans and has been a symbol of democracy both at home and abroad. It has been flown in times of war and peace, traveled to the Moon and Mars, and waved above important buildings and locations. The flag holds special significance for American service members, who have fought bravely under its symbol, and honors those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. The flag serves as a reminder of the ideals and values upon which the nation was founded. To commemorate Flag Day, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed June 14, 2022, as Flag Day and the week starting June 12, 2022, as National Flag Week. He encourages all Americans to display the flag and honor service members during this time, and to observe the days leading up to Independence Day as a time to celebrate American history and values.
