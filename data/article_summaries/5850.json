The US government took immediate action to prepare for Tropical Storm Hilary. FEMA deployed federal personnel and supplies to impacted communities in California, and the US Coast Guard pre-positioned aircraft for rapid response and search-and-rescue efforts. Federal personnel were also deployed to Nevada for additional support. The government will continue to coordinate with California, Nevada, and Arizona for any necessary resources. President Trump spoke with California Governor Gavin Newsom about emergency preparedness measures and the initial response to the storm. The government is monitoring the earthquake that occurred in Southern California and its impacts. Additional assistance will be provided as requested, and people are urged to take the storm and earthquake seriously and listen to state and local officials.
