The rail industry in the United States has committed to hiring over 5,000 veterans in 2012, according to an announcement by Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, Association of American Railroads (AAR) President and CEO Ed Hamberger, and Joining Forces Executive Director Brad Cooper. This commitment is part of the Joining Forces initiative launched by the First Lady and Dr. Biden to support veterans and military families. Over 1,600 companies have hired more than 90,000 veterans and military spouses in the past year through Joining Forces. The rail industry sees veterans as having the right skills and training for successful careers in transportation, given their experience with heavy machinery, safety operations, teamwork, and adaptability. With approximately 23% of the railroad workforce eligible to retire by 2015, the industry is looking to veterans to fill the jobs that will become available. Freight railroads plan to hire at least 4,700 veterans in 2012, inter-city passenger and commuter railroads plan to hire approximately 500 veterans, and rail supply companies represented by AAR have committed to hiring at least 200 veterans. The AAR is also collaborating with the Department of Transportation to list available rail industry jobs on the "Veteran Transportation Career Center" website.
