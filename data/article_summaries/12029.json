President Obama has declared a major disaster in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands due to Typhoon Soudelor. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to affected individuals and businesses. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover property losses, and other recovery programs. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is conducting damage surveys, and additional assistance may be designated once assessments are completed. Residents and business owners can apply for assistance online or by phone. For further information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
