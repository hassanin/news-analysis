The United States has significantly reduced childhood fatalities related to accidental poisoning, from 200 deaths per year to 27 per year, which is an 88% decline. President Donald Trump has proclaimed March 19 through March 25, 2017, as National Poison Prevention Week, urging Americans to take actions to safeguard their families from poisonous products, chemicals, and medicines found in their homes. This proclamation is a continuation of successful policies that have helped reduce accidental childhood poisonings and injuries.
