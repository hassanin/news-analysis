The United States and Mexico have pledged to work together to address security challenges and combat organized crime. Both countries recognize the shared responsibility to confront issues such as substance addiction, gun violence, drug trafficking, human smuggling, and organized crime. They aim to develop a coordinated, regional approach with a focus on public health and development. The goal is to create a culture of peace, prevent crime, and address the root causes of criminal activity. The partnership emphasizes the protection of human rights, intolerance for corruption, and the use of new methods and technology to fight organized crime. Concrete actions include reducing substance abuse, creating a Network for Homicide Prevention, strengthening control of precursor chemicals, combating arms trafficking, countering human smuggling and trafficking, and targeting illicit actors and their financial networks. Both countries also commit to advancing human rights and forensic cooperation to address cases of disappearances and forced disappearances.
