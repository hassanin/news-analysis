President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation terminating India's designation as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) effective June 5, 2019. This decision was made based on India's failure to assure the United States of equitable and reasonable access to its markets. The proclamation also removes India from the list of developing country World Trade Organization (WTO) members exempt from safeguard measures on certain products. The safeguard measures were implemented to address increased imports that cause serious injury to domestic industries. Furthermore, any merchandise from India admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after June 5, 2019, will be subject to the safeguard measures.
