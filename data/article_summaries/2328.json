On National Maritime Day, President Biden honors the merchant mariners who serve on U.S. vessels worldwide. These mariners play a crucial role in transporting equipment, troops, and goods during peacetime and war, contributing to the safety and strength of the country. Throughout history, merchant mariners have supported the nation, including during the Revolutionary War and World War II, where they volunteered to transport essential supplies and made sacrifices for freedom. In the present day, they continue to move billions of dollars' worth of cargo and support military operations. The Biden administration supports the Merchant Marine and the Jones Act, which benefits American workers in the maritime industry. Investments are being made to improve maritime supply chains and support Merchant Marine officers. Efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the industry are also being advanced. National Maritime Day, designated by Congress, commemorates the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship in 1819. President Biden calls upon all Americans to observe this day and celebrate the United States Merchant Marine and maritime industry.
