This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama in 2012, focuses on driving innovation and creating jobs in rural America through the procurement of biobased and sustainable products. It highlights the BioPreferred program, established by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, as a means to increase federal procurement of biobased products and promote rural economic development. The memorandum directs executive departments and agencies to effectively execute federal procurement requirements for biobased products, including those identified in Executive Order 13514 and prescribed in the 2002 and 2008 Farm Bills. It also emphasizes the need for agencies to include and report on biobased acquisition as part of their sustainable acquisition goals and milestones. The memorandum further outlines actions to increase the number of designated biobased products eligible for preferred purchasing and to make changes in procurement mechanisms to facilitate compliance with biobased product requirements. It also addresses small business assistance, reporting on biobased product purchases, job creation research, and education and outreach efforts. The memorandum concludes by providing general provisions for its application and publication.
