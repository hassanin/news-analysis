This executive order, issued by President Barack Obama on May 15, 2013, amends the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States. Parts III and IV of the manual are specifically amended, as described in the attached Annex. These amendments take effect immediately, but they do not apply retroactively. This means that any act done or omitted prior to the effective date of this order, which was not punishable at that time, cannot be punished under these amendments. Additionally, any ongoing nonjudicial punishment proceedings, restraint, investigation, referral of charges, or trial that began before the effective date of this order can continue unaffected by these amendments.
