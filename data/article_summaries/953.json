On May 22, 2003, President Biden declared a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat to national security and foreign policy posed by obstacles to the reconstruction, peace, and development of institutions in Iraq. The obstacles in Iraq continue to pose a threat, so the national emergency declared in 2003 will remain in effect beyond May 22, 2022. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, and the notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
