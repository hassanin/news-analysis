Xiyue Wang, a Princeton University graduate student who had been held prisoner in Iran since August 2016, is finally returning to the United States. He was held under the pretense of espionage. The United States expresses gratitude to its Swiss partners for their assistance in negotiating Wang's release with Iran. The safety and well-being of American citizens is the highest priority for the US government, and efforts to bring home all citizens wrongfully held captive overseas will continue.
