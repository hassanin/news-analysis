The Biden Administration is launching a whole-of-government initiative to provide accessible and actionable information to individuals and communities affected by climate impacts such as flooding, droughts, wildfires, and extreme heat. The effort aims to empower communities to better prepare and become more resilient to climate risks. The initiative includes the launch of a redesigned version of NOAA's Climate.gov website, interagency reports on climate information services, federal mapping services for climate planning and resilience, potential revisions to minimum floodplain management standards, climate research funding and community roundtables, and social science support from the National Science Foundation. These efforts align with President Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad and aim to enhance understanding of climate risks and support decision-making based on science and data.
