Retired Navy Lt. John William Finn, the oldest living Medal of Honor recipient, has passed away. President Obama expresses his sadness and offers condolences to Finn's family. Finn received the Medal of Honor for his heroism during the attack on Pearl Harbor, where he defended his fellow sailors under heavy gunfire for two hours despite being seriously wounded. Finn never considered himself a hero, but his actions serve as an extraordinary example for all Americans. President Obama had the privilege of meeting Finn and was struck by his warmth and humility. As Memorial Day is observed, Finn's passing serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by generations to preserve our freedoms.
