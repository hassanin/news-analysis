In this article, President Joe Biden proclaims November 2023 as National Adoption Month and highlights the importance of providing safe and loving homes for children. He emphasizes the need to help more families cover the cost of adoption by making the adoption tax credit fully refundable, regardless of income. The President also proposes making legal guardians eligible for support, allowing extended family members to care for children and keep families together. He mentions the expansion of the Military Parental Leave Program to give service members more time with their families after a child is born, adopted, or placed through foster care.

The President recognizes and celebrates adoptive and kinship families, foster families, and professionals who contribute to the adoption process. He encourages anyone considering adoption to take that step forward and grow their families. The proclamation concludes by urging Americans to help children and youth in their communities find forever homes and the love and connection they need to thrive.
