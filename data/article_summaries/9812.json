The President has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, requesting that Congress consider amendments to the FY 2011 Budget for various departments and organizations. The amendments would not increase the proposed totals in the President's budget. The letter also includes amendments for the Legislative Branch and a request to fund an initiative for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to spur economic growth and job creation in the Florida Space Coast and other affected regions. The details of these requests are provided in a letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
