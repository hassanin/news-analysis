President Biden and G7 leaders have met to discuss strategic competition with China and address infrastructure needs in low- and middle-income countries. They have agreed to launch a global infrastructure initiative called Build Back Better World (B3W). B3W aims to mobilize private-sector capital in areas such as climate, health, digital technology, and gender equity. The initiative will cover low- and middle-income countries worldwide. The United States will lead the partnership and utilize its development finance tools to complement domestic infrastructure investments and create job opportunities. The goal is to catalyze hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment in the coming years. The guiding principles of B3W will be outlined in the G7 Leaders' Communique.
