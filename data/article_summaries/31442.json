President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of South Dakota due to a severe winter storm, snowstorm, and flooding that occurred from March 13 to April 26, 2019. Federal assistance will be provided to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals and grants for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, can also receive federal funding for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Additional designations may be made later based on further damage assessments. James R. Stephenson has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
