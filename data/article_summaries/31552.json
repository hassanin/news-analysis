In an op-ed for the Tampa Bay Times, Steven T. Mnuchin, the Secretary of the Treasury, highlights the positive impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was passed six months ago. Mnuchin states that the economy is experiencing an economic renewal, with GDP growing faster than it has in a decade and unemployment at historically low levels. He attributes this success to the tax cuts, which have inspired optimism and created greater opportunities for Americans. Mnuchin also mentions that hundreds of billions of dollars in investments are flowing into the country, and millions of jobs are being created. He concludes by stating that the tax cuts are fulfilling their goals of allowing people to keep more of what they earn and improving the business environment, and that the positive results are already being seen.
