This week, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which is considered the most significant legislation to reduce gun violence in 30 years. The event was attended by Members of Congress, state and local leaders, gun violence survivors, families, and advocates. Biden stated that this measure will save lives.

Another event at the White House was the American Rescue Plan Summit, where Vice President Harris, Labor Secretary Walsh, and other officials discussed how more than $40 billion of American Rescue Plan funds have been allocated to strengthen and expand the workforce in various states. The aim is to support the COVID-19 economic recovery.

Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu highlighted President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law during a visit to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The law focuses on rebuilding infrastructure, improving roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes for clean water, expanding high-speed internet, and creating millions of good-paying union jobs.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo led a press call to emphasize the urgent need for Congress to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act. This act aims to spur American manufacturing, strengthen supply chains, and lower costs for families.

Overall, these events and initiatives demonstrate the Biden administration's focus on gun control, economic recovery, infrastructure development, and innovation.
