The White House has announced that President Obama will be hosting leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at Sunnylands in Rancho Mirage, California on February 15-16, 2016. This gathering marks the first time the United States has hosted the ASEAN leaders and aims to strengthen the partnership between the two. The summit will focus on political, security, and economic issues, and further advance the Administration's rebalance to Asia and the Pacific. The United States and ASEAN have been working together for nearly 40 years to promote stability, prosperity, and peace in Southeast Asia.
