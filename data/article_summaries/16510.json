This article is a memorandum from President Barack Obama regarding the determination of Iran's oil supply. The President states that after considering various factors, including global economic conditions and increased oil production by certain countries, he has determined that there is enough petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. As a result, there can be a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by foreign financial institutions. The President will continue to monitor the situation to ensure the market can accommodate this reduction. The Secretary of State is instructed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
