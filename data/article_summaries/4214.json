The Biden-Harris Administration is recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility and taking action to support transgender individuals. They condemn anti-transgender legislative attacks and emphasize the importance of allowing individuals to be themselves. The Justice Department is reinforcing federal protections for transgender youth, while the administration is also working to improve the traveler experience for transgender individuals. Resources are being provided to support transgender children and their families, and efforts are being made to improve access to federal services and benefits for transgender Americans. Additionally, actions are being taken to advance inclusion and visibility of transgender individuals in federal data. These announcements build on the administration's previous work to advance equality for transgender Americans in various areas such as combatting legislative attacks, civil rights protections, supporting service members and veterans, addressing anti-transgender violence, promoting healthcare access, supporting students and families, promoting fair housing and ending homelessness, advancing economic opportunity and protections for workers, and promoting gender equity and transgender equality.
