On the anniversary of the Olmstead v. L.C. Supreme Court decision, President Obama highlighted the administration's efforts to assist Americans with disabilities. The decision affirmed the right of Americans with disabilities to live independently. The administration has taken several steps towards achieving this goal, including improving access to affordable housing, community supports, and independent living arrangements. The Health and Human Services Secretary and Housing and Urban Development Secretary have worked together to launch initiatives such as increasing Section 8 vouchers and enhancing interagency coordination. The administration has also implemented the Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration Program, which provides funding to states to increase the use of home and community-based services for eligible individuals. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division has taken legal action to ensure that people with disabilities can leave institutional living arrangements and receive services in supported housing and other community settings. The administration is also commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act with various events.
