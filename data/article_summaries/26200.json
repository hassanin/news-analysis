President Trump has been systematically overturning regulations and policies put in place during the Obama administration. He has signed an executive order to review and potentially dismantle the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to curb carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Trump has also lifted a halt on new coal leases on federal lands. In addition, he is expected to sign legislation allowing states to withhold federal family planning funds from Planned Parenthood affiliates and other abortion clinics. Trump has given the green light to the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which was previously rejected by Obama, and has allowed the Dakota Access Pipeline to continue construction. The Trump administration is re-evaluating fuel efficiency standards set by the Obama administration for cars and trucks. Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and reinstated a ban on providing federal money to international groups that perform abortions or provide information about them. Lastly, Trump has delayed an Obama-era rule that would require financial professionals to prioritize their clients' best interests when advising on retirement investments.
