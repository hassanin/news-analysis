President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has vetoed H.J. Res. 30, a resolution that aimed to disapprove of the Department of Labor's final rule titled "Prudence and Loyalty in Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights." The President's decision to veto the resolution is based on the belief that the Department of Labor's final rule protects the savings and pensions of workers and retirees by allowing retirement plan fiduciaries to make informed investment decisions. The final rule ensures that all relevant factors, including environmental, social, and governance factors, are considered in investment decisions to maximize financial returns for retirees. The President argues that the resolution would force retirement managers to ignore these risk factors, potentially jeopardizing the life savings of working families and retirees. He believes that retirement plan fiduciaries should be able to consider any factor that maximizes financial returns for retirees, including factors related to climate change and corporate governance. President Biden sees his decision to veto the resolution as a common-sense approach to protecting the interests of retirees across the country.
