Senator Tuberville of Alabama has ended his hold on hundreds of military nominations after 10 months, allowing 425 military leaders to be confirmed by the Senate. The confirmations were long overdue and should never have been delayed in the first place. The hold had undermined military readiness and morale, and the delay had hurt servicemembers and military families. It is hoped that this move will allow military leaders to take their next posts and military families to make plans for the future. The Senate is urged to swiftly confirm the remaining appointees.
