President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Alaska due to a severe storm that occurred in November 2011. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected area, specifically the Kenai Peninsula Borough. The federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Willie G. Nunn has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
