Second Lady Karen Pence participated in a roundtable discussion on veteran suicide prevention efforts in Arizona. She emphasized the importance of addressing veteran suicide and commended the Arizona Coalition for Military Families and Arizona Department of Veterans' Services for their comprehensive approach to preventing suicide among veterans. Mrs. Pence also heard personal testimonials from veterans who had struggled with suicidal thoughts and benefited from services available in Arizona. The participants of the roundtable have spearheaded the Be Connected initiative, which brings together leaders from across Arizona to address veteran suicide using an upstream prevention approach. The initiative has influenced organizations like PREVENTS to create comprehensive approaches to helping veterans with suicidal thoughts. President Trump signed an executive order in 2019 establishing PREVENTS, a three-year effort to empower veterans and prevent suicide. Mrs. Pence serves as the Lead Ambassador for PREVENTS and has been traveling across the country to raise awareness about suicide prevention for veterans and all Americans.
