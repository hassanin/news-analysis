The press gaggle by Press Secretary Josh Earnest on January 14, 2015, covers a few different topics. First, President Obama called head Coach Urban Meyer from the National Champion Ohio State University football team to congratulate him on their victory and invite the team to the White House. The President is also traveling to Cedar Falls, Iowa to discuss broadband access and how one community has improved it. The President believes that more communities should have the opportunity to do the same and will use executive authority to help them. The press gaggle also mentions the House Republicans voting in protest over the President's executive action on immigration reform. The President's reform plan would bring accountability to the broken immigration system and focus law enforcement resources on felons and threats to public safety. The vote is seen as bad policy and bad politics, as it is unlikely to pass the Senate and could interfere with funding for the Department of Homeland Security. The article also mentions the President's upcoming State of the Union address and his work on issues such as trade and climate change. Finally, the press gaggle briefly mentions the terror attack in Paris and the President's meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron.
