The White House has announced a series of public and private sector efforts aimed at increasing community resilience through building codes and standards. The impacts of climate change pose significant challenges for buildings and homes, many of which were not built to withstand future impacts. The federal government is taking actions such as reviewing existing building construction requirements, updating hazard mitigation studies, and exploring the adoption and enforcement of building codes. Private sector organizations are also committing to incorporating resilience into their practices and developing resources to help professionals design resilient buildings and landscapes. These efforts are aimed at ensuring the safety and resilience of buildings and communities in the face of climate change.
