The Biden Administration has announced a plan to address the increase in COVID-19 cases during the winter. The plan includes expanding access to free COVID-19 testing, encouraging the use of at-home tests before and after traveling or visiting vulnerable individuals. The Administration has made free testing widely available, with over 15,000 community testing sites, coverage of over-the-counter tests under Medicare, and requiring health insurance plans to cover eight free at-home tests per month per individual. The Administration also aims to make vaccinations and treatments readily available to all Americans by working with states, medical providers, and businesses to expand awareness and resources. They will monitor the impacts of variants, cases, and hospitalizations and provide federal support as needed, including clinical personnel, personal protective equipment, and technical assistance. The Administration will focus on protecting the highest-risk Americans, including residents of nursing homes and other congregate care facilities, older individuals, immunocompromised individuals, and others at a higher risk of severe illness.
