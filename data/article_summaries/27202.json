The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has launched the Rural Community Toolbox (RCTB), an online clearinghouse aimed at connecting rural leaders with funding, data, and information to combat drug addiction in rural America. The RCTB provides resources from 16 different federal departments and agencies and serves as a one-stop shop for building strong, healthy, and drug-free rural communities. It offers funding, technical assistance, and information on over 40 key topics related to addiction in rural areas, as well as federal resources for treatment and recovery support. The RCTB also includes an update of the Community Assessment Tool, which provides county-level data on drug overdose deaths and socioeconomic factors. The RCTB is part of the Trump Administration's commitment to supporting rural communities in the fight against addiction.
