In this op-ed, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan discusses the efforts being made to fix struggling schools in the United States. He mentions visiting Miami Central Senior High School, which has received federal funding to support its turnaround efforts. The school has made changes such as promoting a strong school leader, replacing staff, extending learning time, and engaging the community. Despite facing challenges related to poverty, the school's academic performance is steadily improving. Duncan emphasizes that poverty should not determine a student's destiny and highlights the importance of closing achievement gaps in high-poverty communities. The federal government is providing billions of dollars to help turn around the nation's lowest-performing schools, with the redesigned School Improvement Grants program offering up to $6 million per school over a period of three years. Duncan argues that previous approaches to fixing low-performing schools have been unsuccessful and that a more comprehensive and ambitious approach is needed.
