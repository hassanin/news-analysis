In this statement, the President expresses his disappointment over the Republican filibuster of Caitlin Halligan's nomination to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He believes that Halligan is highly qualified and has bipartisan support. The President accuses Senate Republicans of obstructing not just Halligan's nomination, but also 20 other qualified judicial nominees, half of whom were nominated to fill vacancies deemed "judicial emergencies." He urges Senate Republicans to end their pattern of partisan obstructionism and confirm Halligan and the other judges for the sake of a fair and functioning judiciary.
