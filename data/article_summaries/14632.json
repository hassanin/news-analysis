The White House has announced new actions to expand job-driven training and broaden the pathway to the middle class. These actions include engaging employers in partnerships to define needed skills, offer apprenticeships, and hire graduates. There will be competitive grants to launch job-driven industry partnerships, as well as resources to help employers start or expand apprenticeships. The administration has also created a job-driven checklist to ensure that job training programs are effective. Additionally, there will be a focus on providing information to job seekers, states, and communities to make smart choices. This includes tracking employment outcomes for federal programs and making personalized guidance on job search and training available. The administration also plans to pilot promising job-driven training strategies and test innovative education models. They will test strategies for adult learners and disconnected youth through pilot programs and collaborations with employers, foundations, and non-profits.
