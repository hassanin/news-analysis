President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance in Nebraska. The increase applies to Public Assistance projects related to a severe winter storm, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between March 9 and July 14, 2019. Initially, federal funding was set at 75% of eligible costs, but it has now been increased to 90%. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
