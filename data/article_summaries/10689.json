The President of the United States has announced that his administration has filed a complaint against China with the World Trade Organization (WTO). The complaint alleges that China has set prices for wheat, corn, and rice above market levels, resulting in unfair subsidies that violate WTO rules. This has led to overproduction in China and disadvantages American farmers who export these crops. This is the 14th case the US has launched against China since the President took office, and they have won all previous cases. The administration believes that this case will bring an end to China's illegal subsidies and level the playing field for American farmers. The President also emphasized the importance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), stating that it protects American workers, farmers, and businesses by setting high standards and ensuring that other countries play by those standards. He warned that if the US does not set its own high standards through the TPP, China's trade deal in the Asia-Pacific region could harm American jobs and businesses.
