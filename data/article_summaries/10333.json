This article is a notice from the White House concerning the continuation of the national emergency relating to Cuba. The national emergency was declared in 1996 in response to the Cuban government's destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft. The emergency was extended in 2004 to deny support to the Cuban government. The Cuban government has not shown a willingness to refrain from using excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft engaging in memorial activities or peaceful protests near Cuba. Unauthorized entry of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban waters also remains detrimental to U.S. foreign policy. Therefore, the national emergency and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of vessel movement will continue. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
