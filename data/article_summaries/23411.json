President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron have reaffirmed their cooperation on cyberspace issues, particularly cybersecurity. They both share a vision for cyberspace that prioritizes fundamental freedoms, privacy, and the free flow of information. They also believe that the same rules and principles that apply to international peace and security should apply to cyberspace. The United Kingdom has joined the U.S. and other states in the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, a treaty that sets standards for dealing with cybercrime and allows for international cooperation. The leaders will continue working to expand the reach of this treaty. They also recognize the importance of partnering with the technology industry to maintain national competitiveness and spur investment and job growth. They are committed to helping more countries benefit from information and communications technologies and will share strategies and plans to build technological capacity in the developing world. The leaders also emphasize the shared responsibility for cybersecurity and announce new initiatives for joint funding and review of cybersecurity research and development projects.
