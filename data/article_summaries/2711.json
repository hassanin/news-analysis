President Joe Biden participated in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Virtual Leaders' Meeting hosted by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand. The leaders endorsed the Aotearoa Plan of Action, which focuses on an economic agenda that benefits workers, families, and businesses. President Biden emphasized the importance of strengthening the relationship with APEC economies to promote fair and open trade, enhance American competitiveness, and ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. The meeting also discussed efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic and support global economic recovery. President Biden highlighted the United States' commitment to vaccine distribution and pledged to continue sharing doses, investing in manufacturing abroad, and collaborating with APEC economies to improve global health security. He reaffirmed the US's interest in being a reliable partner for APEC economies and discussed ways to unleash the economic power of the region, deepen US economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific, establish common digital technology standards, and address the climate crisis. The meeting builds on President Biden's previous engagements in the Indo-Pacific region, including the July APEC meeting and the October US-ASEAN and East Asia Summits. At the East Asia Summit, he announced the exploration of an Indo-Pacific economic framework to define shared objectives in areas such as trade facilitation, digital economy and technology standards, supply chain resiliency, decarbonization, clean energy, infrastructure, and worker standards.
