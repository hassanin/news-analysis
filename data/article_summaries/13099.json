President Barack Obama proclaimed November 2011 as National Family Caregivers Month. He recognized the millions of family members, neighbors, and friends who provide care and support for their loved ones during times of need. These caregivers exemplify compassion and selflessness and sustain vulnerable individuals in their most vulnerable moments. Many caregivers assist seniors and people with disabilities to improve their quality of life and help them stay in their homes and communities for as long as possible. The administration has focused on supporting family caregivers by investing in respite care, counseling, and training. President Obama also highlighted the importance of providing comprehensive support to veterans, their families, and their caregivers. He signed the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act to extend assistance to family members caring for severely wounded veterans. In honoring family caregivers, President Obama encouraged all Americans to pay tribute to those who care for the health and well-being of their family members, friends, and neighbors.
