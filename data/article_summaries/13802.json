The article discusses the efforts being made by the White House Office of the First Lady to prevent and end veteran homelessness. The Administration has invested in partnerships between the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to achieve this goal. They have provided housing vouchers and homelessness programs to support veterans and their families. The article states that since 2010, there has been a 33% decrease in the total number of homeless veterans nationwide, and a 44% decrease in unsheltered veterans. The First Lady has launched the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness, with 570 mayors, governors, and other local officials committing to ending veteran homelessness in their communities by the end of the year. New Orleans has already achieved this goal, and other cities such as Houston, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City are making progress. The Administration has also invested significant resources, including housing vouchers and supportive services, to help communities in their efforts. The article outlines essential strategies at the community level, such as creating coordinated assessment systems and implementing Housing First practices. The goal is to ensure that no veteran is sleeping on the streets and that communities have systems in place to quickly and efficiently house veterans in need. The Administration is also encouraging communities to conduct counts of homeless individuals to assess the progress being made. These efforts not only aim to end veteran homelessness but also to work towards ending homelessness for all Americans.
