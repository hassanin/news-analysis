First Lady Michelle Obama has announced a five-year commitment by the Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) and the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) to create healthier environments for children who attend out-of-school programming. The commitment aims to provide 5 million children with healthy snacks and physical activity during the critical after-school hours. This initiative will reinforce the work parents are doing at home to keep their kids healthy. The NRPA and BGCA commitments, along with a previous commitment by YMCA of the USA, will impact over 5.5 million children with healthier programming. BGCA will adopt healthy guidelines in 3,400 clubs, reaching an estimated 3.5 million kids, while NRPA will adopt healthy guidelines in 2,000 sites, reaching an estimated 1.5 million kids. The Alliance for a Healthier Generation will provide technical assistance and support to implement the new healthy guidelines.
