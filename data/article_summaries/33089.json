On June 6, 2018, the President signed the VA MISSION Act of 2018 into law. This act includes several provisions to improve healthcare for veterans. Firstly, it creates a new Veterans Community Care Program that consolidates VA's authorities related to providing care through non-VA providers. It also amends certain VA health care authorities and expands the Family Caregivers Program to veterans of all service eras. Additionally, the law establishes an independent commission to oversee VA's asset and infrastructure review process, as well as a Center for Innovation for Care and Payment. Lastly, it addresses miscellaneous issues related to veterans' healthcare.
