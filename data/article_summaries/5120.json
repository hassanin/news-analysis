President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of North Carolina due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred that occurred from August 16 to August 18, 2021. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The counties of Buncombe, Haywood, and Transylvania are eligible for federal funding, which can provide grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid individuals and business owners in recovering from the disaster. Additionally, federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures statewide. John F. Boyle has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and further designations may be made based on additional damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone, and the toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (local time) seven days a week.
