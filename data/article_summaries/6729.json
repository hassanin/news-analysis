The United States, Belize, Germany, Indonesia, and Senegal will co-host the second Global COVID-19 Summit on May 12, 2022. The purpose of the summit is to intensify efforts to end the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future health threats. The summit aims to bring together world leaders, civil society, NGOs, philanthropists, and the private sector to make new commitments and solutions for global vaccination, saving lives, and improving health security. The emergence of new variants like Omicron highlights the need for a global strategy to control COVID-19. The summit will focus on vaccinations, testing, treatments, minimizing disruption to routine health services, and supporting the ACT-Accelerator multilateral mechanism. The goal is to build global capacity to address not only COVID-19 variants but also future health crises. The summit will emphasize supporting locally-led solutions to immediate and long-term challenges.
