The President has designated new national monuments to preserve important chapters of American history, including the Civil War and civil rights movement. These monuments showcase the history of the Reconstruction Era and its impact on freedom, as well as the stories of the civil rights movement in Birmingham and the Freedom Riders. The President has also focused on inclusivity by designating monuments for the LGBT movement and women's equality. In addition, the President is expanding protected areas for natural resources in Oregon and California. These actions aim to preserve and celebrate more of the country's history and protect the outdoors for future generations.
