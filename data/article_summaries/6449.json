The Biden-Harris Administration is urging Congress to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). In a joint letter to congressional leadership, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence emphasized the importance of this intelligence collection authority. Section 702 is vital for U.S. national security and helps protect Americans from threats posed by countries like China and Russia, as well as cyber actors, terrorists, and those targeting critical infrastructure. The reauthorization of Section 702, along with other expiring FISA provisions, is a top priority for the Administration. Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer has been tasked with coordinating the reauthorization effort in collaboration with the Department of Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and other federal partners. The Administration aims to work closely with Congress to preserve this essential tool for protecting the United States.
