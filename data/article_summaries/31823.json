President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation on Memorial Day to honor the brave patriots who have died while serving in the military. He emphasized the importance of remembering and honoring the sacrifices made by these service members, and called upon all Americans to pay their respects. The Department of Veterans Affairs is working to preserve the legacies of fallen heroes, and a new online memorialization platform is being developed to amplify the voices of families and honor their loved ones. The President also called for a day of prayer for permanent peace and designated a moment of remembrance at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. He requested that flags be flown at half-staff until noon and encouraged people to display the flag at half-staff from their homes.
