Today, 130 countries have endorsed a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 percent, which marks an important step in creating a more equitable global economy for workers and middle-class families. This agreement aims to prevent multinational corporations from exploiting tax loopholes and avoiding their fair share of taxes by shifting profits to lower-tax jurisdictions. By implementing a global minimum tax, countries can level the playing field and make their economies more competitive. The additional revenue generated can be used for making crucial investments to maintain a competitive edge in the global economy. The United States, as a leader in this effort, will also need to reform its own corporate tax laws to ensure corporations pay their fair share. The article emphasizes the importance of passing the Made in America tax plan, which includes measures to bring jobs back to the US and make the tax system more beneficial for families, workers, and small businesses. The cooperation and leadership demonstrated in reaching this consensus highlight the potential for progress in improving the lives of people worldwide. The article concludes by recognizing the efforts of Secretary Yellen and expressing optimism for full agreement in the future.
