The proclamation highlights the alarming statistics of impaired driving in the United States, with over 10,000 lives lost in 2018 due to alcohol, drugs, and distracted driving. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of driving sober and taking responsibility for one's actions to prevent tragedies on the road. It also acknowledges the impact of alcohol, drugs, and certain medications on judgment, coordination, and reaction time necessary for safe driving. The administration aims to raise awareness about the dangers of impaired driving, support health professionals and organizations addressing substance use disorder, eliminate unnecessary regulations, and promote the use of innovative technologies to reduce impaired driving. The proclamation calls on all Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired driving.
