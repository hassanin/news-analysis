President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notification to the Congress of the United States stating his intent to terminate the designation of Ethiopia, Guinea, and Mali as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). This decision is based on the non-compliance of these countries with the eligibility requirements of the AGOA. Ethiopia is being terminated for gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, Guinea for not establishing or making progress towards establishing the protection of the rule of law and political pluralism, and Mali for not establishing or making progress towards establishing the protection of the rule of law, political pluralism, internationally recognized worker rights, and for not addressing gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. Despite efforts to engage with these governments, they have failed to address the concerns raised by the United States. The termination of their designation will take effect on January 1, 2022, but the progress of these countries towards meeting the AGOA eligibility requirements will continue to be assessed.
