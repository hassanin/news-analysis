Florida's Republican-controlled legislature has passed a controversial abortion ban that is now awaiting Governor DeSantis's signature. The ban, which goes against the majority opinion of Floridians and Americans, would prohibit abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even realize they are pregnant. This ban would affect around four million women of reproductive age in Florida and an additional 15 million women in neighboring states that have also banned abortion. Despite widespread opposition and recent election results supporting reproductive rights, Republican officials are persisting in their efforts to restrict access to abortion. President Biden and his administration are standing with women and healthcare providers in the fight to protect access to abortion and defend reproductive rights.
