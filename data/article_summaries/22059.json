President Obama announced that the United States and China have reached an agreement to expand the scope of goods covered by the Information Technology Agreement (ITA). This agreement will lead to the first major tariff-cutting deal at the World Trade Organization in 17 years. It is expected to boost U.S. technology exports and create jobs. The expansion of the ITA will eliminate barriers to high-tech trade and reduce tariffs on more than 200 tariff lines, including medical equipment, GPS devices, video game consoles, and computer software. It is estimated that this agreement will support up to 60,000 additional U.S. jobs, eliminate tariffs on roughly $1 trillion in annual global sales of information and communications technology products, and increase annual global GDP by $190 billion. The U.S.-China breakthrough is seen as a critical step towards completing the ITA expansion. The agreement will also benefit U.S. manufacturing and technology industries by eliminating tariffs on products such as next-generation semiconductors, MRI machines, GPS devices, and video game consoles.
