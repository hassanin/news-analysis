President Biden has implemented an extensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a successful vaccination program that has fully vaccinated 220 million Americans and boosted over 100 million people. One effective treatment is the oral antiviral pill called Paxlovid, which reduces the risk of hospitalization or death by about 90 percent. The Biden Administration has worked to ensure that these treatments are widely available and that healthcare providers and patients are aware of their effectiveness. Efforts include the establishment of over 2,500 Test-to-Treat locations across the country at local pharmacies and community health centers. The administration's actions have led to a significant increase in the number of people benefiting from oral antivirals, with prescriptions filled increasing from about 27,000 per week to over 182,000 last week. COVID-19 deaths have decreased by 90 percent due to the administration's work on vaccines, boosters, and treatments. The goal is to make these lifesaving tools accessible to every American in need. The launch of the first federally-supported Test-to-Treat site is being announced, with more sites planned in the future.
