The Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to strengthen the Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISI) program, which has empowered underserved Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander students. President Biden issued a proclamation celebrating the impact of the AANAPISI program and designated September 25 through October 1, 2023, as National AANAPISI Week. AANAPISIs enroll nearly half of the nation's Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander undergraduate students and confer a significant percentage of associate and baccalaureate degrees for these communities. However, the AANAPISI designation is not well-known compared to other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), and many eligible institutions are unaware of the program. The "model minority" myth, limited funding, lack of disaggregated data, and barriers such as discrimination and violence contribute to the challenges faced by AANAPISIs. The Biden-Harris Administration is investing in MSIs, including AANAPISIs, through funding, grants, and support for students. They are also working to advance equity, justice, and opportunity for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities in higher education. The administration aims to strengthen and support AANAPISIs to unlock the potential of students and create a more inclusive and equitable education system.
