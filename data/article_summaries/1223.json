Bob Moses, a prominent civil rights activist, dedicated his life to fighting for equality and empowering Black voters. Despite facing violence and brutality, he remained calm and humble. The backlash against the Freedom Summer he organized ultimately led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Education was a key focus for Moses, as he believed it was a powerful tool for equality. He consistently showed up and never gave up, both in Mississippi's polling stations and classrooms across the nation. In his memory, we should continue his work and strive to create a society that upholds the promise of our nation. In light of current threats to voting rights, the author calls on Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. By forming a diverse coalition, we can address the urgency of the moment and honor Moses' legacy by ensuring that every American is treated with dignity and respect. The author extends their condolences to Moses' family.
