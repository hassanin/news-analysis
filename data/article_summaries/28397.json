President Trump and the Republican Congress are prioritizing tax reform, which they believe will benefit the American people by promoting job creation, economic growth, and providing relief for low and middle-income families. The President aims to lead the most significant tax reform legislation since 1986, including one of the largest tax cuts in American history. The current tax code is complex and burdensome, with taxpayers spending billions of hours complying with it each year. The plan is to simplify the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets from seven to three and doubling the standard deduction. This would create a 0% tax rate for the first $24,000 of income for married couples. Tax relief for child and dependent care expenses is also included. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) would be repealed to eliminate complications for taxpayers. The top tax rate on capital gains and dividends would be reduced to 20% by repealing the 3.8% Obamacare tax. The death tax, which imposes a tax on inheritances, would be repealed to prevent small business owners and farmers from having to engage in complicated estate planning. Most tax breaks that primarily benefit high-income individuals would be eliminated, while protecting home ownership, charitable giving, and retirement savings. The goal is to make the economy work better for the American people.
