The Biden Cancer Moonshot has launched a new project called "Curing the Uncurable via RNA-Encoded Immunogene Tuning" (CUREIT), which aims to use mRNA technology to train the immune system to effectively fight cancer and other diseases. The project will be led by a team at Emory University in Atlanta and will receive up to $24 million in funding from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H). The goal of CUREIT is to develop mRNA platforms that can stimulate immune responses to target and attack tumors, as well as potentially treat autoimmune disorders, transplants, and infectious diseases. This project is part of ARPA-H's mission to drive breakthroughs in preventing, detecting, and treating cancer and other diseases. ARPA-H has also recently launched programs targeting precision surgical interventions for cancer and tissue regeneration in osteoarthritis. The CUREIT project is the first award from ARPA-H's Open Broad Agency Announcement, with future projects to be funded on a rolling basis.
