President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring November 2016 as National College Application Month. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of expanding access to affordable higher education in order to provide equal opportunities for all Americans. The administration has taken several steps to make college more affordable, including increasing investments in grant and scholarship aid, keeping interest rates low on federal student loans, and implementing programs to help borrowers manage debt. The proclamation also highlights initiatives such as the College Scorecard, which provides information on college cost, graduation rates, debt, and post-college earnings, and the Reach Higher initiative, which encourages more students to pursue a higher education. The administration has also worked to reduce barriers to educational opportunity, including providing individuals with criminal records a fair chance to seek a higher education. The proclamation calls on public officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe National College Application Month with activities and programs designed to encourage students to make plans for and apply to college.
