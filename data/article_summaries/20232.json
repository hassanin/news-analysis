This article discusses the progress made in the fight against HIV/AIDS during President Obama's administration. It highlights key milestones, such as the development of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, lifting the entry ban for tourists and immigrants living with HIV, and the approval of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The article also mentions the latest available data, which shows improvements in indicators such as new HIV diagnoses and viral suppression, but also identifies areas where progress has stalled, such as reducing disparities in the Southern United States and decreasing homelessness among people with HIV. The article further discusses the actions taken to improve HIV prevention, care, and research, including the launch of an HIV vaccine efficacy study in South Africa and the establishment of a new framework for PrEP delivery. Finally, the article emphasizes the leadership of the United States in addressing the global HIV/AIDS crisis through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR has invested over $70 billion to accelerate impact and control the epidemic, supporting millions of people with life-saving treatment and prevention interventions. The article concludes by highlighting PEPFAR's achievements, such as supporting nearly 11.5 million individuals with antiretroviral treatment, preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and reaching adolescent girls and young women with comprehensive prevention interventions through the DREAMS partnership.
