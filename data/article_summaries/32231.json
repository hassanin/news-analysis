During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders discussed various topics including President Trump's recent trip to Asia, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and the allegations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. Sanders stated that the President believes the allegations against Moore are troubling and should be taken seriously, but that it is ultimately up to the people of Alabama to decide whether or not to support him. She also addressed questions about the President's endorsement of Moore, his views on the accusations, and whether he would campaign with Moore. Sanders discussed the tax bill passed by the House, stating that it fulfills the President's promise to deliver tax cuts for the American people and stimulate economic growth. She also addressed questions about the economy, trade with China, North Korea, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the lifting of the ban on elephant trophies. Sanders declined to comment on ongoing investigations and referred questions to the appropriate departments.
