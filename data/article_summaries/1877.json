President Biden will reconvene the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF) on September 17 to address the global climate crisis. This virtual meeting builds upon the Leaders Summit on Climate held in April and precedes the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow. The President aims to galvanize efforts to confront climate change, having already returned the United States to the Paris Agreement and committed to reducing US emissions by 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Other countries have also pledged steps in line with the 1.5-degree Celsius warming limit. The urgency of the situation has been underscored by recent findings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an increase in climate-related disasters worldwide. During the MEF meeting, President Biden will stress the importance of stronger climate action, highlighting both the urgency and the economic benefits. He will call on leaders to increase their climate ambition leading up to COP 26 and beyond. Additionally, the President will outline plans to use the MEF as a platform for collective efforts to scale up climate action in the coming decade.
