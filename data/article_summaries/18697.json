The White House has announced the talent line-up and program for the 2015 White House Easter Egg Roll, which is celebrating its 137th year. The event, taking place on April 6th, will feature sports and fitness zones, cooking demonstrations, live music, storytelling, and traditional activities such as the egg roll and egg hunt. The theme for this year's event is "#GimmeFive," in line with the First Lady's Let's Move! initiative, challenging Americans to share five things they are doing to eat better, be more active, and lead a healthier life. The talent line-up includes various performers such as DJ Fussyman, Diggy Simmons, Fifth Harmony, MKTO, Sesame Street, and "So You Think You Can Dance" All-Stars. There will also be appearances by notable figures like Misty Copeland, Connie Britton, and Genevieve Goings. In addition, the event will feature activities and interactive centers focusing on healthy eating, physical activity, and scientific exploration. The Easter Egg Roll is the largest annual public event at the White House and has been a long-standing tradition.
