The White House has issued a notice on the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans. The emergency was first declared in 2001 due to the threat posed by extremist violence and obstructionist activity in the region. The President has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, citing the ongoing threat to national security and foreign policy. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
