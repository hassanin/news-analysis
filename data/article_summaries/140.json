The Department of Commerce has announced funding for high-speed internet infrastructure deployment in each state, territory, and the District of Columbia through the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. This $42.45 billion grant program, created in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aims to connect every American to reliable and affordable high-speed internet by the end of the decade. This funding will not only bridge the digital divide but also support manufacturing jobs and attract private sector investment by using materials made in America. The announcement of BEAD funds is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to ensure internet access for all, which includes over $700 million in USDA ReConnect awards, over $900 million in NTIA Middle Mile awards, and the launch of the Online for All campaign. The Biden-Harris Administration has already announced or distributed billions of dollars to all states and territories for high-speed internet infrastructure development.
