The White House has announced the expansion of the Opportunity Project, an initiative aimed at increasing access to opportunity in communities across the US. The project involves the development of digital tools that use federal and local data to provide information on resources such as affordable housing, quality schools, and jobs. The project has resulted in the creation of 29 new digital tools that help meet needs in communities, including finding affordable housing near jobs, increasing transit accessibility in low-income communities, and advocating for broader access to opportunity. The Department of Commerce will lead the Opportunity Project and create a platform for collaboration between technologists, government, and local communities. Other commitments include the release of new open APIs for data on civil rights and course access, the extension of open climate information, and the development of courses that use Opportunity Project data. The project also calls for members of the public to develop new tools and offer additional sources of data to make communities more prosperous, equitable, and just.
