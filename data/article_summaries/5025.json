The White House COVID-19 Team has announced its strategy to manage the BA.5 subvariant of the Omicron variant. The strategy focuses on ensuring easy and convenient access to vaccines, treatments, tests, and other tools that protect against and treat COVID-19. BA.4 and BA.5 now make up 80 percent of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., with BA.5 accounting for the majority of cases. BA.5 may have increased ability to escape immunity, potentially leading to a rise in infections. To combat this, the strategy includes efforts to increase booster shot uptake, promote access to COVID-19 treatments, make testing widely available, provide free high-quality masks, prioritize protections for immunocompromised individuals, encourage improved indoor ventilation, and empower people with information through the COVID.gov website and hotline. The strategy emphasizes the importance of vaccines, treatments, and other tools in preventing serious illness, hospitalizations, and deaths. The administration aims to mobilize the federal government, work with state and local leaders, healthcare workers, the private sector, and community organizations to implement these measures.
