The White House, in partnership with the U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, is hosting an event to promote active STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) learning for young children. Over 200 submissions of innovative STEM work were received from leaders across the country, and these commitments have the potential to bring new active STEM content to millions of households. The Obama Administration is taking new steps to support early active STEM learning, including funding research grants to improve early elementary science outcomes, creating a suite of STEM tip sheets and resources for families and early educators, releasing a policy statement on the role of technology in early learning, and sharing new research on the Ready to Learn Program. Private sector groups are also committing to actions to increase access to high-quality early STEM education, such as launching initiatives, promoting programming, and providing resources and training. The full list of commitments can be found in the attached document.
