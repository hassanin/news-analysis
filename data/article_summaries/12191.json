President Obama has declared a major disaster in Kentucky and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding occurred from February 29 to March 3, 2012. The funding will be available to individuals in specific counties for temporary housing, home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. Hazard mitigation measures will also be funded on a cost-sharing basis for the entire state. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will coordinate federal recovery operations, and additional assistance may be designated after further assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the affected counties can apply for assistance online or through a toll-free telephone number.
