Specialist Salvatore Giunta will be awarded the Medal of Honor for his acts of bravery during combat operations in Afghanistan in 2007. He will be the first living service member to receive this honor for service in Iraq or Afghanistan. President Obama spoke with Giunta to inform him of the award and thanked him for his service and extraordinary bravery. Giunta distinguished himself by exposing himself to enemy fire to save a comrade and engaging the enemy to rescue a fellow soldier. His courage and leadership were crucial in defeating an enemy ambush and recovering a fellow American paratrooper. Further details about the ceremony will be announced later.
