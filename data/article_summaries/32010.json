The article discusses how a single district judge has suspended the application of federal law nationwide, which removes certain classes of illegal aliens from legal accountability. In 1996, Congress passed a law allowing for the expedited removal of illegal aliens within two years of their arrival in the country. Previous administrations limited the application of this law, but the Trump Administration has used it extensively to address the immigration crisis at the southern border. However, a single judge is now preventing the government from enforcing the law as written. The article also mentions that for the past two and a half years, the Trump Administration has been trying to restore enforcement of immigration laws, but lower court decisions have hindered their efforts, resulting in significant costs for the country.
