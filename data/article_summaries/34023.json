The Vice President, Mike Pence, spoke at the first-ever Prison Reform Summit at the White House. He emphasized that prison reform is a national priority for the Trump administration and highlighted the need to give current prisoners the training and skills they need to reintegrate into society successfully. Pence praised the efforts of Jared Kushner, who has brought together people from across the political spectrum to work on prison reform. He also mentioned that the President has already taken action on this issue, including signing an executive order to establish the Federal Interagency Council on Crime Prevention and Improving Reentry. Pence stressed the importance of evidence-based programs that address mental health, drug addiction, job training, and mentorship. He cited the statistics that show two-thirds of former inmates are arrested again within three years and that over half will be convicted, with 40% returning to prison. Pence concluded by saying that prison reform is about changing lives and communities, and that it is a matter of public safety, fiscal responsibility, and giving people a second chance.
