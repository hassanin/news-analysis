President Obama will be traveling to North Carolina, Colorado, and Iowa to urge Congress to prevent interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Over 7.4 million students with federal student loans would be affected if Congress does not take action. The President believes that keeping interest rates low is important in order to provide more Americans with affordable college education and better job opportunities. President Obama will visit universities in each state to discuss the issue with students. The White House will also use social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ to promote the campaign with the hashtag #DontDoubleMyRate. The President's efforts to address student loan interest rates will continue until Congress passes legislation to keep rates low and ensure access to college education. More details about the trip will be released later.
