The Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip has been a site of conflict for years. Recently, Israeli authorities foiled an attempt to smuggle explosives into Gaza, believed to be intended for long-range projectiles to be fired into Israel. The Gaza Strip is facing economic disorder, and while the people suffer, Hamas, the fundamentalist terror group in control, wastes resources on its campaign against Israel instead of improving the lives of its people. Hamas has been treating the people of Gaza as shields and hostages, using them as bargaining chips. The money that could be used to help the people of Gaza is instead going to Hamas for its terrorist activities. Iran has historically given Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups $100 million annually, but Gaza's living conditions continue to deteriorate. Iran is complicit in this disaster as their financing has not improved living conditions or grown the economy. Hamas relies on the Palestinian Authority for a few hours of power per day and cannot keep the lights on. President Trump has expressed support for the people of Iran in their struggle for freedom and has emphasized the need to exert pressure on Tehran. The article concludes that only when terrorism is replaced with respect for human life and dignity can Gaza begin to rebuild and grow its economy.
