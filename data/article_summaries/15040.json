The White House Office of the Vice President released a fact sheet on the Central American Citizen Security Partnership. The partnership aims to improve citizen security in Central America by creating a coalition of governments, citizens, civil society, and the private sector. The United States is supporting the partnership through various investments, including reducing the demand for illegal drugs through education, treatment, and prevention, law enforcement efforts targeting transnational criminal organizations and gangs, support through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), cooperation with Central American counterparts, Operation Martillo to disrupt trafficking along the Central American coast, and participation in the Group of Friends of Central America, which has generated over $650 million in commitments to support the implementation of the Central American Security Strategy. The fact sheet also provides additional background on U.S. efforts, such as reducing domestic illegal drug consumption, domestic law enforcement against transnational crime and gangs, direct support for partners through CARSI, cooperation between U.S. federal law enforcement and partner country law enforcement, joint and combined operations, and the Group of Friends of Central America.
