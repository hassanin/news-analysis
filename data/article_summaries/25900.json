According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy added 266,000 jobs in November, bringing the total increase to 41,000 additional jobs when including revisions to September and October's numbers. The return of striking GM workers also contributed to the increase in jobs. On average, job growth has been 211,000 per month over the past two months. This exceeds market expectations by 44% and brings the average monthly job creation for 2019 to 180,000. Since President Trump's election, the economy has added more than 7 million jobs, surpassing the Congressional Budget Office's projections. The economy has created at least 100,000 jobs in 33 out of the 36 months since Trump was elected, demonstrating the strength of the labor market. The Trump Administration's pro-growth policies have led to high labor demand, increased employment, and growing wages. Nominal average hourly earnings have increased at a 3.1% rate year-over-year, marking the 16th consecutive month of wage growth above 3%. Real wages are also growing, with inflation-adjusted wages increasing by 1.9% year-over-year. November's unemployment rate returned to the 50-year low achieved under the Trump Administration, and unemployment rates for various demographics have reached series-low levels. The number of people experiencing unemployment has declined, and the labor force participation rate has increased since Trump took office. These positive trends in the labor market demonstrate the impact of pro-growth policies on working Americans across demographics and income distribution.
