The article discusses the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the actions of the government of Syria. On May 11, 2004, the President issued Executive Order 13338, declaring a national emergency due to the actions of the Syrian government. This order allowed for the blocking of property and prohibited certain goods from being exported or re-exported to Syria. Additional steps were taken in 2006 and 2008 through Executive Orders 13399 and 13460. These actions were taken to address the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by Syria's support for terrorism, occupation of Lebanon, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining of U.S. and international efforts in Iraq. Due to the continuing threat, the national emergency declared in 2004 and the measures taken must continue beyond May 11, 2009.
