In this article, President Barack Obama issues a presidential memorandum delegating authority to the Secretary of State under Section 614 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The memorandum grants the Secretary of State the power to determine whether it is in the security interests of the United States to provide up to $123 million in funds for assistance to Ukraine, Tunisia, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, Nigeria, Albania, and Vietnam. This authority allows the Secretary of State to provide assistance without being restricted by any provision of law within the scope of Section 614(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act. The memorandum also directs the Secretary of State to publish it in the Federal Register.
