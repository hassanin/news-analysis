President Biden, along with Prime Minister Albanese of Australia and Prime Minister Sunak of the UK, announced the next steps in advancing the Australia, US, UK partnership known as AUKUS. The partnership aims to enhance stability in the Indo-Pacific region and strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The first project under AUKUS involves developing Australia's conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarine capacity. It was emphasized that these submarines will be nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed, and Australia will continue to adhere to its non-nuclear weapons status. The partnership will also create job opportunities and strengthen industrial bases in each country. The leaders expressed their commitment to defending shared values and securing a peaceful and prosperous future.
