White House officials, including Gene Sperling and Erika Poethig, recently held virtual listening sessions with landlords and tenant advocates to discuss the distribution of emergency rental assistance funds and ways to protect renters from eviction. The officials emphasized the importance of landlords accepting rental assistance before pursuing evictions and received feedback on state and local rental assistance programs. They also discussed strategies to expedite the release of rental assistance funds and promote eviction diversion. The Biden Administration remains committed to ensuring that emergency rental assistance reaches those in need, and these meetings are part of ongoing efforts to raise awareness and accelerate distribution of available funds.
