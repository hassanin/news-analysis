The Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 is aimed at creating jobs, strengthening the recovery, and helping workers who cannot find jobs. It provides tax cuts for homebuyers and businesses, as well as support for struggling workers. The legislation allows for up to 20 additional weeks of unemployment insurance, benefiting over a million workers. It also cuts taxes for struggling businesses, providing them with immediate cash to expand or avoid layoffs. The act extends and expands the Homebuyer Credit, with measures to combat tax fraud. The legislation is paid for by postponing tax provisions benefiting U.S. multinational corporations. These steps build on the successes of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which included investments in unemployment benefits, tax cuts for businesses, and the first-time homebuyer credit.
