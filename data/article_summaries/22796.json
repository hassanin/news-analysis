The United States welcomes the preliminary agreement between the Government of Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a loan program of $14-18 billion. This agreement is expected to unlock roughly $27 billion in total support from the international community for Ukraine's people over the next two years. The IMF program will be a central component of a package of assistance to support Ukraine as it implements reforms and conducts free and fair elections. The United States is working with international partners to provide additional assistance and is also working with Congress to provide a $1 billion loan guarantee and technical and financial assistance to Ukraine. The United States remains committed to providing the IMF with the resources it needs to support countries like Ukraine.
