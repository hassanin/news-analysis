President Biden addressed the nation to provide an update on the COVID-19 pandemic. He emphasized that while COVID-19 cases are ticking up, America now has the tools to protect its citizens. The President announced the launch of COVID.gov, a one-stop shop where Americans can access free vaccines, boosters, at-home tests, and high-quality masks. He also highlighted the availability of test-to-treat locations across the country and the importance of congressional funding to continue the fight against COVID-19. Without sufficient funding, there may be a shortage of monoclonal antibodies, preventive therapies, and testing capacity. The President urged Congress to act immediately to secure additional supply and ensure that shots are available for all Americans. He also emphasized the need for funding to continue global vaccination efforts. President Biden received his second booster shot during the address and addressed questions from reporters on various topics, including Ukraine and vaccine access for children.
