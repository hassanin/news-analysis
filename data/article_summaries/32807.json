The President has announced the appointment of the 1776 Commission, a group of Americans who will work to ensure that children are taught to love and appreciate their country's history. The Commission aims to counteract the teaching of hatred towards America's founding and history in schools. They will focus on sharing the inspiring and unifying aspects of America's history, emphasizing the principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence, and explaining how these principles have helped the nation overcome challenges in the past and can guide it towards a great future. The President urges all Americans to pay attention to the work of the Commission.
