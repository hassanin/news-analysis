President Barack Obama has issued a memorandum directing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish an emergency leave transfer program for federal employees affected by the severe storms and tornadoes in Oklahoma. This program will allow employees in the executive and judicial branches, as well as those in agency leave banks, to donate unused annual leave to fellow employees who were adversely affected and need additional time off for recovery. The President has also instructed the OPM to provide guidance on the program's administration to agencies.
