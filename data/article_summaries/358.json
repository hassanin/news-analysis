Today marks 100 years of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Baltic Allies - Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Throughout the years, the US has consistently supported the legitimate governments of these countries. In 1940, when the Baltic nations were occupied by Soviet Troops, the US issued the Welles Declaration, affirming its belief in sovereignty, self-determination, and territorial integrity, and opposing threats or force. Over 60 years later, the Baltic states became NATO Allies, further solidifying the US commitment to their freedom and sovereignty. As Europe faces renewed challenges to its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the US stands with its Allies to defend freedom, democracy, and security. The US is united with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to counter Russia's aggression towards Ukraine and to hold Russia accountable. The US will continue to work closely with its Baltic Allies on global challenges to ensure a future of peace, security, and freedom for all.
