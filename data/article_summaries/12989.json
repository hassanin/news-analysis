The United States and China have issued a joint statement on climate change, reaffirming their commitment to a successful and ambitious global climate agreement to be concluded in Paris in December. The statement includes a common vision for the agreement, with a focus on ramping up ambition over time and transitioning to a low-carbon global economy. Both countries have also made significant domestic policy commitments, such as the U.S. Clean Power Plan to reduce emissions in the power sector by 32% by 2030 and China's plans to launch a national emission trading system and implement a "green dispatch" system to favor low-carbon sources in the electric grid. The two countries are also stepping up their efforts to phase down super-polluting hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). In terms of climate finance, China has committed $3.1 billion to help developing countries combat climate change, and both countries emphasize the importance of continued financial support beyond 2020. The statement also highlights the importance of bilateral cooperation and collaboration between sub-national governments in tackling climate change.
