One year ago, President Biden unveiled his Build Back Better Agenda, which aims to address various challenges facing the country, including the pandemic, economic downturn, climate crisis, and racial injustices. The agenda includes the American Families Plan and elements of the American Jobs Plan. The plan aims to create jobs, cut taxes, and lower costs for working families. It proposes measures such as allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices to lower prescription drug costs, making universal preschool a reality, extending the cost savings of the Affordable Care Act, providing free community college and increasing Pell Grant awards, investing in affordable housing, and cutting taxes for families with children and workers without children. The agenda also focuses on workforce training, clean energy jobs, and investments in teachers and schools to improve educational equity.
