House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady have issued a joint statement on tax reform. They believe that fixing the tax code is the most important action to grow the economy and help the middle class. They have been meeting regularly to develop a shared template for tax reform and are confident that a shared vision exists. The two tax-writing committees will now work on developing and drafting legislation for comprehensive tax reform, with the goal of reducing tax rates, allowing capital expensing, and creating a system that encourages American companies to bring back jobs and profits. They have decided to set aside the border adjustability policy in order to advance tax reform. They expect the legislation to move through the committees this fall and be considered on the House and Senate floors. The President supports these principles and is committed to this approach.
