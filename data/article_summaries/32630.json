The Trump administration is launching the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative (W-GDP) to empower women in developing countries. The initiative aims to help 50 million women realize their economic potential by 2025, which could boost global economic output by an additional $12 trillion. W-GDP establishes a new fund at the U.S. Agency for International Development with an initial allocation of $50 million. The initiative focuses on three pillars: advancing workforce development and vocational education, empowering women as entrepreneurs, and eliminating barriers preventing women from participating in their local economies. The goal is to create a future where women can achieve their full potential and contribute to greater freedom, peace, and prosperity worldwide.
