Nine families of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting have reached a landmark settlement with gun manufacturer Remington. Although the settlement cannot undo the pain of the tragic event, it represents a step towards holding gun manufacturers accountable for producing weapons of war and promoting them irresponsibly. This achievement is the result of the determination of the nine families, who have shown that state consumer protection laws can be used to hold gun manufacturers and dealers responsible for their actions, despite the federal immunity shield that protects these companies. The article calls on Congress to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act to fully hold gun manufacturers and dealers accountable. In the meantime, the author encourages state and local lawmakers, lawyers, and survivors of gun violence to replicate the success of the Sandy Hook families in seeking justice. The goal is to send a clear message to gun manufacturers and dealers that they must either change their practices to help combat the gun violence epidemic or face financial consequences for their involvement.
