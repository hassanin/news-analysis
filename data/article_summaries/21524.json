In this op-ed, Vice President Biden discusses the importance of green jobs in aiding the middle class. He explains that green jobs involve providing products and services that utilize renewable energy resources, reduce pollution, and conserve energy and natural resources. Biden emphasizes that investing in green jobs not only helps the environment but also keeps up with the modern economy. Green jobs tend to pay higher wages and are more likely to be union jobs. Examples of green jobs include building a new power grid, manufacturing solar panels, weatherizing homes and office buildings, and renovating schools. Biden mentions that investing in green jobs can also lead to cost savings for consumers, such as lower electric and heating bills. He highlights Philadelphia as an example of a city that is actively working towards building a greener economy, with initiatives to impart green skills to workers and support large-scale green investments. Biden concludes by stating that creating green jobs benefits both the economy and the environment.
