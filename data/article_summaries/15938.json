In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims May 1, 2013, as Law Day in the United States. He emphasizes the idea that what unites Americans is their allegiance to the belief that all men are created equal and endowed with certain unalienable rights. Obama reflects on the journey towards equality and the efforts made to bridge the gap between the principles of freedom and fairness and the realities of the time. He mentions significant milestones such as the Emancipation Proclamation, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, Title IX, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, he acknowledges that there is still work to be done as opportunities and justice remain unequal for many. Obama encourages Americans to celebrate Law Day by honoring the role of courts in addressing these issues and upholding the right to due process. He calls for appropriate ceremonies and activities to acknowledge the importance of the nation's legal and judicial systems and urges the display of the United States flag in support of this observance.
