In a press conference held in the Oval Office, President Trump addressed the issue of vaping and its impact on children. He expressed concern about the increasing number of children using e-cigarettes and the potential health risks associated with vaping. The President announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be finalizing a guidance document that would require the removal of all flavored e-cigarettes, except tobacco flavor, from the market. The FDA will also require manufacturers of tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes to file for pre-market tobacco approval. The President emphasized the need to protect children from the harmful effects of vaping and stated that strong rules and regulations will be implemented to address the issue. The President also discussed other topics such as the resignation of John Bolton, ongoing trade negotiations with China, and the situation in Iran and North Korea.
