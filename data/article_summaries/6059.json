In this statement, Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledges the verdict in the trial of the police officer involved in the death of George Floyd and expresses gratitude to the jury and Floyd's family. She acknowledges that while the verdict brings relief, it does not erase the pain and emphasizes that a measure of justice is not the same as equal justice. Harris mentions the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a bill she introduced with Senator Cory Booker and Representative Karen Bass, which aims to hold law enforcement accountable and build trust between communities and law enforcement. She urges the Senate to pass this legislation as a start to reforming the system. Harris also highlights the long history of systemic racism in America, particularly against Black men, and emphasizes the need to value their lives in all aspects of society. She states that racial injustice is not just a problem for Black Americans or people of color, but for every American, as it hinders the fulfillment of liberty and justice for all. Harris concludes by emphasizing that we are all part of George Floyd's legacy and that it is our responsibility to honor him and his memory.
