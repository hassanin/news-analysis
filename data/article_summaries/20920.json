President Obama has directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to create the first-ever National Policy to increase fuel efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas pollution from medium- and heavy-duty trucks for Model Years 2014-2018. Currently, trucks consume more than two million barrels of oil every day and emit 20% of greenhouse gas pollution related to transportation. The President also called for an extension of the National Program for cars and light-duty trucks to Model Year 2017 and beyond. Additionally, the Department of Energy will provide increased support for the deployment of advanced vehicles, including electric vehicles, and the EPA will reduce non-greenhouse-gas pollutants from motor vehicles. This announcement aims to reduce dependence on oil, enhance American competitiveness and job creation, and protect the environment by reducing greenhouse gas and other pollutants. The EPA and DOT will develop forthcoming rulemaking proposals to achieve these goals.
