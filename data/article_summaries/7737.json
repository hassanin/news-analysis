President Biden is signing an executive order reestablishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, which will promote partnerships with religious and secular organizations to better serve people in need. The office's initial work will include collaborating with civil society to address the COVID-19 pandemic, combat systemic racism, increase opportunity for disadvantaged communities, and strengthen pluralism. Melissa Rogers will serve as the office's Executive Director and Josh Dickson as Deputy Director. The office will also work with agency Centers for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships to execute its objectives. The Biden-Harris administration aims to bring people of all backgrounds and beliefs together to meet challenges and restore the soul of the country.
