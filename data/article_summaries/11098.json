President Obama issued a statement expressing sadness over the passing of Jefferson Thomas, one of the "Little Rock Nine" who helped to desegregate Little Rock Central High School. Thomas, a teenager at the time, bravely walked into the school despite facing opposition from the governor and a mob. His actions, along with his fellow members of the Little Rock Nine, helped to open doors of opportunity for future generations. President Obama acknowledged the progress made in civil rights and praised Thomas for his leadership and courage. The statement concluded with thoughts and prayers for Thomas' family.
