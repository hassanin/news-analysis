The White House recently held a listening session to discuss the use of automated technologies by employers to monitor and manage their workers. Workers from various sectors shared their experiences and raised concerns about health, safety, privacy, fair pay, labor organizing, and reasonable accommodations for disabilities. The session was attended by officials from the White House, as well as several government agencies. This session followed a Request for Information released by the Biden-Harris Administration to gather information on the impact of automated technologies on workers. The stories shared by workers included instances of employers using automated technology to set productivity quotas, electronic verification systems that don't accurately track working hours, and apps that continuously track drivers' data without transparency on how it affects their pay. Automated surveillance technologies were also mentioned, with concerns about their reliability and impact on disciplinary actions.
