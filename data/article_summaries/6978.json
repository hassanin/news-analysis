The Biden-Harris Administration has released new data revealing the number of individuals in each state who applied for student debt relief or were automatically eligible for relief. However, lawsuits filed by elected officials and special interests have prevented these borrowers from benefiting from the relief program. The Administration's plan, announced in August, aimed to provide up to $20,000 in debt relief for borrowers earning less than $125,000 per year. Within four weeks, 26 million people either applied for debt relief or were deemed eligible by the Department of Education. Of these, over 16 million borrowers' applications were fully approved and sent to loan servicers. However, lawsuits filed by opponents of the program forced the Department to stop accepting applications in November, preventing any debt from being discharged. The Biden Administration's debt relief program would benefit over 40 million borrowers, with nearly 90% of the relief going to those earning less than $75,000 per year. The lawsuits brought on by elected officials have delayed the implementation of the relief program, denying millions of borrowers the benefits they are entitled to.
