The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced the Fiscal Year 2020 Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program's Notice of Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). This program aims to provide financial assistance to community coalitions focused on preventing youth substance use. In FY 2020, 200 new communities will receive $25 million in direct funding from the White House to combat illicit drug use and save lives. The ONDCP Director, Jim Carroll, emphasized the importance of educating youth about the dangers of substance use and highlighted the effectiveness of the Drug-Free Communities program in reducing youth substance use rates. The day-to-day management of the DFC and Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act Local Drug Crisis programs will transition to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. The CDC Director, Robert R. Redfield, expressed excitement about partnering with the ONDCP and supporting community coalitions in preventing substance use among youth. The DFC Program is a $101 million grant program aimed at establishing and strengthening collaboration to prevent youth substance use, while the CARA grants, funded at $4 million, focus on preventing and reducing the abuse of opioids, methamphetamines, and prescription medications among youth. Community coalitions interested in applying to the DFC Program can find more information on the ONDCP website.
