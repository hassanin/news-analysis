On June 6, 1944, Allied forces fought in the D-Day battle to secure freedom during World War II. They faced challenges such as fortified Nazi defenses, mines, and barbed wire. Despite heavy losses, they achieved victory and opened a path to liberating Europe. The D-Day victory led to important post-war achievements like the Marshall Plan and NATO. To honor the service members who fought and died, President Barack Obama proclaimed June 6, 2014, as D-Day National Remembrance Day. He called upon all Americans to observe the day with programs and activities that honor the sacrifices made for freedom.
