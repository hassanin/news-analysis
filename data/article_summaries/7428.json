The article discusses the establishment of a Domestic Policy Council (DPC) system by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The DPC is intended to assist the President in addressing domestic policy issues and coordinating efforts among various executive departments and agencies. The DPC will be led by the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and will consist of four tiers of interagency bodies: the DPC, the Principals Committee (PC), the Deputies Committee (DC), and the Interagency Policy Committees (IPCs). These bodies will work together to develop and implement domestic policy initiatives, analyze policy options, and ensure coordination among agencies. The DPC will focus on a wide range of issues, including healthcare, racial and gender equity, criminal justice reform, immigration, education, and climate policy. It will also collaborate with other White House offices and officials, such as the National Economic Council and the National Security Council, to ensure integrated policymaking processes. The article concludes by listing the members of the DPC and other relevant officials who will be involved in the domestic policy process.
