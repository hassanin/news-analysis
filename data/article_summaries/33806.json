President Donald Trump has proclaimed September 17 to September 23, 2017, as National Farm Safety and Health Week in the United States. The proclamation recognizes the hard work and contributions of American farmers, ranchers, and foresters, and emphasizes the need to ensure their health and safety. It highlights the physically demanding and potentially dangerous tasks that these individuals perform, often in high-risk settings, and emphasizes the need for comprehensive farm-safety education and training initiatives. The proclamation also calls upon the people of the United States to reaffirm their dedication to farm safety and health and to express appreciation and gratitude to farmers, ranchers, and foresters for their important contributions to the nation.
