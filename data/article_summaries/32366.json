Yesterday, a district judge in California issued a nationwide injunction against a rule aimed at discouraging abuse of the asylum system, despite a ruling earlier in the day rejecting a similar request. The rule was established by the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to limit eligibility for asylum and encourage migrants to seek asylum in other countries they have traveled through before reaching the United States. The government plans to pursue all available options to address this ruling and defend the nation's borders. The statement criticizes the ability of plaintiffs to shop for sympathetic judges and suggests that this practice should be stopped.
