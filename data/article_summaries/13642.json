The Vice President released a statement on the eighteenth anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). He acknowledged the progress made since its passage, including giving law enforcement more tools to combat domestic violence and creating a national hotline for victims. The statement also highlighted a drop in annual rates of domestic violence by over 60%. However, the Vice President noted that there is still work to be done, as three women still die each day due to domestic violence, and many women have experienced rape or stalking. The Vice President urged Congress to reauthorize a strengthened VAWA to continue protecting women and girls.
