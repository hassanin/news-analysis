The White House is deeply disturbed by reports of an airstrike on a funeral hall in Yemen, which adds to the troubling attacks on Yemeni civilians. The United States has been assisting Saudi Arabia in defending their territorial integrity, but this support is not unconditional. In light of recent incidents, the U.S. has initiated a review of its reduced support to the Saudi-led Coalition and is prepared to adjust it to better align with U.S. principles, values, and interests. The U.S. calls on all parties involved to commit to an immediate cessation of hostilities based on the April 10th terms.
