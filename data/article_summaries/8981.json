The Vice President responded to a question about the recent Supreme Court ruling regarding S.B. 8 in Texas. She stated that the ruling is an attempt to undo decades of precedent and emphasized that a woman's right to make decisions about her own body is non-negotiable. The Biden administration will continue to fight for the constitutional right of all women to make decisions without interference from legislative groups.
