The President is transmitting a proposed Protocol to the Senate for ratification. The Protocol amends the existing Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters to align it with current international standards on exchange of information. It also updates the rules on confidentiality and permitted uses of exchanged tax information and allows countries other than OECD and Council of Europe members to adhere to the Convention. The Protocol entered into force on January 6, 2011, and the President recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to its ratification.
