The White House has released a statement expressing support for TransCanada's plan to build a pipeline to transport crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf of Mexico. The President believes that this project will help alleviate the current bottleneck of oil in Cushing and modernize infrastructure, create jobs, and encourage American energy production. The administration is committed to working with TransCanada to ensure that the pipeline is built safely and responsibly, and they will expedite the necessary Federal permits. Additionally, TransCanada has notified the State Department that they plan to submit a new application for the cross-border segment of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to Nebraska once a route through Nebraska has been identified. The President's previous rejection of the pipeline application in January does not impact future applications, and each project will undergo a thorough assessment before a permit decision is made.
