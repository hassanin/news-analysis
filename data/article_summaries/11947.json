The Obama Administration has announced new actions to promote competition in the airline industry and provide consumers with more information to make informed choices. These actions include requiring airlines to refund baggage fees for substantially delayed luggage, prohibiting airlines from cherry-picking data about their performance, and prohibiting online ticket agents from biasing flight offerings. The Department of Transportation will also explore requirements for airlines to provide all-in pricing information and review potentially unfair business practices. The Department is also appointing new members to the Advisory Committee for Aviation Consumer Protection to give consumers a voice in decision-making. These actions build on previous rules issued in 2009 and 2011 to enhance airline passenger protections, such as prohibiting excessive tarmac delays and requiring airlines to reimburse passengers for lost baggage. The Administration has also enforced consumer protection rules, resulting in millions of dollars in sanctions against airlines.
