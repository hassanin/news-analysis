He praised the efforts of community health organizations, social workers, and faith-based organizations in reducing opioid overdoses by 15% in Kentucky, compared to the national reduction of 5%. Pence announced that nearly $10 million in HHS grants will be provided to support Kentucky's efforts. Governor Bevin expressed gratitude for the support and emphasized the message of hope and progress in addressing healthcare needs. The Vice President and Secretary Azar also highlighted the positive impact of the military's healthcare services in underserved communities, including Kentucky.
