White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki held a press briefing where she discussed several topics. Psaki highlighted the severe consequences that the United States will face if Congress fails to provide $22.5 billion in emergency funding to fight COVID-19. The consequences include a shortage of monoclonal antibodies, fewer tests available, and a risk of running short on vaccines. Psaki emphasized the need for funding now to prepare for increasing cases of COVID-19. She also announced that President Biden will travel to Brussels, Belgium, later this month to attend a NATO summit and a European Council summit to discuss the situation in Ukraine. Psaki provided an update on the economic impacts of the sanctions on Russia, stating that they have hit hard at Putin's military, access to technology, and ability to project power and influence. She noted that trillions of dollars in businesses have been disrupted by sanctions, putting the Russian financial sector under severe stress. Psaki also mentioned that Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen and Attorney General Garland will host the launch meeting of the Russian elites, proxies, and oligarchs multilateral task force. The task force will collect and share information against Russian targets, including sanctions and asset freezing. Additionally, Psaki discussed the President's commitment to providing security assistance to Ukraine, including $13.6 billion in the omnibus bill that the President is set to sign. She highlighted the significant amount of military assistance that has already been provided to Ukraine and emphasized the importance of continuing to support them. Psaki also mentioned that today is Equal Pay Day and announced several actions taken by the Biden-Harris administration to promote women's empowerment and support working families. Finally, Psaki expressed condolences for the death of Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and noted that the President had been tested for COVID-19 and received a negative result.
