President Donald Trump spoke with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to discuss the situation in North Korea and the close coordination between the two countries. They both agreed that the maximum pressure policy, along with international solidarity, has brought them to a critical point. They also expressed their strong intention to continue close trilateral coordination with South Korea to maintain pressure and enforce international sanctions until North Korea takes tangible steps towards complete denuclearization. President Trump expressed hope that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's invitation indicates his desire to give the North Korean people a better future.
