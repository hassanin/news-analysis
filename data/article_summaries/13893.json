The article discusses the launch of the "U.S.-ASEAN Expanded Economic Engagement" (E3) initiative, which aims to expand trade and investment ties between the United States and ASEAN countries. The initiative will focus on facilitating trade and investment, increasing efficiency and competitiveness of trade flows, and building awareness of commercial opportunities. It also aims to prepare ASEAN countries to join high-standard trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The E3 initiative will involve negotiating a U.S.-ASEAN trade facilitation agreement, developing Information and Communications Technology principles, establishing Investment Principles, and working on standards development, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and trade and the environment. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will provide trade facilitation capacity-building assistance to ASEAN members. The initiative will also support ASEAN's goal of building an ASEAN Economic Community by 2015. ASEAN is an important trade partner for the United States, with a population of approximately 620 million and a combined GDP of over $2.2 trillion.
