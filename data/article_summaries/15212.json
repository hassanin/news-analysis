President Obama has announced the launch of Skills for America's Future, an initiative aimed at improving industry partnerships with community colleges and maximizing workforce development strategies. The goal is to create job training partnerships in all 50 states and connect employers with students looking for jobs. The initiative will facilitate partnerships with industry, labor unions, community colleges, and training providers. The President also announced the establishment of a federal Skills for America's Future Task Force to coordinate federal efforts. Several companies, including PG&E, McDonald's, United Technologies, and Gap Inc., have committed to being part of the initiative. In addition, Dr. Jill Biden will host the White House Summit on Community Colleges to highlight the role of community colleges in workforce development.
