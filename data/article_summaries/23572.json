The President announced that 13.7 million jobs have been added over the past 69 months, marking the longest streak on record. He also mentioned that a transportation bill was passed with bipartisan support, which will help to grow the economy and create more jobs. While acknowledging that the bill is not perfect, the President described it as a commonsense compromise and an important step in the right direction. He expressed his intention to sign the bill quickly in order to rebuild infrastructure and provide certainty for investment and hiring. The President also called for further action, including passing the GROW AMERICA Act, approving the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and avoiding a government shutdown. He emphasized that by taking these steps, the economy can continue to improve and provide opportunities for middle-class families.
