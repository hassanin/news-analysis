On January 25, 2009, the White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, issued a statement regarding an incident at the Executive Office Building. The D.C. Fire Department was called due to reports of smoke on the 4th floor. As a precaution, a limited number of staff were temporarily evacuated but have since returned to their offices. Fortunately, there were no injuries and no visible damage to the building.
