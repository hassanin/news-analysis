On the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the 15th Amendment, the right to vote is celebrated as one of the most fundamental and sacred rights of the Republic. The amendment was enacted after the Civil War to ensure that race, color, or previous servitude could no longer be used to deny voting rights to African American men. Fifty years later, with the ratification of the 19th Amendment, African American women also gained the right to vote, along with other adult women. The progress made in forming a more perfect union is acknowledged, as well as the challenges minorities and women have overcome and their ongoing contributions to advancing liberty and building a stronger America.
