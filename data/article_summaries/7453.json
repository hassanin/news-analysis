President Joe Biden has proclaimed September 2021 as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month in the United States. In his statement, he acknowledges the personal impact of cancer on families and the devastating toll it takes, particularly when it affects children. Despite advancements in medical science, cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease for American children between infancy and age 15. Biden emphasizes the need for more effective therapies and better understanding of the causes of pediatric cancer. He references the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, created during his tenure as Vice President under President Obama, and expresses his commitment to investing in research and care to combat cancer. Biden also highlights the progress being made in pediatric cancer research and technology, including immune-based treatments and precision medicine approaches. He mentions initiatives led by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to accelerate progress and develop safe and effective treatments for childhood cancers. The proclamation also emphasizes the support available to families and caregivers through the NCI and the Affordable Care Act's protections for childhood cancer patients. President Biden concludes by recognizing the efforts of healthcare professionals, researchers, philanthropies, and advocacy groups in providing hope and better treatments for children with cancer. He calls on citizens, government agencies, businesses, nonprofits, the media, and other interested groups to increase awareness and support for the fight against childhood cancer.
