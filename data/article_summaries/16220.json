President Barack Obama will award William Swenson, a former Army Captain, the Medal of Honor for his courageous actions during combat operations in Afghanistan on September 8, 2009. Swenson will be the sixth living recipient of the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan. He will be honored for his selfless service as an Embedded Trainer and Mentor of the Afghan National Security Forces. Swenson separated from the Army in 2011 and currently resides in Seattle, Washington. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who display gallantry and self-sacrifice above and beyond the call of duty in actions against an enemy or in military operations involving conflict with opposing forces.
