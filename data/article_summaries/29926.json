During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced that over 350 companies have raised wages, given bonuses, hired new employees, or increased retirement benefits as a result of the Trump tax cuts. She also discussed President Trump's proposal for rebuilding infrastructure in America and announced that he will donate his fourth-quarter salary to the Department of Transportation. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao accepted the check and spoke about the President's infrastructure proposal. Sanders then answered questions about the Rob Porter scandal and the security clearance process. She reiterated that the White House Personnel Security Office had not completed their process and made a recommendation to the White House when Porter resigned. Sanders also stated that the President takes all accusations of domestic violence seriously and supports the victims. She declined to comment on specific details of the Porter case and whether senior staff were aware of the allegations. Sanders mentioned that the White House is following the process used by previous administrations and that any changes to the process would need to be determined by the law enforcement and intelligence communities.
