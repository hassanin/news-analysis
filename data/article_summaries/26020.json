President Trump has extended the Coronavirus Guidelines for America for another 30 days in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. By following public health guidelines and practicing social distancing, it is estimated that more than 1 million American lives could be saved in the coming weeks and months. The coordination between the Federal Government and all 50 states has allowed for expedited access to much-needed medical supplies. The Surgeon General urges citizens to continue to flatten the curve by staying united and following guidelines.
