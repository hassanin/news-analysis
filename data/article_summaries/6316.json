Israel's Knesset has ratified a new government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The United States, under President Biden, looks forward to working with Netanyahu to address the challenges and opportunities in the Middle East, including the threats posed by Iran. The US aims to promote a region that is integrated, prosperous, and secure, benefiting all its people. The Biden administration will continue to support the two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians and oppose policies that jeopardize its viability or go against mutual interests and values.
