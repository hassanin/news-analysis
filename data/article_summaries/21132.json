The White House has announced a trade agreement between the United States and Panama, aimed at promoting economic growth and creating job opportunities. As part of this agreement, the two countries have implemented a Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) to improve transparency in tax information sharing. Panama has also made legislative and administrative efforts to strengthen labor laws and ensure compliance. These measures remove obstacles for the Obama administration to begin discussions with Congress on implementing the agreement. The trade agreement is expected to support jobs in the United States, expand markets, and improve competitiveness by eliminating tariffs and other barriers to American exports. Panama is one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, with a projected growth rate of 6.2% until 2015.
