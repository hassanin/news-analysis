The article discusses an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in October 2014 aimed at improving the security of consumer financial transactions in the United States. The order emphasizes the need to enhance the security of data in the financial marketplace, given the risk of identity crimes and the economic consequences of data breaches.

The order directs government agencies to transition payment processing terminals and credit, debit, and other payment cards to employ enhanced security features, including chip-and-PIN technology. It also requires agencies to develop plans for installing enabling software that supports these enhanced security features. The General Services Administration is instructed to ensure that credit, debit, and other payment cards provided through their contracts have enhanced security features.

The order also focuses on improving identity theft remediation. Federal law enforcement agencies are directed to regularly submit compromised credentials to the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance's Internet Fraud Alert System. The Department of Justice, Department of Commerce, and Social Security Administration are instructed to identify agency resources for victims of identity theft and provide this information to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for consolidation on the FTC's public website, IdentityTheft.gov. The FTC is also tasked with enhancing the functionality of IdentityTheft.gov and coordinating with credit bureaus to streamline the reporting and remediation process.

Additionally, the order calls for a plan to ensure that all agencies making personal data accessible to citizens through digital applications require the use of multiple factors of authentication and an effective identity proofing process.

The order concludes with general provisions, emphasizing that it should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It also states that the order does not impair existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits enforceable against the United States or its entities.

Overall, the executive order aims to strengthen the security of consumer financial transactions by implementing enhanced security features, improving identity theft remediation, and securing federal transactions online.
