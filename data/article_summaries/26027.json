President Donald Trump has returned a joint resolution, S.J. Res. 68, to the Senate without his approval. The resolution aimed to direct the President to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces in hostilities against Iran. Trump argues that the resolution is unnecessary and dangerous, as it would weaken his authority as Commander in Chief and endanger American citizens and service members. He states that the United States is not engaged in the use of force against Iran due to his decisive actions and effective policies. Trump also argues that the military airstrike against Qassem Soleimani in Iraq was conducted with statutory authority under the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 and his constitutional authorities. He further contends that the resolution could hinder his ability to protect US forces, allies, and partners from the threat posed by Iran and Iranian-backed militias. Trump concludes that he cannot support the joint resolution and it would undermine his ability to protect American citizens, service members, and interests.
