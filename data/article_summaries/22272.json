President Obama and Chancellor Merkel of Germany discussed the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, particularly the recent violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity by Russia sending a convoy into Ukraine without Ukraine's approval. They expressed concern about the large number of Russian troops on the border of Ukraine, the presence of Russian military personnel in Ukraine, and Russian shelling of Ukrainian territory. Both leaders emphasized the need for Russia to remove its convoy from Ukrainian territory, accept the conditions agreed to with Ukraine and the International Red Cross for humanitarian convoys, and de-escalate the situation by withdrawing its military forces, weapons, vehicles, and personnel from Ukraine. They also stressed the importance of a bilateral ceasefire, closing the border, and effective border monitoring.
