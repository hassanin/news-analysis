The White House has launched the 2011 Race to the Top Commencement Challenge, inviting public high schools across the country to demonstrate how they prepare students for college and careers. The winning school will have President Obama as their commencement speaker. The application requires essay questions and statistical information that highlight the school's efforts in promoting college and career readiness for all students. The deadline for submissions is February 25th. Last year, over 1,000 schools applied, and the President selected the national winner from the three high schools with the highest average ratings. This year, the President is calling on high schools to share effective strategies on how they are preparing students to achieve the goal of having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020.
