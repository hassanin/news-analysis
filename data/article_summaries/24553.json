The United States is deeply concerned about the fragile situation in South Sudan and urges President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar to take immediate steps to end the conflict. The US welcomes their agreement to send representatives for talks mediated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. They call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and full humanitarian access to civilian populations. The US will deny support and apply international pressure to any elements that use force to seize power. They will also hold leaders responsible for the conduct of their forces and work to ensure accountability for atrocities and war crimes. The US strongly supports the UN Mission in South Sudan and calls on all parties to allow it to carry out its mandate without obstruction. The US is deeply concerned about reports of serious human rights abuses allegedly committed by government forces and militias. They emphasize that human rights abuses are unacceptable and hinder the path toward reconciliation. It is important for all South Sudanese to reject violence and for leaders to call upon their forces to protect civilians.
