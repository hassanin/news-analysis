President Biden and Vice President Harris have announced the development of the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia in the United States. This strategy aims to address the disproportionate number of hate-fueled attacks and discriminatory incidents against Muslims in America, as well as those perceived to be Muslim, such as Arabs and Sikhs. The strategy will be a joint effort led by the Domestic Policy Council and the National Security Council. This announcement is part of President Biden's directive to establish an interagency group to counter Islamophobia, Antisemitism, and related forms of bias and discrimination. The administration is committed to ensuring that every American can live their lives in safety and without fear based on their religious beliefs or identity.
