The author, Kevin Hassett, discusses the features and benefits of the Administration's tax plan, known as the Unified Framework, and criticizes the analysis of the plan by the Tax Policy Center. Hassett emphasizes the importance of considering the impact of taxes on economic growth and argues that the Tax Policy Center's analysis, which concludes that the Unified Framework would have zero effect on growth, is baffling. He points out that there is a bipartisan consensus that taxes influence growth and cites examples of tax policies implemented by President Obama and President Macron of France. Hassett also highlights the need for the United States to compete in the global economy by lowering its corporate tax rate, which has remained stagnant while other countries have lowered theirs. He concludes by stating that the Unified Framework is supported by scientific evidence accumulated over decades.
