Second Lady Karen Pence traveled to Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, Colorado to deliver a speech on the important role of military spouses in the defense of the country. This speech marks the beginning of Mrs. Pence's campaign to elevate, encourage, and thank military spouses across the nation. Mrs. Pence has gained a better understanding of military life through roundtable discussions and meetings with military spouses. She believes that military spouses are competent, well-educated, flexible, hardworking, and essential assets to the country. During her visit to Fort Carson, Mrs. Pence distributed care packages called "With you All the Way! Dealing with Deployment Comfort Kits" to children with a deployed parent. These kits contain various items to help children cope with separation, including an animated DVD, a guided journal, a teddy bear, a guidebook, and items to keep the family connected. Mrs. Pence was accompanied by several military spouses, including the wives of Secretary of the Army, the Army's Chief of Staff, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, and the White House Chief of Staff.
