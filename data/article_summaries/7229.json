The Vice President addressed the issue of home appraisal in a teleconference, highlighting the importance of homeownership and the wealth-building opportunities it provides. She acknowledged the historical inequities faced by people of color in accessing homeownership and how these inequities persist in the home appraisal system. Black homeowners are more likely to have their homes undervalued, leading to higher mortgage costs, lower selling prices, and limited access to home equity lines of credit, which further widens the racial wealth gap. The Vice President shared the story of a couple who had their home undervalued but received a higher appraisal after a white friend posed as the homeowner during a second appraisal. She emphasized the need for systemic change and outlined several measures taken by the administration, such as anti-bias training for appraisers, expanding training pipelines for underrepresented groups, and developing a rule to ensure appraisal algorithms are not biased. The administration is also releasing new guidance to make it easier for consumers to appeal biased valuations and making public data on home valuations to bring transparency to the issue. These steps aim to create a more just and equitable home valuation system.
