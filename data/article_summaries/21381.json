President Barack Obama has proclaimed November 2013 as National Adoption Month in the United States. The proclamation recognizes the importance of adoptive families in providing loving homes for over a million children and teenagers. It also highlights the need to support children still in foster care and without permanent families. The proclamation mentions National Adoption Day on November 23, which aims to finalize adoptions and provide hope to children waiting for adoptive parents. The Obama Administration has worked to simplify adoption laws, reduce the time children spend without parents, and ensure adoption rights for qualified couples and individuals. The Administration has also signed legislation to extend the Adoption Tax Credit and promote safe and lawful adoptions through the Intercountry Adoption Universal Accreditation Act. The proclamation encourages Americans to observe National Adoption Month by finding permanent families for children in need and supporting the families who care for them.
