During a recent press briefing, key points were discussed regarding the current COVID-19 situation. It was emphasized that the coming weeks will be challenging due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant. However, there are three important things to focus on. First, there are tools available to keep ourselves and our communities safe, including proven prevention measures in schools and the availability of vaccines and boosters. Second, the impact of rising cases depends on vaccination status, with vaccinated individuals being highly protected against severe illness. Unvaccinated individuals are at a higher risk of severe illness and should get vaccinated. Third, the Biden administration is deploying measures to support states, communities, and hospitals in dealing with the Omicron challenge, including the deployment of military personnel, the provision of personal protective equipment, the establishment of testing locations, and the stockpiling of COVID treatments. The briefing also provided updates on the Omicron variant, indicating that it is less severe than previous variants but can still stress the healthcare system due to the large number of cases. The importance of vaccination and continued adherence to preventive measures was emphasized, particularly for healthcare workers. The briefing also addressed questions about testing, including the availability and cost of rapid tests.
