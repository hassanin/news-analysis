The Biden-Harris Administration has announced the Climate Smart Buildings Initiative, a government-wide effort to modernize Federal buildings, create jobs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The initiative will leverage public-private partnerships to upgrade existing buildings, with the government paying for renovations using future energy savings instead of upfront taxpayer funding. By setting emissions reduction targets, the initiative aims to attract over $8 billion of private sector investment by 2030 through energy savings performance contracts. It is expected to create nearly 80,000 jobs and achieve up to 2.8 million metric tons of GHG reductions annually by 2030. The initiative will also increase investments from performance contracts from $251 million in FY2021 to $1.2 billion per year by 2030. The efforts will focus on increasing clean electricity generation, incorporating clean energy technology, improving lighting and insulation, and installing electric vehicle supply equipment. The initiative is part of the President's Federal Sustainability Plan, which aims to reduce emissions from Federal buildings by 50% by 2032 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. Federal agencies have already been utilizing performance contracting to achieve these goals.
