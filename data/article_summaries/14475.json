President Obama has proposed a plan to reform and reorganize the government in order to make it more efficient and consumer-friendly. He wants Congress to reinstate his authority to streamline and consolidate the federal government, eliminating duplication, waste, and inefficiencies. The President's proposal includes mandating that any plan must reduce the number of government agencies or save taxpayer dollars, as well as ensuring expedient review by Congress. The first proposed use of this authority is to consolidate six agencies into one more efficient agency focused on promoting competitiveness, exports, and American business. This consolidation will help entrepreneurs and businesses grow, compete, and hire. The President established the Government Reform for Competitiveness and Innovation Initiative to examine how the Federal government can better support America's competitiveness in the global economy. The initiative found that many businesses are confused about where to go for assistance and are often unaware of available services, especially those trying to break into the export market.
