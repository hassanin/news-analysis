The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has recognized members of Colombia's military and law enforcement who have been severely wounded in their efforts against drug trafficking and terrorism. These individuals also participated in the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, D.C. ONDCP Director Jim Carroll commended their courage and bravery, highlighting the partnership between the United States and Colombia in reducing coca cultivation and cocaine production. The use of landmines in Colombia has increased, particularly in areas where coca plants are present, resulting in severe injuries for National Police officers and civilians involved in eradication activities. Military service members make up around 70% of landmine victims in Colombia, and there was a 300% increase in landmine victims in 2018 compared to 2017. While coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia remain high, there has been a leveling off in 2018, marking the first year without an increase since 2012.
