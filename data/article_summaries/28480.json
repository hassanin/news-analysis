On Women's Equality Day, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation to commemorate the 99th anniversary of the adoption of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote in the United States. The proclamation acknowledges the efforts of suffragists and celebrates the achievements of women. The Trump administration is working to empower and promote women through economic policies, such as tax cuts and job creation, as well as supporting working parents with measures like paid family leave. The administration is also focused on breaking down barriers for women in STEM fields and launched the Women's Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative. The proclamation encourages the celebration of women's achievements and calls for appropriate programs and activities to observe the day.
