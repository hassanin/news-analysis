A federal district judge in Texas has ruled that a prescription medication used for medication abortion should no longer be approved in the United States. This medication has been available for over 22 years, approved by the FDA, and used safely by millions of women. The judge's ruling undermines the authority of the FDA and opens the door for political and ideological attacks on other FDA-approved drugs. This ruling affects not only women in Texas but also women in every state, regardless of the legality of abortion. It is seen as a significant step towards a national ban on abortion, which Republican officials have vowed to implement. The Biden Administration plans to fight this ruling, with the Department of Justice already filing an appeal and seeking an immediate stay of the decision. However, the ultimate solution to protect women's rights and freedoms is to elect a Congress that will pass a law restoring Roe v. Wade. President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to leading the fight to protect a woman's right to an abortion and her ability to make decisions about her own health.
