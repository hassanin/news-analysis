President Trump traveled to Indiana to discuss the unified tax reform framework aimed at fixing the broken tax code. He expressed his thoughts and prayers for the people of Puerto Rico who were affected by Hurricane Maria and announced his plans to visit the island to assess the damage. The tax reform framework aims to achieve pro-American, fiscally responsible tax reform to strengthen the middle class, grow the economy, and bring fiscal responsibility. The plan includes cutting taxes for hardworking Americans, simplifying the tax code, lowering the business tax rate to 20 percent, and encouraging businesses to return from overseas. The goal is to give American workers and businesses a level playing field and make the country competitive on the world stage. President Trump closed his speech by emphasizing the importance of this moment in history, where ordinary Americans took control of their destiny and chose a future of American patriotism, prosperity, and pride.
