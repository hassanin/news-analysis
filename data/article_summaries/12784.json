This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on December 2, 2011. The memorandum focuses on the implementation of energy savings projects and performance-based contracting for energy savings in federal buildings. The goal is to reduce energy costs, cut pollution, and create jobs in the construction and energy sectors. The memorandum directs executive departments and agencies to evaluate their facilities, identify potential savings, and leverage both private and public sector funding to invest in comprehensive energy conservation projects. It also sets a target of $2 billion in performance-based contracts for federal building energy efficiency within 24 months. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of prioritizing energy conservation measures with a payback time of less than 10 years and encourages the use of installation-wide and portfolio-wide performance contracts. It also highlights the need for transparency and accountability in tracking and reporting facility energy usage data. The memorandum applies to agency activities, personnel, resources, and facilities within the United States, with possible exemptions for national security purposes.
