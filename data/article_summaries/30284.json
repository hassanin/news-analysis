President Donald J. Trump wrote an editorial in the Journal Sentinel, calling for the reform of the US tax code. He argues that the current tax system is self-destructive and causes Americans to lose jobs, waste trillions of dollars, and spend billions of hours on compliance and paperwork. Trump wants to work with Congress to create a tax plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, and pro-American. The plan aims to reduce income taxes, double the standard deduction, simplify the tax code, and bring back American jobs. Trump cites President Ronald Reagan's success in cutting the business tax rate in 1986, which led to economic growth and increased middle-class income. He believes that fixing the tax system will restore confidence and hope for American workers and businesses. Trump urges Congress to create a level playing field for workers, attract companies to the US, and put more money in the pockets of hardworking people.
