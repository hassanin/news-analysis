The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through the House Ways and Means Committee is seen as an important step towards providing tax relief for the American people. The President's priorities throughout this process have been to deliver tax cuts for middle-income families, simplify the tax code, and lower rates for American businesses to promote growth, job creation, higher wages, and competitiveness. While there is still work to be done, the Administration is confident that through continued cooperation with Congress, these priorities will be achieved this year.
