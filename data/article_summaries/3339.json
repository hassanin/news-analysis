In this article, the author discusses the importance of college education as a pathway to the middle class and the steps taken by the current administration to alleviate the burden of student loans. The administration has discharged $39 billion of loans for over 800,000 borrowers who have been repaying their loans for 20 years or more. This is part of the administration's efforts to provide relief, which has resulted in over $116 billion in loan relief to over 3 million borrowers in the past two years. Additionally, the administration has increased Pell Grants, fixed broken loan programs, and introduced an income-driven repayment plan to reduce loan payments for low-income borrowers. The author criticizes Republican lawmakers for opposing these relief efforts, highlighting their hypocrisy in benefiting from loan forgiveness for their own businesses while objecting to similar relief for hardworking Americans. The author concludes by expressing a commitment to continue working towards making college education accessible to all Americans.
