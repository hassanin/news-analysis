The article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney on the President's appointment of Richard Cordray as consumer watchdog for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Carney emphasizes that Cordray is highly qualified and has broad bipartisan support, but his nomination has been blocked by Senate Republicans. The President is appointing Cordray during the Senate recess because he believes Americans need someone to protect their interests in dealing with financial institutions. Carney also mentions that the President's decision to save the American automobile industry has been vindicated by impressive sales results. He addresses legal challenges to the recess appointment and states that the President has the constitutional authority to make it. Carney argues that the opposition to Cordray is based on opposition to the CFPB itself and a belief that financial institutions do not need oversight. He also discusses the President's commitment to working with Congress but states that when Congress refuses to act, the President will act. Carney mentions the President's hope for cooperation with Congress on various measures to grow the economy and create jobs. He concludes by stating that the President's appointment of Cordray is in the best interest of the American people and that the President will continue to act when Congress does not.
