The article is an executive order issued by President Barack Obama on January 30, 2009, titled "Notification of Employee Rights Under Federal Labor Laws." The order aims to promote economy and efficiency in government procurement by ensuring that government contracts are performed by contractors whose work will not be interrupted by labor unrest. It emphasizes the importance of workers being well-informed of their rights under federal labor laws, particularly the National Labor Relations Act. The order requires all government contracting departments and agencies to include certain provisions in their contracts, such as posting notices of employee rights and compliance with labor laws. The Secretary of Labor is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the order, including investigating violations and imposing sanctions on non-compliant contractors. The order also allows for exemptions and provides remedies in case of non-compliance. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council is tasked with implementing the order in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The order revokes a previous executive order on the same subject.
