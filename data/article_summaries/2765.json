In honor of National Ocean Month, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. emphasizes the importance of the world's ocean basins and their impact on our economy, food supply, oxygen production, recreational activities, and regulation of weather patterns and the global climate system. The administration is committed to protecting and sustaining the ocean and coasts for current and future generations. The "America the Beautiful" initiative aims to conserve at least 30 percent of US lands and waters by 2030, ensuring the preservation of natural resources that provide food, clean air, and clean water. The administration also focuses on supporting safe and sustainable seafood harvesting, addressing public health risks like harmful algal blooms resulting from climate change and water acidification. Expanding offshore wind energy will create clean energy sources and union jobs, while investing in resilient coastal infrastructure will protect the economy and communities from rising seas and storms. Conservation and restoration of coastal wetlands and habitats will aid in climate change mitigation and the resilience of coastal communities. The administration recognizes the connection between climate change and the ocean, highlighting the need to protect ocean ecosystems and resources to safeguard worldwide economies and people. Collaboration with international partners is crucial to global conservation and sustainability efforts. The administration is dedicated to achieving climate justice and ensuring equitable access to the ocean and coasts for all Americans, particularly Indigenous Americans, Black Americans, and communities of color. Education and empowerment of the youth to become ocean stewards are prioritized. President Biden urges action to conserve, protect, and restore the ocean for its continued health and prosperity.
