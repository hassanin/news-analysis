This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on November 13, 2014. The memorandum authorizes the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to exercise authority under Public Law 85-804, as amended, with respect to contracts performed in Africa in support of USAID's response to the Ebola outbreak. This authority allows USAID to hold harmless and indemnify contractors, their employees, or subcontractors who may have significant exposure to Ebola while performing these contracts. The memorandum states that USAID is exercising functions in connection with the national defense and there is a state of national emergency that authorizes the use of Public Law 85-804. The memorandum also clarifies that it does not create any legal rights or benefits enforceable against the United States or any other party. The memorandum concludes by directing the publication of the memorandum in the Federal Register.
