President Obama congratulates Senator Joe Lieberman on his retirement and highlights his extraordinary career in public service. Lieberman has fought for what he believes in on behalf of the people of Connecticut for four decades. He has worked on various issues such as cracking down on polluters, defending national security, and repealing "Don't Ask Don't Tell". The President acknowledges that while they may not always see eye to eye, he respects Lieberman's principled approach. Obama believes that Lieberman will continue to carry his integrity and dedication to his remaining work in the Senate and whatever he chooses to do next.
