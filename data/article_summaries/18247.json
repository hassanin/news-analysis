The Obama Administration has announced a new initiative to increase access to solar energy for all Americans, especially low- and moderate-income communities. The key components of the initiative include launching a National Community Solar Partnership to unlock access to solar for renters and those without adequate roof space, setting a goal to install 300 megawatts of renewable energy in federally subsidized housing, and securing commitments from housing authorities, power companies, and organizations across the country to put in place over 260 solar energy projects. Additionally, more than $520 million in financial commitments have been made to advance community solar and scale up solar and energy efficiency for low- and moderate-income households. The Administration is also taking executive actions to make it easier to install solar on affordable housing and to promote solar education and job training. The solar industry is also committing to becoming the most diverse sector of the U.S. energy industry, and a number of companies are taking steps to build a more inclusive solar workforce.
