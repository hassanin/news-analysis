The Biden Administration has made reopening schools safely a top priority. They have taken significant actions to ensure that students can return to the classroom, with over 96% of school districts open for full-time in-person learning this fall. The administration emphasizes the importance of implementing science-based prevention strategies, such as vaccination, universal indoor masking, physical distancing, improved ventilation, and regular screening testing for students and staff. As part of their COVID-19 Action Plan, the administration has provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 screening testing in K-12 schools. They are also announcing additional actions to help states and school districts establish screening testing programs in more schools.
