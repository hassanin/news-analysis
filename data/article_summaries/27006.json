The executive order issued on October 21, 2020, focuses on the appointment and management of career professionals in the federal service. The order emphasizes the importance of having individuals in positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating nature who possess appropriate temperament, acumen, impartiality, and sound judgment.

The order highlights the need for agencies to have greater flexibility in appointing employees to these positions, as well as the importance of effective performance management. It acknowledges that the current performance management system is inadequate, as revealed by the 2016 Merit Principles Survey.

To address these issues, the order establishes Schedule F of the excepted service, which includes positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character that are not normally subject to change during a Presidential transition. Placing these positions in the excepted service allows agencies to have more flexibility in assessing and selecting candidates, without the limitations imposed by competitive service selection procedures.

The order also exempts positions in Schedule F from certain adverse action procedures, making it easier for agencies to remove poorly performing employees. It requires agency heads to conduct reviews of positions covered by subchapter II of chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, within specific timeframes and determine whether they should be included in Schedule F.

Furthermore, the order calls for agencies to establish rules prohibiting prohibited personnel practices for employees in Schedule F. It includes general provisions that clarify the implementation of the order and its limitations.

Overall, the executive order aims to improve the appointment and management of career professionals in positions of importance within the federal service, promoting effective performance and efficient agency operations.
