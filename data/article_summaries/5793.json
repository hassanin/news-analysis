During a recent press briefing, Jeff Zients, the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator, discussed the implications of the FDA and CDC's decision to pause the administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. He emphasized that the pause will not have a significant impact on the vaccination program, as the J&J vaccine makes up less than 5% of the total shots administered in the US. Zients reassured the public that there is enough supply of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to continue the current pace of vaccinations and meet the goal of administering 200 million shots by President Biden's 100th day in office. He also mentioned that efforts are underway to quickly reschedule individuals who were scheduled to receive the J&J vaccine for a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC Director, provided an update on the decision to pause the J&J vaccine, explaining that it was done out of an abundance of caution due to six reported cases of a rare and severe blood clotting disorder in individuals who had received the vaccine. She stated that these cases are extremely rare but are being investigated to determine if there is a causal relationship with the vaccine. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Chief Medical Advisor to the President, addressed concerns about vaccine hesitancy following the J&J pause, stating that the action taken by the FDA and CDC should actually reinforce confidence in the safety of vaccines, as it shows that safety monitoring systems are working effectively. The press briefing also touched on topics such as vaccine passports and the ongoing efforts to combat vaccine hesitancy.
