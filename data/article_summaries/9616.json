The White House hosted a call with 34 governors to provide information about refugee admissions policies and security screening measures. The call was led by White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and included representatives from the Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, FBI, National Counterterrorism Center, and Department of Health and Human Services. The officials discussed the rigorous screening process for refugees coming to the United States, with 13 governors asking questions. The officials emphasized that the safety of the American people is the top priority and reiterated the thorough vetting process for refugees. Some governors expressed appreciation for the opportunity to understand the process and address their concerns directly, while others requested further communication to better respond to public inquiries. McDonough also committed to working with the National Governors Association to improve information sharing and maintain an ongoing dialogue.
