One year ago, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden launched the Cancer Moonshot initiative with the goal of reducing the death rate from cancer by at least 50% over the next 25 years. The initiative has led to significant progress, with over 25 new programs, policies, and resources announced to address key priority areas such as closing the screening gap, addressing environmental exposure, decreasing preventable cancers, advancing research, and supporting patients and caregivers. The First Lady has also traveled to meet with cancer patients, healthcare professionals, and researchers to emphasize the importance of early detection and improving the patient experience. In addition, the President plans to appoint six members to the National Cancer Advisory Board to guide the national cancer research program. The Cancer Cabinet and both the public and private sectors are taking new actions to promote cancer prevention, support patients and caregivers, expand cancer screening, and drive research advances through data sharing and clinical trial expansion. These efforts build upon the progress made in the first year of the Cancer Moonshot initiative.
