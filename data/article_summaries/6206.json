President Biden met with a group of five mayors representing the African American Mayors Association (AAMA) to express gratitude for their strong partnership. The President emphasized his commitment to collaborating with mayors on various priority issues affecting all Americans. This includes the implementation of his Investing in America Agenda, which encompasses initiatives like the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. The mayors discussed key initiatives related to public safety, housing, and environmental justice following the President's executive order signing. They also talked about the positive impact of the Investing in America agenda in their communities. The meeting underscores the importance the Biden-Harris Administration places on working with mayors to deliver results for the American people. The mayors were in Washington, D.C. for the African American Mayors Association's 9th Annual Conference, where Vice President Kamala Harris hosted a reception for over 80 AAMA mayors at her residence.
