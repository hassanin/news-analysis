The President commends the Senate for rejecting Senator Murkowski's resolution, which would have increased dependence on oil by blocking efforts to reduce pollution that contributes to climate change. This vote emphasizes the need to pass legislation for a clean energy economy that creates jobs, strengthens national security, and protects the environment. The Senate chose to move America forward towards a clean energy economy instead of relying on failed policies that increase dependence on foreign oil.
