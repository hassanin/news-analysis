The Biden-Harris Administration has announced a cybersecurity certification and labeling program called the "U.S. Cyber Trust Mark" to help consumers choose safer and less vulnerable smart devices. The program, proposed by FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, aims to raise the bar for cybersecurity across common devices such as refrigerators, microwaves, televisions, climate control systems, and fitness trackers. Major manufacturers and retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, Google, LG Electronics U.S.A., Logitech, and Samsung Electronics, have made voluntary commitments to increase cybersecurity for the products they sell. The program would involve a distinct shield logo applied to products that meet established cybersecurity criteria, as determined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The FCC is expected to seek public comment on rolling out the program, which is anticipated to be operational by 2024. The program aims to provide consumers with tools to make informed decisions about the security of the products they bring into their homes.
