The United States Congress has passed the bipartisan Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022, which is the largest expansion of benefits for service-connected health issues in 30 years. This bill aims to address exposure to burn pits and provide quicker access to healthcare services and other benefits for millions of veterans who may have been exposed to harmful toxins. It also includes provisions for surviving spouses and children, such as a monthly stipend, tuition benefits, life insurance, home loan assistance, and help with healthcare. The bill is seen as a decisive and bipartisan win for America's veterans, and the President looks forward to signing it into law.
