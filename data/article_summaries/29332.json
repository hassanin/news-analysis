President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in Oregon due to the wildfires that began on September 8, 2020. This declaration allows for Federal assistance to supplement local response efforts. The Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will coordinate all disaster relief efforts aimed at alleviating the hardship caused by the emergency. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources to mitigate the impacts of the emergency, and emergency protective measures will be funded at 75% by the Federal government. Dolph A. Diemont has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
