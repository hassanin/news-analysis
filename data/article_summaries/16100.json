President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for Massachusetts in response to severe storms and flooding that occurred in March 2010. The declaration allows for federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding is available for individuals in Bristol, Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester Counties. Assistance may include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Hazard mitigation measures are also eligible for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. James N. Russo has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners who suffered losses can apply for assistance online or by phone. Further information can be obtained from FEMA.
