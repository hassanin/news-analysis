President Obama has launched the Citizens Medal Public Nomination Process, inviting the American public to nominate candidates for the Citizens Medal, the nation's second highest civilian award. The Presidential Citizens Medal has recognized Americans who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or fellow citizens for over 40 years. The President hopes to recognize local heroes and exemplary citizens who have significantly impacted their communities but may not have received national attention. Public nominations will be reviewed by White House staff, with the recipients selected by the President. The Citizens Medal will be awarded in a ceremony at the White House in late spring. Nominees must be U.S. citizens and fulfill specific criteria. The nomination form is available on the White House website, and nominations must be submitted by January 28, 2010. The Citizens Medal recognizes citizens who have performed exemplary deeds of service outside of their regular jobs, with a focus on individuals who have demonstrated commitment to service, helped their country or fellow citizens through extraordinary acts, worked to combat persistent problems, and had a sustained impact on others' lives.
