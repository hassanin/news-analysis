This article is the text of an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2015. The order establishes a Law Enforcement Equipment Working Group, which is tasked with improving the coordination and oversight of federal support for the acquisition of equipment by state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. The working group is responsible for developing recommendations on a range of issues, including standardizing procedures for providing equipment, ensuring proper training for law enforcement agencies, preventing misuse or abuse of equipment, and ensuring compliance with civil rights requirements. The working group is also directed to engage with external stakeholders, such as state officials, law enforcement organizations, and civil rights groups, in developing its recommendations. The working group is required to provide the president with implementation plans for its recommendations within specific timeframes. The executive order also includes general provisions, such as clarifying that it does not impair the authority of any agency or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
