President Biden addressed the media regarding the federal response to the situation in Puerto Rico after the recent storm. He expressed his commitment to providing immediate assistance and resources to the people of Puerto Rico and acknowledged the significant impact of the storm on the island, especially considering the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria five years ago. The President approved a declaration of emergency before the storm made landfall, allowing federal resources to be mobilized quickly. He thanked FEMA Administrator Criswell for personally assessing the situation in Puerto Rico and ensuring that the necessary aid is provided. The federal government has deployed search and rescue teams, bilingual assistance teams, and power restoration experts to assist with recovery efforts. The President also acknowledged the role of local first responders, including the Puerto Rican National Guard, and emphasized the importance of mental health support for survivors and responders. He thanked the New York congressional delegation for their support and announced a major disaster declaration that provides individual and public assistance for recovery efforts. The declaration includes 100% federal funding for debris removal, search and rescue, power and water restoration, and shelter and food for the month. The President reassured the people of Puerto Rico that the federal government will continue to support them and emphasized that they are not alone in this recovery process.
