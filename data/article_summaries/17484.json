The White House is hosting a three-day summit on Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) to address the issue of radicalization and recruitment to violence by extremist groups. The summit aims to bring together local, federal, and international leaders to discuss concrete steps that can be taken to develop community-oriented approaches to counter extremist ideologies. The United States government's policy to counter violent extremism domestically focuses on empowering local communities and strengthening community partnerships. Three pilot programs have been created in Greater Boston, Los Angeles, and the Twin Cities to foster partnerships between local government, law enforcement, and other stakeholders to prevent violent extremism. The federal government supports these efforts by appointing a full-time CVE Coordinator, establishing an Office for Strategic Engagement in Los Angeles, seeking funding for community-led prevention efforts, and sponsoring workshops and symposiums for collaboration and sharing best practices. Globally, the United States is working with other nations to address violent extremism through the United Nations General Assembly and by focusing on the recruitment of foreign fighters. The summit also aims to widen the global base of CVE stakeholders by countering extremist messaging through social media, engaging with religious leaders and faith communities, supporting civil society, and promoting youth engagement.
