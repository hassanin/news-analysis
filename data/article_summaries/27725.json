The American economy added 164,000 jobs in April, bringing the unemployment rate down to 3.9 percent, the lowest since 2000. Key sectors such as manufacturing, construction, and mining and logging saw job growth. Under President Trump, the African American unemployment rate reached its lowest level ever recorded at 6.6 percent, and the unemployment rate for adult women dropped to 3.5 percent, the lowest in over 17 years. The U-6 unemployment rate, which includes discouraged workers and part-time workers, also fell to 7.8 percent, the lowest since July 2001. President Trump's tax cuts, deregulation, and pro-growth policies are credited for creating jobs and boosting confidence in the economy. The economy has grown by 2.9 percent over the last four quarters, with over 3.1 million jobs created since Trump's election. Consumer confidence is also near an 18-year high.
