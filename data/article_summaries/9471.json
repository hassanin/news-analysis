The article discusses the fifth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and highlights the key facts and reports regarding its impact. It mentions that before the ACA, millions of Americans lacked health care coverage, but now millions of working and middle-class families have the security of knowing they won't go bankrupt if they get sick. The ACA has improved coverage by reducing the uninsured rate, with over 16 million Americans gaining health coverage. It has also improved affordability by slowing down the rise in health care prices, and it has enhanced the quality of health care, resulting in 50,000 fewer patient deaths in hospitals due to avoidable harms. The article also mentions that Republicans in Congress have repeatedly voted to repeal the ACA, but it argues that the country would be stronger if they stopped fighting old political battles.
