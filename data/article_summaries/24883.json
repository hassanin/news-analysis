The Obama Administration has announced a new initiative called Let Girls Learn, which aims to help adolescent girls worldwide attend and complete school. Currently, 62 million girls, half of whom are adolescents, are not in school. This initiative will expand on existing investments and successes in global primary school education and focus on helping adolescent girls complete their education. The initiative will encourage and support community-led solutions to reduce barriers that prevent girls from completing their education. The Peace Corps will play a key role in this initiative by supporting community-generated and community-led girls' education projects worldwide. The Let Girls Learn program will be phased in globally, starting in 11 countries, with additional countries to be phased in later. The initiative has received commitments of support from various organizations, including the Brookings Institution, CARE, Girl Rising, Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., and the UN Foundation/Girl Up. The U.S. Government will work together across various agencies to address the challenges facing adolescent girls around the world. Existing programs across the government focus on education, empowerment/leadership, health and nutrition, preventing gender-based violence, preventing child, early and forced marriage, and partnerships with bilateral and multilateral partners. These programs aim to improve girls' access to education, provide leadership opportunities, address health and nutrition issues, and prevent gender-based violence and child marriage.
