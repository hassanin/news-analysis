The United States expresses deep concern over reports of mass arrests, sham trials, and a death sentence for Iranian protesters. The government's systematic denial of basic dignity and freedom to its people is alarming. This comes as political prisoner Hossein Ronaghi is transferred to a hospital in Tehran after reports of torture. The international community must hold Iran accountable for its human rights abuses, including the killing of hundreds of protestors. The United States, along with its partners and allies, will pursue sanctions and other means to seek justice for these abuses. The European Union and the United Kingdom have recently imposed sanctions on 29 individuals and three entities involved in the violent crackdown on protestors. The United States firmly supports the Iranian people and their demands.
