The White House will be hosting an event called "The Gospel Tradition: In Performance at the White House" to honor gospel music and its important artists and repertoire. The event will feature performances by various artists including Bishop Rance Allen, Pastor Shirley Caesar, Aretha Franklin, and Michelle Williams. The President's remarks will be streamed live on WhiteHouse.gov, and the event will be broadcast on PBS stations and TV One. In addition, the First Lady will host a daytime workshop for students, where they will learn about the history of gospel music and interact with the performers. This event is part of a series of music events hosted by the White House during President Barack Obama's administration.
