This article discusses Executive Order 13566, which was issued by President Barack Obama in 2011. The order blocks the property and prohibits certain transactions related to Libya. It states that the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates have posed a serious threat to the people of Libya, including the use of weapons of war and violence against unarmed civilians. The order aims to protect Libyan state assets from being misappropriated by Qadhafi and his associates. It blocks the property and interests in property of certain individuals and entities, including senior officials of the Libyan government and Qadhafi's family members. The order also prohibits the transfer, payment, export, withdrawal, or other dealing with the property and interests in property of the Government of Libya, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities, and the Central Bank of Libya. The order includes provisions to prevent transactions that evade or violate its prohibitions. It also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take necessary actions and employ powers granted by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to carry out the order. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to determine if circumstances no longer warrant the blocking of the property and interests in property of listed individuals and entities. The order also requires recurring and final reports to be submitted to Congress on the national emergency declared in the order. It clarifies that the order does not create any right or benefit enforceable at law or in equity against the United States or any other person. The order went into effect on February 25, 2011. The annex of the order lists the names of individuals, including members of Qadhafi's family, whose property and interests in property are blocked by the order.
