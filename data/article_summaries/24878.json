In this statement, the President reflects on the five-year anniversary of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crime Prevention Act. He highlights that the law has strengthened protections against crimes based on factors such as race, love, faith, and place of birth. The law has provided the Justice Department with new tools for prosecuting criminals and has directed resources to law enforcement agencies. The President emphasizes that the law reflects and strengthens core national values by recognizing violent bigotry as a dangerous crime that threatens the social fabric of the country. Since the law's passage, the FBI and Department of Justice have investigated and prosecuted numerous hate crime cases, leading to an increase in the number of individuals charged with hate crimes. The law has also resulted in training for law enforcement officers and community members to recognize and address hate crimes. The President concludes by urging continued unity against intolerance and hate, emphasizing the country's commitment to equality for all and the need to treat everyone with respect and dignity.
