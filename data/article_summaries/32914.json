President Donald J. Trump's 2018 National Agriculture Day Proclamation highlights the essential role of agriculture in American society. One in 12 jobs in the United States is dependent on agriculture, and the fruits of U.S. agriculture reach every American. National Agriculture Day, or "Ag Day," is a moment to reflect on how food and fiber products are produced and their contributions to the economy. The Trump administration, through the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity, is considering legislative, regulatory, and policy changes to support farmers. President Trump has also focused on advancing the agriculture sector through executive orders and tax reforms that address the needs of rural America. The administration recognizes the importance of American agriculture and its role in the nation's future.
