The White House has released a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Tribal Playbook to help Tribal governments access the benefits of the historic investments in the nation's infrastructure. The playbook provides information on the specific Tribal funding available under the law, including the more than $13 billion set aside for Indian Country. The Biden-Harris Administration aims to provide affordable high-speed internet, safer roads and bridges, modern wastewater and sanitation systems, clean drinking water, reliable and affordable electricity, and good-paying jobs in every Tribal community. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law appropriates $3.5 billion to the Indian Health Service for drinking water infrastructure and disease prevention in Tribal communities. The Environmental Protection Agency will also provide $154 million to Tribes for water projects. The Departments of Transportation and Energy will release funding for Tribal infrastructure, including road safety and power for unelectrified buildings. The Biden-Harris Administration has already allocated over $110 billion to states, Tribes, territories, and communities for various infrastructure projects.
