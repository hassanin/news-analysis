National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan recently hosted Israeli National Security Advisor Dr. Eyal Hulata and a senior Israeli delegation at the White House. The meeting, called the U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative Group, involved discussions on pressing challenges in the region and a shared determination to address threats facing Israel and its regional partners. Sullivan emphasized President Biden's commitment to Israel's security and preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The administration believes diplomacy is the preferred approach, but is prepared to consider other options if diplomacy fails. The National Security Advisors agreed to maintain an open and constructive dialogue and increase coordination between their respective teams on issues impacting Israel's national security and regional stability.
