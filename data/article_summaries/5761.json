President Biden has declared a state of emergency in North Carolina due to the impact of Hurricane Ian. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local response efforts. The Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will coordinate disaster relief efforts to alleviate hardship and suffering caused by the emergency. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources to mitigate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures and direct federal assistance will be provided at 75% federal funding. John F. Boyle has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
