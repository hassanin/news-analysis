On September 17, 2009, President Barack Obama announced that Staff Sergeant Jared C. Monti of the U.S. Army would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions in combat in Afghanistan. Monti displayed immense courage and sacrificed his own life in an effort to save his comrade. His parents, Paul and Janet Monti, were invited to the White House to commemorate their son's selfless service and sacrifice. Monti was born on September 20, 1975, in Raynham, Massachusetts, and enlisted in the Army in March 1993. He had received several military decorations, including the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and Army Commendation Medals. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who demonstrate exceptional bravery or self-sacrifice in the face of danger.
