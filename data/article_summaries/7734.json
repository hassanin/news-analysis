On October 21, 1995, the President of the United States declared a national emergency due to the threat posed by significant narcotics traffickers in Colombia. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The actions of these traffickers were seen as a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States, as they caused violence, corruption, and harm both within the country and abroad. The national emergency declared in 1995 is set to continue beyond October 21, 2021, as the threat from these traffickers persists. This continuation is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
