The Obama Administration has announced the Climate Action Champions competition, which aims to recognize and invest in local and tribal governments that are taking action to cut carbon pollution and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. The competition, administered by the U.S. Department of Energy, will focus on both mitigation of greenhouse gas pollution and building resilience to climate impacts. The designated Champions will receive technical assistance and preferred status in certain federal grant programs. They will also have the opportunity to engage in peer-to-peer learning with other communities and showcase their efforts on a national stage. The competition will provide support in the form of climate data and tools, access to a peer network, emergency response exercises, access to renewable energy experts, and technical assistance and coaching. The first round of the competition is open to communities that are already leaders in addressing and preparing for climate change, while the next round will focus on communities that have shown a strong commitment but lack the resources for substantial investments. The competition aims to create a model for future Champions to follow and is part of the Presidentâ€™s Climate Action Plan.
