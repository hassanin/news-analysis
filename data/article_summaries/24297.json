First Lady Michelle Obama will be joined by Sesame Street characters Elmo and Rosita, the Produce Marketing Association, and the Partnership for a Healthier America for an announcement about marketing healthier foods to children. This announcement follows a White House convening on food marketing to children, where Mrs. Obama called for promoting healthy products and reducing the marketing of unhealthy products to kids. After the announcement, Mrs. Obama, Elmo, and Rosita will join school children for the fall harvest of the White House Kitchen Garden. The First Lady has invited children from schools in Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia that are offering healthy snack options. All schools will be required to follow the "Smart Snacks in School" nutrition standards starting next school year. Additionally, children from Harriet Tubman Elementary and Bancroft Elementary in Washington DC, who regularly help in the White House Kitchen Garden, will also be present. The article highlights three schools that are involved in promoting healthy eating and incorporating gardens into their curriculum: Magnolia Elementary School in Joppa, MD, Linwood Holton Elementary School in Richmond, VA, and North Elementary School in Morgantown, WV. These schools have made efforts to improve school meals, engage students in gardening, and incorporate fresh produce into their meals.
