The goal of the commission is to promote free and honest federal elections and strengthen the American people's confidence in the electoral system. The commission will investigate issues such as voter fraud, inaccurate voter registration lists, and outdated voting machines. The members of the commission will work together to gather data and facts, and will make recommendations to improve the integrity of the electoral system. The commission aims to conduct its work with transparency and will provide the American people with a report on its findings.
