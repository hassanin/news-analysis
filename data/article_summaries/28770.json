President Trump's Executive Order on Economic Mobility aims to take the first steps towards welfare reform in America. Despite near-record low unemployment rates, welfare enrollment for able-bodied adults is at a record high. Businesses across the country are facing labor shortages and struggling to find enough workers to fill quality jobs. In 2016, over 16 million able-bodied adults were enrolled in SNAP, and as of January 2018, over 74 million Americans were enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP. There are currently a record 28 million able-bodied adults on Medicaid. Adding or enforcing work requirements for able-bodied adults on welfare is seen as an effective solution to help individuals regain their independence. States that have implemented work requirements have seen positive results in improving the lives of thousands of individuals and families.
