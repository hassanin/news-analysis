President Barack Obama has proclaimed November 2016 as National Family Caregivers Month. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of caregivers and pledges support for them. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has improved care and access for older Americans, and expanded options for home- and community-based services. States and local agencies also provide support groups and respite care for caregivers. The administration is committed to improving care and support for veterans and their families. President Obama encourages Americans to pay tribute to those who provide care for their loved ones.
