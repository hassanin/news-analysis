Vice President Kamala Harris visited Baby2Baby in Los Angeles to highlight the need for support for new parents, particularly in addressing the issue of access to diapers. She emphasized that one in three families in need of diapers do not have them, which not only affects the basic needs of the baby but also causes stress and emotional harm to the parents. Harris praised the work of Baby2Baby and its efforts to provide essential items for families, including those affected by natural disasters. The Vice President announced that the federal government, through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), will partner with Baby2Baby to pilot a program in Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Louisiana to meet the needs of parents in those states. She also highlighted the importance of public-private partnerships in addressing the needs of families. In response to a question, Harris explained that the selected states have a high level of need, particularly in areas with limited access to maternal healthcare. Regarding the debt ceiling negotiations, Harris acknowledged that there are differences but expressed confidence in the negotiating team's commitment to reaching an agreement, emphasizing that a default is not an option for the country.
