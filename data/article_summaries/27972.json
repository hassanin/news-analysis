President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring May 16 to May 22, 2020, as National Safe Boating Week. The proclamation aims to raise awareness about safe boating practices and encourage Americans to take necessary precautions while enjoying water activities. The United States Coast Guard and its partners recommend proper preparation, including vessel safety checks and boating courses, to reduce accidents. Wearing life jackets and avoiding alcohol while operating a boat are also emphasized. The proclamation calls upon Americans to prioritize boating safety and participate in educational opportunities. The President urges state and local officials to support boating safety through events aligned with the White House's guidelines for reopening America.
