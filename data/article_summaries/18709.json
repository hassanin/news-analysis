President Obama has declared a major disaster in North Carolina due to the effects of Hurricane Matthew. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Assistance will be available to individuals and businesses in certain counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and other recovery programs. Federal funding will also be available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will oversee federal recovery operations, and residents and business owners can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. Damage assessments are still ongoing, and additional assistance may be designated as needed.
