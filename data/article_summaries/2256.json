The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached an agreement known as the Windsor Framework, which aims to preserve and strengthen the peace and progress of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. The agreement ensures that Northern Ireland remains a part of both the UK's internal market and the EU's single market. The United States supports this agreement and is ready to help Northern Ireland take advantage of the economic opportunities it brings. Joe Kennedy, the new Special Envoy to Northern Ireland for Economic Affairs, will work closely with Ambassador Jane Hartley in London and Ambassador Claire Cronin in Dublin, as well as business leaders in Northern Ireland. The hope is that Northern Ireland's political institutions will soon be operational again, as they are a key part of the Good Friday Agreement. As Northern Ireland approaches the 25th anniversary of the Agreement in April, it is important to remember the hard work and determination that went into ending decades of conflict. The United States is proud of its role in achieving and preserving peace in Northern Ireland and looks forward to continuing to work with all partners involved.
