During the G20 Summit, President Biden announced a historic agreement for a new India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor. This corridor will involve investments in ships and rail that will connect India to Europe through the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Israel. The goal is to facilitate trade, export clean energy, expand access to reliable clean electricity, and improve internet connectivity. Additionally, the United States is working on a Trans-African Corridor in partnership with the European Union, which will involve investments in a new rail line connecting Angola, the DRC, Zambia, and the Indian Ocean. These projects aim to create jobs, boost trade, strengthen supply chains, and enhance connectivity in multiple countries. President Biden also mentioned other infrastructure investments, including a solar energy site, an insulin manufacturing facility, and an electricity project in India. The United States is committed to mobilizing trillions of dollars in investment to close infrastructure gaps globally. President Biden emphasized the importance of investing in low- and middle-income countries and emerging economies for the benefit of all.
