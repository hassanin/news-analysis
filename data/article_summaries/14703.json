Vice President Biden and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that all 55 U.S. states and territories have obligated half of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) highways funding ahead of schedule. $19 billion has been allocated to fund over 5,300 approved transportation projects, with 1,900 already underway. The states successfully beat the deadline of obligating 50% of their highway funds by June 29, 2009, at least 10 days in advance. The projects funded by the ARRA are creating jobs and contributing to the country's long-term economic strength. Transportation projects are coming in under budget and ahead of schedule, allowing states to stretch taxpayer dollars and create more jobs. ARRA funding for highway projects can be used for restoration, repair, construction, and other activities. Priority is given to projects that will be completed within three years, are in economically distressed areas, or will maximize job creation and economic benefits.
