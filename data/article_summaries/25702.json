President Donald Trump has amended Proclamation 9496, which established the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, by lifting the prohibition on commercial fishing within the monument's boundaries. The President states that appropriately managed commercial fishing would not put the objects of scientific and historic interest that the monument protects at risk. The proclamation also acknowledges the importance of fishing to the New England region and the connection to the health of the ocean. The fish species identified in Proclamation 9496 are subject to existing federal protections and management under laws such as the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Other laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, provide specific protections for plant and animal resources within and outside the monument. The amendment does not modify the management or protection of the monument in any other respect.
