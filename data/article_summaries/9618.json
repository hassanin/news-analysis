This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama, designates officers of the National Archives and Records Administration to act as Archivist of the United States in the event that both the Archivist and the Deputy Archivist are unable to perform their duties. The designated officials, in order of succession, include the Chief Operating Officer, Chief of Management and Administration, Executive for Agency Services, Director of the National Personnel Records Center, and Director of the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum. The memorandum also includes exceptions and limitations, stating that individuals serving in an acting capacity cannot act as Archivist, and the President retains the discretion to depart from this memorandum in designating an acting Archivist. The memorandum revokes a previous memorandum issued in 2012, and it does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits. The memorandum is authorized to be published in the Federal Register.
