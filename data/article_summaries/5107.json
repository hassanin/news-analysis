The United States has taken significant actions to disrupt the trafficking of synthetic drugs, particularly illicit fentanyl. The Department of Justice has announced criminal charges against over two dozen individuals involved in the production and proliferation of illicit fentanyl worldwide. This is one of the largest groupings of fentanyl-related criminal charges ever brought. The Department of Treasury has also imposed sanctions on two companies and five individuals linked to the global distribution of precursor chemicals used in the synthesis of illicit fentanyl. The Department of State has submitted over two dozen individuals to its Narcotics Rewards Program, offering rewards for information leading to the arrest or conviction of narcotics traffickers. These actions are part of ongoing efforts to combat fentanyl trafficking globally and collaborate with key partners like Mexico. The US government considers the illicit drug trade as a threat to public health, safety, national security, and the economy. The Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Treasury, and Department of State are commended for their commitment to justice and keeping Americans safe.
