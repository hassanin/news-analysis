President Donald J. Trump awarded the Medal of Honor to former Specialist Five James C. McCloughan for his actions during the Vietnam War. McCloughan risked his life on nine separate occasions to rescue wounded comrades and refused medical evacuation to stay with his unit. After the war, McCloughan spent nearly 40 years teaching and coaching sports at South Haven High School in Michigan. The Medal of Honor is awarded to individuals who demonstrate gallantry above and beyond the call of duty in military operations. This is the first Medal of Honor President Trump has awarded.
