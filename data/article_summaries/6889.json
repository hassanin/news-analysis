The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded contracts for the sale of 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. These barrels will be delivered in May and June, and it is the largest release of reserves in history. The release aims to address supply disruptions caused by Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the price hike at the pump. The initial sale received strong interest, with bids for a total of 76 million barrels. Additionally, the Biden Administration announced actions and programs to accelerate America's move towards energy independence and lower costs with a clean energy economy. These include the largest-ever release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a historic collective release from the International Energy Agency, expanding access to affordable fuel options, and increasing domestic production. The administration emphasizes the importance of clean energy, affordability, accessibility, and energy efficiency in achieving true energy independence and lowering costs for families.
