Senior White House officials and over 20 law enforcement leaders from across the country met to discuss building support for an assault weapons and high-capacity magazine ban, as well as other legislation to reduce gun violence. The meeting was organized in response to President Biden's op-ed in May 2023, where he outlined a plan to enact further gun safety measures. The law enforcement leaders highlighted the challenges they face in dealing with criminals armed with assault weapons and expressed the need for urgent action to reduce gun violence. The officials emphasized the importance of mobilizing law enforcement voices to support these measures and improve community safety. The participants agreed on the urgency of forming a broad coalition and an action plan based on input from law enforcement. The goal is to work together to pass additional gun safety legislation.
