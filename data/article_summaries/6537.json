The Biden-Harris Administration met with the House and Senate Bipartisan Task Forces for Combating Antisemitism to discuss the rise of antisemitism in the United States. President Biden has established the Interagency Policy Committee to Counter Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and Related Forms of Discrimination and Bias, which is tasked with developing a national strategy to counter antisemitism. The meeting focused on the urgent need for this strategy, the ongoing process of developing it, and plans for implementation. The discussion also emphasized the importance of increasing awareness and understanding of antisemitism, protecting Jewish individuals and institutions, reversing the normalization of antisemitism and violence against Jews, and building allyship across communities to counter antisemitism and other forms of hate. Members of Congress provided feedback and insights based on their own efforts to combat antisemitism.
