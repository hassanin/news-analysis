The White House Press Secretary has issued a statement expressing concern over Senate Republicans' lack of action in preventing student loan interest rates from doubling on July 1. The statement criticizes the Republicans for choosing to ask students to pay an average of $1,000 each instead of closing a loophole that benefits the wealthy. The Press Secretary emphasizes the urgency of the situation and calls for a resolution to ensure that students have access to affordable education.
