Today, White House officials, including Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, White House Counsel Dana Remus, and Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Julie Rodriguez, hosted a virtual meeting with attorneys general from seven states and the District of Columbia. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss policies and strategies for holding gun manufacturers and dealers accountable for their role in supplying firearms used in gun crimes.

This meeting is part of President Biden's comprehensive plan to reduce gun crimes, which includes supporting local law enforcement, investing in community violence interruption efforts, and addressing the flow of guns used in crimes. One of the key topics of discussion was the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a law that provides immunity to gun dealers and manufacturers from certain liability for their products. The attorneys general highlighted how PLCAA has hindered their ability to hold these entities accountable for wrongful conduct that contributes to shootings and other gun crimes.

President Biden has called for the repeal of PLCAA, comparing it to exemptions granted to tobacco companies that misled the public about the dangers of their products. Despite the current law, the participants discussed ways to hold gun manufacturers and dealers accountable using existing consumer protection and nuisance laws, as well as the possibility of enacting firearm-specific liability laws similar to New York State's recent legislation.

Overall, the meeting aimed to explore both short-term and long-term strategies for addressing gun violence and ensuring public safety.
