First Lady Michelle Obama, along with Epicurious, the Department of Education, and the Department of Agriculture, has announced the winners of the Healthy Lunchtime Challenge. This nationwide recipe challenge is part of the First Lady's Let's Move! initiative, which aims to promote healthy lunches and combat childhood obesity. The winners, representing all U.S. states, three territories, and the District of Columbia, will attend a Kids' "State Dinner" at the White House on July 18. The 54 children will enjoy a healthy lunch featuring a selection of the winning recipes, followed by a visit to the White House Kitchen Garden. The recipes had to adhere to the guidelines of USDA's MyPlate, ensuring that they included each of the food groups, with fruits and vegetables making up roughly half the plate or recipe. The winners were chosen by a panel of judges, and a downloadable e-cookbook of the winning recipes will be available in July. First Lady Michelle Obama expressed her excitement about hosting the winners and showcasing the healthy creations of talented kid chefs from across the country. Epicurious, the originator of the challenge, is proud to work with Mrs. Obama on raising awareness about healthy eating. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack praised the initiative for helping kids build healthy habits and encouraging other children to eat healthier.
