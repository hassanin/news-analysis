In November, the United States acknowledges the challenges faced by individuals with Alzheimer's disease and pledges support for their caregivers. Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the country, affecting memory and daily tasks. The friends and family of those living with the disease dedicate time and resources to improve their loved ones' quality of life. The Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, signed into law in 2018, aims to enhance public health infrastructure, raise awareness, and support research for early detection, diagnosis, and care plans. National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month serves as a reminder of love and support for those affected and honors the healthcare professionals who aid and comfort them. The goal is to find a cure and alleviate the suffering of the millions diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
