President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566 with respect to Libya will continue beyond February 25, 2019. The ongoing instability in Libya, caused by actions taken by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his associates in 2011, poses a significant threat of civil conflict. There is a risk that Libyan state assets could be misappropriated by individuals seeking to undermine the United Nations peace process, including former members of the Qadhafi government and his close associates. This could prolong and deepen the current instability in Libya, benefiting terrorist groups such as ISIS. The President believes that the situation in Libya still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and therefore, it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to Libya.
