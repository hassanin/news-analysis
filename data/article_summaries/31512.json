According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, America added nearly 1.4 million new jobs in August, and the unemployment rate fell by 1.8 percentage points to 8.4 percent, indicating a strong recovery. The unemployment rate had reached a peak of 14.7 percent in April due to the impact of COVID-19, but it has since fallen by 6.3 percentage points in just four months. This is a faster labor market recovery than what was seen after the Great Recession in 2008-09. The report also highlights the progress made since April, with the number of temporary layoffs decreasing from over 18 million to 6 million. The recovery has been particularly positive for low-income and minority workers, with employment increasing for Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and women. Those without a high school diploma saw a decrease in unemployment, while those with only a high school diploma also experienced a slight decrease. Overall, the report suggests that the economic comeback is underway and gaining momentum.
