President of the United States announced that a successful airstrike was conducted in Kabul, Afghanistan, resulting in the death of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the emir of al Qaeda.

The President emphasized that the United States will continue to defend its people against threats and will take action against those who seek to harm the country. The operation to eliminate al-Zawahiri was carefully planned to minimize the risk to civilians, and no civilian casualties occurred. The President also highlighted that the United States will remain vigilant in monitoring and addressing threats from al Qaeda. The announcement was made to provide closure to the families who lost loved ones in the 9/11 attacks and to honor their memories. The President expressed gratitude to the intelligence and counterterrorism communities for their dedication and efforts in keeping the country safe. He reiterated the commitment to protecting the nation and its people.
