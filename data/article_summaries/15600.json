The Obama Administration has proposed new fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks for Model Year 2017-2025. The goal is to reduce dependence on oil, save consumers money at the pump, and curb pollution. The proposed standards would save Americans over $1.7 trillion in fuel costs and reduce oil consumption by 12 billion barrels. It is estimated that the standards would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion metric tons. The proposed program would require increases in fuel efficiency equivalent to 54.5 mpg and would save consumers an average of up to $6,600 in fuel costs over the lifetime of a MY 2025 vehicle. The proposal builds on the success of the first phase of the Obama Administrationâ€™s national program (2012-2016) and aims to have model year 2025 vehicles with nearly double the fuel economy of model year 2010 vehicles. The proposed standards provide regulatory certainty and flexibility for auto manufacturers while reducing oil consumption and air pollution. The proposal includes incentives for the adoption of advanced technologies, such as hybridization for pickup trucks. The public will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal for 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register.
