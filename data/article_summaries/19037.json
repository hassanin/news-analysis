Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan visited Jackson Middle School in Orlando to highlight the success of the Recovery Act in Florida. The Recovery Act has saved tens of thousands of teaching jobs and provided resources for preparing American students for the 21st-century economy. Florida has received over $3.1 billion in education funds, including $2 billion for state stabilization, $335 million for special education, and $245 million for Title I schools. Orange County Public Schools has preserved over 1600 teachers and staff due to $132 million from the Recovery Act. The Recovery Act has also impacted other aspects of Floridians' lives, including tax relief, transportation, and job creation. Overall, the Recovery Act has committed $250 billion in six months, with over $53 billion in tax cuts. It is also making long-term commitments to America's economy, investing in high-speed rail, broadband, and smart-grid.
