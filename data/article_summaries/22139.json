The article discusses the United States' commitment to the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), a global initiative aimed at preventing, detecting, and responding to epidemic threats. The GHSA involves 55 countries, NGOs, foundations, and private sector stakeholders, and was launched in 2014 by the United States and its partners. Since its launch, the GHSA has led to historic commitments and progress in establishing global capacity to address outbreaks. Under President Obama's leadership, the United States has played a major role in advancing the GHSA, providing assistance to 17 at-risk countries, developing 5-year plans with common targets and milestones, and undergoing external evaluations to assess preparedness. The United States is also investing in innovative solutions through USAID's Combatting Zika and Future Threats Grand Challenge. However, there is still work to be done, and all countries must play a role in their own preparedness. The article emphasizes the importance of collaboration and cooperation across sectors and at the highest levels of government to achieve a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats.
