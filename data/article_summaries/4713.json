President Biden visited the National Institutes of Health to discuss his administration's efforts to lower prescription drug costs and crack down on price-gouging. He emphasized the need to put money back in the pockets of hardworking families and reduce government spending on prescription drugs. The President highlighted the high cost of drugs in the United States compared to other countries, and the negative impact it has on Americans, including seniors who skip doses or cannot afford their medications. He discussed the Inflation Reduction Act, which allows Medicare to recoup the difference if drug prices rise faster than inflation. The President also emphasized the importance of giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices, similar to the Department of Veterans Affairs. He announced that fair-pricing clauses will be included in contracts for public health emergency response, ensuring that Americans pay the same prices as people in other countries for vaccines and treatments. Additionally, the President mentioned other steps taken to promote competition in healthcare and lower costs, including cracking down on anticompetitive practices and surprise billing. He criticized Republicans for opposing the legislation that has resulted in drug savings and warned against repealing the laws and allowing Big Pharma to charge exorbitant prices again. President Biden reiterated his commitment to lowering prescription drug costs, expanding healthcare coverage, and building an economy where healthcare is a right, not a privilege. He concluded by expressing his confidence in the United States' capacity to achieve these goals.
