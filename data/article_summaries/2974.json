On America Recycles Day, President Biden promotes the benefits of recycling for health, the environment, and the economy. The goal is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, create new jobs, and address the climate crisis by manufacturing recyclable products, reducing waste, and reusing resources. However, recycling is facing challenges in many parts of the country, including uncertainty about what materials can be recycled and difficulties finding markets for recycled waste. The extraction and processing of natural resources instead of reusing materials also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Communities of color and low-income Americans, who often live near landfills and waste processing plants, suffer disproportionately from pollution's damaging effects on their health and livelihoods. In response, the Biden Administration has released a National Recycling Strategy to educate Americans about best practices. The strategy aims to improve collection methods, identify markets for recyclable materials, and fund recycling technologies. It also encourages investments in recycling technologies and supports efforts to address climate change. The Federal Government aims to lead by example, but individual actions are crucial. Americans are encouraged to dispose of waste properly, reuse containers, compost food, and use products made with recycled materials. Manufacturers and corporations are also urged to improve reusability and recyclability and reduce non-recyclable packaging. The collective efforts of individuals, businesses, and the government can create a cleaner and greener country for future generations. President Biden proclaims November 15, 2022, as America Recycles Day and calls upon Americans to observe the day and continue their recycling efforts throughout the year.
