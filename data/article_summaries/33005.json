Antibiotics are important for treating certain infections caused by bacteria and fungi, but they should be prescribed properly and not for viral illnesses like the common cold or influenza. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 30% of outpatient antibiotics are unnecessarily prescribed each year. Overprescribing antibiotics can have harmful side effects and lead to antibiotic resistance, where bacteria become resistant to the drugs. The CDC recently reported that at least 2.8 million people in the United States are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria or fungi each year, resulting in over 35,000 deaths. To combat this issue, the CDC's Be Antibiotics Aware initiative provides resources to educate the public and healthcare professionals on when antibiotics are necessary, how to optimize their prescription, and how to combat antibiotic resistance. The administration is also implementing the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. It is important to improve antibiotic stewardship at home and in medical settings to address the rising concerns about overprescription and antibiotic resistance.
