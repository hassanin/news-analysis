Belgium, a leader in nuclear technology development, has announced at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit that it will collaborate with the United States to eliminate its excess highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium. The removal of this material will be completed in connection with the Nuclear Security Summit in 2014. The specifics of the material quantities and locations are considered sensitive information and cannot be shared at this time. Belgium, despite being a non-weapons state, has retained a leading nuclear technology research center and derives over 50% of its energy from nuclear power using 7 power reactors.
