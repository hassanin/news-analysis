The article discusses the potential consequences of proposed cuts to critical support systems for hardworking families. The White House released fact sheets highlighting the negative impacts of these cuts, which include endangering public safety, worsening public health, increasing costs for families and students, and harming seniors and veterans. The article criticizes House Republicans for pushing for these cuts while also advocating for massive tax breaks for the super wealthy and big corporations. In contrast, President Biden's Budget aims to invest in America, lower costs for families, protect Medicare and Social Security, and reduce the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over 10 years without increasing taxes for those making less than $400,000 per year. The analysis assumes an across-the-board reduction of approximately 22% compared to current levels for non-defense discretionary accounts.
