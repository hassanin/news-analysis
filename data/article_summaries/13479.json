The statement by General James L. Jones, the National Security Advisor, discusses the United States' support for the agreements reached at the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference. These agreements aim to strengthen the global non-proliferation regime and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The document includes steps to advance nuclear disarmament, nonproliferation, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It also calls for measures to strengthen inspections and compliance with the treaty to address countries like Iran that are seeking nuclear weapons in violation of their international obligations. However, the United States has reservations about one aspect of the Middle East resolution included in the document. While the US supports the idea of a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), it believes that a comprehensive peace in the region and full compliance with arms control and nonproliferation obligations are necessary prerequisites for establishing such a zone. The US suggests that a regional conference be held in 2012 to discuss this issue, including regional security, verification and compliance, and all categories of WMD. The US emphasizes that the conference must include all countries in the Middle East and other relevant countries and should be focused on an exchange of views rather than setting unrealistic expectations or singling out Israel. The US expresses disappointment that the NPT document singled out Israel while failing to mention Iran, which is seen as the greatest threat to nuclear proliferation in the region. The US will ensure the conference only takes place if all countries feel confident that it can operate in an unbiased and constructive way.
