Idaho has become the first state to adopt a law similar to Texas' SB8, which restricts abortions after six weeks and relies on private citizens to enforce it. This development is concerning for women in Idaho, particularly those with low incomes and living in rural communities, as it will further hinder their access to healthcare. Texas' SB8 has already had negative effects, such as women having to travel long distances to access care and neighboring states' clinics experiencing a surge in demand. President Biden has directed a government response to protect women's rights, emphasizing the administration's support for women's healthcare decisions and calling on Congress to pass a bill to counter these restrictive measures.
