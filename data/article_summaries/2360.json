The United States and United Kingdom are committing to intensify their cooperation to support international energy security, affordability, and sustainability amidst the global energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They aim to reduce dependence on Russian energy in Europe and stabilize energy markets. Their immediate goal is to ensure short-term security of supply while working towards achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To facilitate this, they are establishing a Joint Action Group for Energy Security and Affordability, which will focus on energy efficiency, innovative energy solutions, gas supply, nuclear cooperation, and international collaboration on clean energy. The group will be convened by representatives from the offices of the President and Prime Minister and will enhance commercial and scientific ties between the two countries. This initiative will complement the existing Strategic Energy Dialogue.
