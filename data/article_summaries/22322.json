In this press gaggle, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest announces that the United States Trade Representative is filing a World Trade Organization (WTO) enforcement action against China for illegally subsidizing their auto and auto parts sectors. This action is a result of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center's success in presenting well researched and thoroughly investigated cases before the WTO. The announcement is particularly significant in Ohio, where the auto parts sector employs more than 54,000 people and the auto industry as a whole supports 850,000 jobs. The President believes in advocating for American workers and ensuring a fair and level playing field. The press also asks about the timing of the announcement and the ongoing teachers' strike in Chicago. On the topic of Iran's nuclear program, the administration believes that if Iran were to pursue a nuclear weapon, it would take about a year for them to develop one. The United States and Israel are united in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and the President continues to pursue diplomatic efforts while keeping all options on the table. The press also asks about the President's monitoring of the situation in Afghanistan and the recent SNL impression of him, but there are no significant updates provided.
