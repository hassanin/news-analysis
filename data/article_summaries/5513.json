President Biden and senior administration officials held the "Communities in Action: Building a Better Pennsylvania" event, where they spoke with elected officials and community leaders from across Pennsylvania. The event, hosted by the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Office of Public Engagement, featured discussions on the impact of the Biden economic plan, including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act. These initiatives aim to create jobs, bring manufacturing back to America, and lower costs for Pennsylvania families. The administration also emphasized its commitment to partnering with states, local governments, labor leaders, businesses, non-profits, and healthcare leaders to leverage these investments and create opportunities for working families in Pennsylvania. This event is part of a series of "Communities in Action" events hosted by the White House to showcase the administration's efforts in delivering results for the American people.
