Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to congratulate him on the formation of a new government and discuss Ukraine's financial and energy situation. The United States will continue to work with European and other partners to provide Ukraine with the necessary financing to stabilize its economy and implement reforms. The two leaders also talked about Ukraine's energy security and the Vice President pledged ongoing technical support from the US. They discussed the issue of Russia and its proxies blocking humanitarian aid from entering eastern Ukraine, as well as the lawless environment created by Russia's actions where separatists are stealing social benefits payments from pensioners and citizens. The Vice President commended Ukraine's plan to keep these payments in escrow until they can be safely and directly disbursed.
