President Joe Biden has announced that former U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd and former U.S. Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell will serve as special advisors for the Ninth Summit of the Americas, which will take place in Los Angeles from June 6 to June 10. Senator Dodd has extensive experience in Latin American affairs, having served as Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere for over three decades. He also volunteered in the Dominican Republic as part of President John Kennedy's Peace Corps in the 1960s. Congresswoman Mucarsel-Powell, the first and only Latina Democrat to represent a Congressional district in Florida, has been a strong advocate for supporting Venezuelans fleeing their country and has sponsored environmental and public health legislation. Both advisors are confident that President Biden will strengthen collaboration and respect among the Americas at the upcoming summit, which will focus on building a sustainable, resilient, and equitable future for the region.
