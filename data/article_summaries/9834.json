Top administration officials, including Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson, met with BP CEO Tony Hayward and BP American Chairman and President Lamar McKay to discuss ongoing response efforts and receive an update on BP's spill mitigation plans for potentially affected Gulf Coast states. The meeting was part of a series of coordination and communication activities between the administration and BP leadership. The administration has launched a coordinated response to mitigate the spill's impact on public health, the environment, and the economy. BP is now accepting claims for the Gulf Coast oil spill, and information on how to file claims is available. The Obama administration has made it clear that BP will be held accountable for the costs associated with the spill.
