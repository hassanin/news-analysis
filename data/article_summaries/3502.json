One year ago, President Biden introduced his Build Back Better Agenda to address the challenges the country was facing, including the pandemic, economic downturn, climate crisis, and racial injustices. The agenda includes the American Families Plan and key elements of the American Jobs Plan. It aims to create jobs, cut taxes, and lower costs for working families. The agenda includes measures to lower prescription drug costs, child care costs, health care costs, and higher education costs. It also aims to lower housing costs and provide tax cuts for families with children and workers without children. The agenda emphasizes locally-led economic development, workforce training, clean energy jobs, and investments in teachers and schools.
