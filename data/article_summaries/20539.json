President Obama has announced new actions to spur innovation and entrepreneurship in American manufacturing. The manufacturing sector has been growing, with 646,000 jobs added since February 2010, the fastest pace of job growth since the 1990s. New technologies and entrepreneurship in manufacturing are providing advantages for the United States and helping Americans get ahead. The Obama Administration is taking steps to support manufacturing entrepreneurship, such as expanding access to advanced equipment in federal R&D facilities, investing in research for advanced materials, and supporting the Materials Genome Initiative. Mayors and local leaders around the country are also investing in manufacturing and supporting the Maker movement. These actions aim to revitalize the U.S. manufacturing sector and strengthen American innovation.
