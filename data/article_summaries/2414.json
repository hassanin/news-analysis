President Joe Biden has announced two additional members of his energy and jobs team: David Turk as Deputy Secretary of Energy and Julie Su as Deputy Secretary of Labor. Turk, currently the Deputy Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, has focused on helping countries with their clean energy transitions and has experience in coordinating international technology and clean energy efforts. Su, the current Secretary of the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency, is a nationally recognized expert on workers' and civil rights. She has enforced labor laws in California and has brought landmark lawsuits to protect low-wage workers and immigrant victims of crime and human trafficking. Both Turk and Su will support the efforts of Secretary of Energy Nominee Jennifer Granholm and Secretary of Labor Nominee Marty Walsh in addressing the energy and jobs crisis and advancing President Biden's Build Back Better agenda.
