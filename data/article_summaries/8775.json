The ongoing fighting in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces is causing a tragic loss of life and must be stopped. Despite a ceasefire agreement, violence continues across the country, hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid and causing suffering. The bloodshed in Khartoum and Darfur is particularly alarming. The failure of the security forces to abide by the ceasefire raises concerns about a prolonged conflict and widespread suffering. The United States is taking action to prevent this, including issuing economic sanctions, imposing visa restrictions, and releasing an updated Business Advisory on Sudan. The United States stands with the Sudanese people, supporting their demand for a transition to democracy, and will hold those responsible for the violence accountable.
