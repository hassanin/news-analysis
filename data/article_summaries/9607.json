In this presidential memorandum, President Barack Obama establishes the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, led by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality. The goals of the initiative are to reconnect Americans, especially children, to the outdoors, conserve land and water resources, and use science-based management practices to protect the environment. The initiative will conduct listening and learning sessions around the country and work with various government agencies to align policies and programs. The initiative will submit reports to the President, including a review of nonfederal conservation approaches, analysis of existing federal resources, and proposed strategies and activities. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of public-private partnerships and leveraging resources to achieve conservation goals.
