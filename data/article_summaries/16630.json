The White House hosted Presidents Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala, Juan Orlando Hernandez of Honduras, and Salvador Sanchez Ceren of El Salvador to discuss cooperation in disrupting smuggling organizations and promoting safe migration. They discussed accelerating development, economic growth, and security improvements in the region to address the factors causing citizens to undertake dangerous journeys to the United States. The administration remains concerned about the numbers of unaccompanied children crossing into the United States and prioritizes their safety, housing, and medical treatment. The enforcement of immigration laws is also emphasized, with a focus on repatriating those who have recently crossed the border. The governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have coordinated closely with the United States to respond to irregular migration. The United States is providing additional resources to support repatriation efforts and expand services for returned migrants. The United States recognizes the challenges faced by these countries, including high levels of violent crime, poverty, and lack of opportunities, and is committed to promoting a prosperous, democratic, and secure Central America. They provide ongoing bilateral assistance and are working to increase support with a $300 million foreign assistance request to Congress. Collaboration with Central American governments, civil society, and the private sector is essential in addressing the challenges facing the region.
