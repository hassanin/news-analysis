In this letter, President Barack Obama informs the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate about an alternative plan for pay increases for civilian federal employees for the year 2013. He explains that due to a "national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare," he has the authority to implement alternative pay plans. Despite the sacrifices made by federal employees during a two-year pay freeze, the President believes it is necessary to maintain efforts towards fiscal sustainability. As a result, he has determined that for 2013, across-the-board pay increases will be 0.5 percent, and the current locality pay percentages will remain at their 2012 levels. The President assures that this decision will not significantly impact the government's ability to attract and retain a qualified federal workforce. Additionally, he requests that Congress maintains current pay rates during the period of the anticipated continuing resolution, with the adjustments taking effect after the resolution expires.
