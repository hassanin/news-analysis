Secretary of State John Kerry and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy will be leading the U.S. delegation to the upcoming Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in Kigali, Rwanda. The Montreal Protocol is a global agreement aimed at protecting the ozone layer by regulating the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. This meeting will focus on discussing an amendment to the Protocol that addresses the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are potent greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. The U.S. delegation will include representatives from various government departments, including the White House, Department of State, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Agriculture.
