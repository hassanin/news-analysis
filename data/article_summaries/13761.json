On December 13, 2011, President Barack Obama issued an executive order to amend the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States. This order applies to parts III and IV of the manual and includes an annex with the specific amendments. The amendments will take effect 30 days from the date of the order. It is clarified that these amendments will not retroactively punish any act done or omitted prior to the effective date if it was not punishable at the time. Additionally, the amendments will not invalidate any ongoing nonjudicial punishment proceedings, restraint, investigation, referral of charges, trial, or other actions that were initiated before the effective date. These proceedings will continue as if the amendments had not been prescribed.
