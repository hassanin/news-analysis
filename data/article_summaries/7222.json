The Biden administration's economic agenda, known as Bidenomics, and its Investing in America initiative have attracted significant investments from companies in the Asia-Pacific region. Legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS and Science Act, and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have played a role in encouraging these investments. These investments not only stimulate domestic economic growth but also address the climate crisis, strengthen the U.S. economy, and create well-paying jobs. The recent "Investing in America" event showcased examples of job-creating investments in the United States by Asia-Pacific-based companies, particularly in the clean energy and semiconductor sectors. The U.S. Export-Import Bank also announced a $169 million loan to BETA Technologies, enabling the expansion of its U.S.-based production of electric-powered aircraft and the creation of 400 clean energy jobs. Overall, companies from the Asia-Pacific region have committed nearly $200 billion in investments in the United States since the start of the Biden administration, supporting tens of thousands of new jobs. The SelectUSA program has played a role in facilitating these investments.
