The White House has announced the first-ever fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas pollution standards for heavy-duty trucks, buses, and other vehicles. These standards are expected to save American businesses approximately $50 billion in fuel costs over the life of the program. The Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency developed the standards in collaboration with industry officials and other stakeholders. The program will reduce oil consumption by 530 million barrels and greenhouse gas pollution by 270 million metric tons between 2014 and 2018. The standards will also result in long-term savings for vehicle owners and operators, as well as reduce emissions of harmful air pollutants. The program will benefit consumers and businesses by reducing transportation costs and promoting growth in the clean energy sector.
