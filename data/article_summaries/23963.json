The Obama Administration has made significant progress in addressing substance use disorders, particularly the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic. The President has called for $1.1 billion in new funding for states to expand access to treatment, and Congress is considering legislation to provide $1 billion in new funding for this purpose. The Administration's approach to drug policy is based on scientific research that shows substance use disorder is a chronic disease of the brain that can be prevented, treated, and recovered from. The Affordable Care Act has expanded mental health and substance use disorder coverage to over 60 million people. The CDC issued its first-ever recommendations for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, and medical, nursing, and pharmacy schools have committed to prescriber training. The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health provided an in-depth look at substance use disorders and addiction, recommended actions to prevent and treat these conditions, and called for a cultural shift in how Americans talk about the issue. SAMHSA has increased access to buprenorphine treatment by allowing practitioners to treat up to 275 patients, improving access to medication-assisted treatment.
