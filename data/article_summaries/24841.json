President Obama was briefed by DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate about the preparations for a severe winter storm that is expected to affect over two dozen states. Winter storm watches, warnings, and advisories have been issued in more than 30 states, with blizzard warnings in eight states. Americans are encouraged to follow the instructions of state and local officials and stay updated through local radio or TV stations. FEMA is coordinating closely with state, local, and tribal officials in affected states and has deployed personnel and prepositioned essential items for rapid delivery if needed. The President emphasized the need to be prepared for power outages and for state and federal agencies to support affected communities. While no requests for federal financial assistance have been made yet, the President emphasized the readiness to support impacted states throughout the storm.
