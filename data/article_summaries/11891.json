Vice President Biden announced that the Administration has met or exceeded all ten commitments laid out in the Roadmap to Recovery for the second 100 days of the Recovery Act. The commitments included enabling health centers to provide expanded services to patients, beginning rehabilitation and improvement projects at airports and highways, and starting work on national parks. The Department of Health and Human Services exceeded its goal, providing expanded service to approximately 500,000 patients. The Department of Transportation exceeded its goal, beginning projects at 192 airports and over 2,200 highways. The Department of the Interior exceeded its commitment with work underway at 138 national parks. Cabinet members and other administration officials traveled across the country to highlight the impact of the Roadmap on local communities and the national economy. The Recovery Act, signed into law in February 2009, provides tax relief, financial assistance, and investments in technology and infrastructure to create jobs and improve the economy. Various measures of progress were also highlighted, such as the number of rural residents receiving new or improved water services, research grants awarded by NIH, transportation projects approved, and contracts awarded to small businesses.
