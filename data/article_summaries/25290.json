President Trump announced in a press conference that a deal has been reached to end the government shutdown and reopen the federal government. The deal includes funding for border security and the construction of barriers, fences, or walls along the border. The President thanked federal workers for their dedication and assured them that they will receive back pay. A bipartisan Conference Committee will review requests from Homeland Security experts and law enforcement professionals to create a Homeland Security package. The President emphasized the need for border security to combat drug smuggling, human trafficking, and illegal immigration. He stated that walls are effective in preventing these issues and that the proposed barriers will be made of steel and equipped with advanced technology. The President also called for improvements to drug detection technology and manpower at ports of entry. He highlighted the humanitarian crisis caused by human trafficking and the dangers faced by women and children. The President warned that if a fair deal is not reached, he will consider using his powers to address the border security emergency.
