The United States has announced the imposition of new sanctions against Iran as part of its ongoing efforts to increase the cost of Iran's failure to comply with international obligations regarding its nuclear program. These sanctions have slowed Iran's nuclear program by limiting their access to nuclear technology and information. They have also hindered Iran's access to the international financial system, forcing them to resort to expensive and cumbersome methods for financial transactions. Furthermore, the sanctions have deterred investment in Iran's oil and gas sector, resulting in a $100 billion investment deficit. The United States has also exposed Iran's support for terrorism and imposed sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for terrorism. Additionally, the United States has used its sanctions authorities to impose consequences on those responsible for human rights violations in Iran. The sanctions target Iran's illicit conduct and the mechanisms by which Iran supports these activities. The United States will continue to expose Iranian cover organizations, deceptive business practices, and efforts to evade sanctions as long as Iran's illicit conduct continues.
