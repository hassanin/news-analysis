President Barack Obama has announced that the national emergency declared in 1995 with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia will continue beyond October 21, 2009. The President states that the circumstances that led to the declaration have not been resolved, and the actions of these traffickers continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. In order to maintain economic pressure on these traffickers, the President plans to block their property and interests in the United States and deprive them of access to the U.S. market and financial system.
