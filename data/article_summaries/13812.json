This article is a Presidential Memorandum from May 17, 2012, in which President Barack Obama directs all executive departments and agencies to implement the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). The PREA was enacted in 2003 with bipartisan support and established a "zero tolerance standard" for rape in prisons in the United States. The Attorney General has finalized a rule adopting national standards to prevent, detect, and respond to prison rape. This memorandum states that PREA applies to all federal confinement facilities, including those operated by executive departments and agencies other than the Department of Justice. Each agency is responsible for implementing the laws and rules that govern its own operations and ensuring the safety of persons in its custody. The memorandum directs agencies to propose any necessary rules or procedures to satisfy the requirements of PREA within 120 days and finalize them within 240 days. The memorandum also notes that it is not intended to create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
