President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited Georgia to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Michael. They met with Governor Nathan Deal and other officials to discuss the impact on Georgia's agricultural community. The storm caused extensive damage to crops such as pecans, cotton, and peanuts, leading to significant losses for farmers. The President expressed concern about the "generational" damage to the agriculture industry, particularly the loss of pecan trees that take years to grow and bear fruit. He also acknowledged the role of federal agencies, including FEMA and the American Red Cross, in providing assistance to affected areas. When asked about climate change and its impact on hurricanes, President Trump stated that there is "something there" but did not provide a definitive answer. He also addressed the issue of child separation at the border, stating his intention to change immigration laws, which he described as "the worst and dumbest" in the world.
