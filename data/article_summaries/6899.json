Local news outlets across the country have reported on new state-by-state data regarding the Biden-Harris Administration's plan for student debt relief. The data shows how the plan will benefit borrowers in all fifty states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The administration estimates that over 40 million borrowers are eligible for the relief plan, and nearly 20 million borrowers could have their entire remaining balance discharged. The relief will primarily benefit those earning less than $75,000 per year, with almost 90% of relief dollars going to this group. No relief will be provided to individuals or households in the top 5% of incomes in the United States. The article provides a summary of the data for each state, highlighting the number of borrowers eligible for relief and the amount they could receive.
