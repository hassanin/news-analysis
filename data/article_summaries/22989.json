Tom Foley, a legend in the United States Congress, has passed away. He served as a representative for Washington's 5th district for thirty years, working tirelessly to improve the lives of his constituents. Foley's ability to find common ground with members of both parties earned him the position of Speaker of the House. After his congressional career, he served as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, strengthening the relationship between the two nations. President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama express their condolences to Foley's wife, Heather, and the entire Foley family.
