This statement by the Press Secretary is in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square incident. It expresses the United States' condemnation of the violence used against peaceful demonstrators and calls on Chinese authorities to provide an account of those who were killed, detained, or went missing during the events. The statement emphasizes the United States' support for the basic freedoms that the protesters sought, such as freedom of expression, press, association, and assembly. It acknowledges China's progress over the past three decades but also urges the Chinese government to ensure the universal rights and freedoms of its citizens.
