The Council of Economic Advisers released a report stating that the current economic expansion in the US, which began a decade ago, became the longest in history on July 1, 2019. The report also confirms that economic growth continued in the third quarter of 2019, surpassing market expectations. The Trump Administration's policies are attributed to supporting sustained economic growth and leading to higher incomes for American families. The report compares the US to other developed nations and states that the US economy remains strong, with the highest annual GDP growth rate among G7 countries. The report also mentions that the recent strike at General Motors and production problems at Boeing held down the third quarter growth rate by 0.3 percentage points. The report emphasizes that American workers benefit the most from the economic expansion, with robust growth in spending and income. Real consumer spending and real disposable personal income both increased at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter. The report highlights that workers are entering employment from outside the labor force rather than from unemployment, indicating a positive sign of increased workforce participation. The report concludes that with a record length of economic expansion and a low unemployment rate, the economy is expected to remain strong in future quarters, leading to increased wages and more Americans benefiting from a growing economy.
