The President has issued an Executive Order to address the threat posed by the mobile application WeChat, owned by the Chinese company Tencent Holdings Ltd. This action is taken to protect the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. WeChat, like TikTok, captures vast amounts of personal and proprietary information from its users, which could potentially allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' information. The app is also used to censor politically sensitive content and may be involved in disinformation campaigns. The order prohibits any transaction related to WeChat, with Tencent Holdings Ltd. or its subsidiaries, beginning 45 days after the date of the order. The Secretary of Commerce will identify the transactions subject to this prohibition. The Secretary is delegated the authority to implement the order and all departments and agencies are directed to take appropriate measures to do so.
