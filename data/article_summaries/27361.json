On October 30, 2020, the President signed several bills into law. The "Empowering Olympic, Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act of 2020" provides increased oversight of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee's board of directors and governing bodies, and establishes safeguards to protect amateur athletes from abuse. The "Friendly Airports for Mothers Improvement Act" requires small hub airports to have lactation areas and baby changing tables in restrooms. Another bill makes technical corrections to the Klamath Basin Water Supply Enhancement Act of 2000 and clarifies the status of certain projects in Montana. The "Reinvigorating Lending for the Future Act" allows for the release of certain Federal interests in connection with grants provided under the Economic Development Administration's Revolving Loan Fund Program. Lastly, a bill designates the airport traffic control tower at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, North Carolina, as the Senator Kay Hagan Airport Traffic Control Tower.
