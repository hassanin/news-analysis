On November 27, 2018, the President of the United States declared a national emergency regarding the situation in Nicaragua. This declaration was made due to the violent response by the Nicaraguan government to protests that began on April 18, 2018, as well as their systematic dismantling of democratic institutions and the rule of law. The government's use of indiscriminate violence and repressive tactics against civilians, along with corruption leading to economic destabilization, was seen as posing a significant threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. On October 24, 2022, an executive order was issued to take additional measures in response to this national emergency. As of November 7, 2023, the President has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, as it is believed that the situation in Nicaragua still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States. This decision is made in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
