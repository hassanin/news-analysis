President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring May 5 through May 11, 2019, as National Small Business Week. In the proclamation, he praises America's entrepreneurs and small business owners for their risk-taking, investment in their communities, and job creation. Small businesses are recognized as central to the economy, employing over one-third of the country's labor force. The proclamation highlights the importance of leadership and vision from diverse backgrounds in the success of small businesses. Trump also mentions the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which allows most small businesses to deduct 20% of their taxable business income. Other pro-growth policies, such as eliminating unnecessary regulations, investing in infrastructure and cybersecurity, and making healthcare coverage more affordable, are mentioned as well. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is also discussed, emphasizing its focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. The proclamation concludes by calling on all Americans to recognize the contributions of entrepreneurs and small business owners to the nation's economy.
