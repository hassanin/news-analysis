This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the national emergency with respect to weapons of mass destruction is being continued. The national emergency was initially declared in 1994 due to the threat posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The President has issued various executive orders to respond effectively to this threat, with the most recent one being in 2005. The notice states that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 1994 is being extended for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
