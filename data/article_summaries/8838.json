President Biden has taken significant steps to reduce prescription drug costs for seniors and individuals with employer-based health insurance. However, Congressional Republicans are actively working against these reforms and are pushing for policies that benefit pharmaceutical companies. Some of their agenda includes repealing prescription drug inflation rebates, which currently require pharmaceutical companies to pay a rebate to Medicare if they increase prices faster than inflation. Additionally, Republicans are opposing Medicare's ability to negotiate prescription drug prices, which was granted by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). They also aim to remove caps on insulin prices, which currently benefit Medicare beneficiaries by capping monthly insulin costs at $35. Lastly, Republicans are protecting Big Pharma's ability to avoid paying taxes, opposing the implementation of the global minimum tax agreement negotiated by President Biden. These actions by Congressional Republicans could result in increased prescription drug costs for seniors and hinder international tax reform efforts.
