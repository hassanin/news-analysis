President Barack Obama has proclaimed March 20-26, 2016, as National Poison Prevention Week in the United States. Poisonings are the leading cause of accidental injury death in the country, affecting people of all ages. Over 90% of poisonings occur inside the home, making prevention crucial. The most common sources of poisoning in young children are cleaning and personal care products, as well as medications. Adults are more likely to be poisoned by cleaning products or the misuse of sedatives, antidepressants, pain relievers, or prescription drugs. To prevent poisonings, household products should be kept in their original bottles and out of the reach of children. Carbon monoxide detectors should be used properly, and medications should be stored safely and taken as instructed. The public is encouraged to visit www.PoisonHelp.HRSA.gov for more information on preventing poisonings and www.DEAdiversion.USDOJ.gov for safe drug disposal. Every individual can play a role in preventing poisonings and should immediately call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 if they believe someone has been poisoned. The Congress has authorized the President to designate the third week of March each year as National Poison Prevention Week to raise awareness about accidental poisonings.
