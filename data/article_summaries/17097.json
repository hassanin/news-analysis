On the 35th anniversary of the first documented cases of AIDS, President Obama issued a statement acknowledging the progress made in the fight against HIV/AIDS. He highlighted the importance of testing, treatment, education, and acceptance in saving and extending lives, as well as fighting discrimination. American leadership and ingenuity have shaped the world's response to the crisis, with programs like the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and PEPFAR saving millions of lives. The administration has implemented a comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy, invested in research, and supported the development of tools like treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis. The Affordable Care Act has also provided affordable health coverage without denial for pre-existing conditions like HIV. However, disparities still exist, particularly for economically disadvantaged individuals, gay and bisexual men (especially young and Black men), women of color, and transgender women. The President expressed confidence that by building upon the steps taken, the goal of an AIDS-free generation can be achieved by 2030. He called for remembrance of those lost to the epidemic and a rededication to ending it once and for all.
