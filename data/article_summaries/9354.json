In honor of World AIDS Day, President Joe Biden has emphasized the importance of addressing health inequities and ensuring the voices of people with HIV are heard. He recognizes the progress made in the fight against HIV/AIDS but acknowledges that it remains a serious public health challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for equitable access to HIV prevention, care, and treatment. The Biden administration is committed to ending the HIV epidemic by reinstating the White House Office of National AIDS Policy and releasing an updated National HIV/AIDS Strategy. The budget request includes $670 million to support the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. Initiative. The President also highlights the United States' efforts to end the AIDS epidemic globally through initiatives like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The goal is to achieve sustained epidemic control of HIV by supporting equitable health services and solutions. The President calls for upholding human rights, supporting research and data-driven solutions, expanding access to housing and education, and fighting stigma and discrimination. He proclaims December 1, 2021, as World AIDS Day and urges people to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS and support those living with HIV.
