The joint U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security, launched by President Biden and President von der Leyen, has made significant progress in reducing the EU's reliance on Russian energy. The United States has exceeded its target and doubled its delivery of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the EU. Russian gas now accounts for only 16% of the EU's gas imports, down from 37% in March 2022. The EU has also reduced its overall demand for natural gas by 19% through various measures, including improving energy efficiency and identifying new digital solutions. The Task Force aims to accelerate the global transition to clean energy and achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. In 2023, the Task Force will focus on assessing LNG markets, reducing methane emissions, and implementing energy savings and efficiency measures. It will also work on initiatives to reduce flaring, venting, and leakage in oil and gas value chains. The Task Force will facilitate cooperation on energy efficiency and demand flexibility, and explore opportunities to share best practices for clean energy infrastructure projects. A high-level Business Roundtable on Energy Savings and Renewables is planned for April 2023. The Task Force will continue its work as directed by President von der Leyen and President Biden.
