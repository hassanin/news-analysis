This article is a presidential memorandum issued by Barack Obama on March 13, 2015. The memorandum provides an order of succession within the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), which is responsible for advising the President on environmental issues. The memorandum states that in the event that the Chairman of the CEQ is unable to perform their duties, the following officials in the listed order shall act as and perform the functions and duties of the Chairman: Managing Director, Chief of Staff, General Counsel, and Associate Directors. The memorandum also includes exceptions, stating that no individual serving in an acting capacity shall act as Chairman, and that the President has discretion to depart from this order. The memorandum revokes a previous memorandum from September 2008 that designated officers of the CEQ to act as Chairman. The memorandum concludes with general provisions stating that it does not affect the authority of other agencies or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
