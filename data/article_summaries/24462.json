In this op-ed, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius argues against the repeal of the new health care law by the new Congress. She highlights the benefits of the law, such as providing more freedom in health care choices, preventing insurers from canceling or capping coverage unfairly, and eliminating discrimination against children with disabilities and pregnant women. Sebelius also mentions that the law allows Americans with health conditions to receive necessary care and prohibits insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Repealing the law would allow insurers to resume these practices. Additionally, the new law includes a Patient's Bill of Rights that prevents insurance companies from canceling coverage without cause or implementing lifetime dollar limits on benefits. Repeal would make these practices legal again. Sebelius also points out that the law helps lower health insurance costs for families and small businesses, provides tax credits for small businesses offering coverage, and limits insurers' spending on profits and marketing. Repeal would erase these reforms. She further argues that repeal would force seniors to pay out-of-pocket for preventive care and prescription drugs, while the law offers discounts and eliminates the coverage gap in Medicare. Sebelius concludes by stating that repealing the law would undo the progress made in improving health care and calls for not turning back the clock.
