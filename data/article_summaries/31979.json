The President of the United States, Donald Trump, has issued a statement on June 21, 2019, declaring a national emergency with respect to North Korea. This national emergency was initially declared on June 26, 2008, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, due to the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. The President also found it necessary to maintain certain restrictions on North Korea that would have otherwise been lifted.

Since then, the national emergency has been expanded and modified through several executive orders. These expansions were made to address the continued actions and policies of the North Korean government, including the sinking of the Republic of Korea Navy ship Cheonan, nuclear tests, missile launches, violations of United Nations Security Council Resolutions, and illicit activities such as money laundering, counterfeiting, cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking.

The President has further extended the national emergency for another year, stating that the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, as well as the actions and policies of North Korea, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This extension is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will remain in effect beyond June 26, 2019. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
