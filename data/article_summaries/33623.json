The Trump Administration is hosting the third annual joint review of the European Union-United States Privacy Shield Framework in Washington, D.C. The Privacy Shield Program facilitates compliance with European data protection and privacy requirements for transatlantic commerce. Over 5,000 companies have joined the program, and dozens of senior U.S. government officials and seven federal agencies will participate in the review. The administration is committed to protecting personal data and ensuring the success of the Privacy Shield Framework. Mechanisms like Privacy Shield and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) System protect personal data while bridging differences between national laws to support global commerce and trade. Privacy Shield is a crucial part of the economic relationship between the U.S. and Europe, while the CBPR System supports trade and investment between the U.S. and participating APEC economies. The administration aims to expand the benefits of the CBPR System to more trading partners and maintain a strong partnership with the European Union for the success of the Privacy Shield Framework.
