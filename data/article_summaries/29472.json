President Donald Trump has signed into law the African Growth and Opportunity Act and Millennium Challenge Act Modernization Act. However, he has stated that he will treat a certain section of the Act, which requires notification and consultation with Congress before engaging in certain foreign affairs activities, as advisory. He believes that mandatory consultation is not consistent with the Constitution's separation of powers. While he hopes that notice and consultation will be possible in every case, he wants to ensure that the law does not interfere with his constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs or compromise sensitive diplomatic communications.
