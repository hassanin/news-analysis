On November 14, 1994, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and the means of delivering them. This national emergency was declared due to the unusual and extraordinary threat these weapons pose to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Over the years, this national emergency has been amended and improved through executive orders. On November 12, 2019, President Trump announced that the national emergency declared in 1994 will continue for another year, as the threat of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery still persist. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The announcement will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
