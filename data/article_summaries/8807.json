The President has authorized the deployment of approximately 5,000 U.S. troops to ensure an orderly and safe drawdown of personnel from Afghanistan, as well as the evacuation of Afghans at risk from the Taliban. The Armed Forces and Intelligence Community will maintain capabilities to address future terrorist threats from Afghanistan. The Secretary of State will support Afghan leaders in preventing further bloodshed and pursuing a political settlement, while engaging with regional stakeholders. The Taliban has been warned that any action putting U.S. personnel at risk will be met with a strong military response. Ambassador Tracey Jacobson is leading efforts to process and relocate Afghan Special Immigrant Visa applicants and allies. The President explains that the U.S. went to Afghanistan to defeat the forces responsible for the 9/11 attacks, but after 20 years, an endless presence was not acceptable. The President inherited a deal that left the Taliban in a strong position and imposed a May 1, 2021 deadline for U.S. Forces. The President chose to follow through on the deal with a brief extension rather than sending more troops to fight in another country's civil conflict.
