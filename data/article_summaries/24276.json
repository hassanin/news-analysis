The article discusses a joint statement by Russian President Dmitriy A. Medvedev and US President Barack Obama regarding negotiations on further reductions in strategic offensive arms. The leaders acknowledge that the current Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START Treaty) has fulfilled its purpose and that the maximum levels for strategic offensive arms have already been reached. They have therefore decided to begin negotiations for a new agreement to replace the START Treaty, with the aim of reducing and limiting strategic offensive arms even further. The new agreement will focus on enhancing the security, predictability, and stability of both countries' strategic offensive forces, and will include effective verification measures. The negotiators have been instructed to report on progress by July 2009, and the agreement is intended to be concluded before the expiration of the START Treaty in December.
