President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation establishing the Sand to Snow National Monument in southern California. The area, which includes a portion of the San Bernardino National Forest and connects with Joshua Tree National Park, features a diverse range of plant and animal species and serves as a refuge for desert-dwelling animals and migrating birds. The monument covers approximately 154,000 acres and includes a variety of ecosystems, from lowland deserts to alpine peaks. It is home to federally listed threatened and endangered species, as well as numerous other wildlife species. The Sand to Snow area also has significant cultural and historical importance, with archaeological sites and evidence of past human habitation. The monument will be managed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, and a management plan will be developed to protect and restore the area.
