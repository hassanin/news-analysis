The United States Army will award the Presidential Unit Citation to the 30th Infantry Division, nicknamed the "Old Hickory Division," for their heroic stand at Mortain during World War II. The division faced overwhelming enemy armor when an entire German Panzer Corps attacked them, with Adolf Hitler hoping to prevent American forces from breaking out of the Normandy beachhead. Despite being outnumbered, the soldiers of the 30th Infantry Division fought back, even using cooks, clerks, and drivers as riflemen. With the support of artillery and close air support, the division successfully repelled the German attack and went on to relieve its trapped elements. Over 2,000 soldiers were killed or wounded during the weeklong battle. This award recognizes the division's efforts and sacrifice, and their contribution to the Allied victory in Europe.
