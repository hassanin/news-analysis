The United States and the European Union have announced the Global Methane Pledge, an initiative aimed at reducing global methane emissions. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. The pledge commits countries to reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. This reduction would help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Major sources of methane emissions include oil and gas, coal, agriculture, and landfills. The pledge also highlights the additional benefits of methane reduction, such as improved public health and agricultural productivity. The European Union and eight countries have already expressed their support for the pledge. The European Union has been working to reduce methane emissions for almost three decades and has adopted strategies to address emissions in key sectors. The United States is also taking steps to reduce methane emissions through new regulations for the oil and gas industry, stronger pollution standards for landfills, and efforts to promote climate-smart agriculture practices. Both the European Union and the United States are supporting international methane mitigation efforts. The Global Methane Pledge will be formally launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in November.
