Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economic Affairs, Mike Froman, held a press gaggle in which he discussed the recent meeting of the nine TPP countries. The leaders agreed on the broad outlines of an agreement on TPP and set an aggressive timetable to complete the agreement in 2012. They also discussed the standards and objectives of the agreement and how to address the interest of additional countries, including Japan, in joining TPP. Froman emphasized that the leaders see TPP as an open platform that they hope to expand and have other countries join, provided that the high standards and level of ambition are maintained. He also highlighted the importance of political will and commitment in furthering these trade negotiations. Froman provided some statistics on the importance of the TPP countries in terms of trade and potential for further expansion. He mentioned that Japan is the only country whose leader has made a public announcement of interest in joining TPP, but there are other countries that have expressed interest privately. Froman stated that consultations with Japan and other potential interested countries will start and the U.S. will have a better idea of Japan's intentions following a meeting between President Obama and Prime Minister Noda. He also mentioned that China was not discussed in the meeting and that there is no firm deadline for the completion of the agreement. Froman emphasized that TPP is not an alternative to making progress in the multilateral trading system, but rather a way to pursue trade liberalization in addition to other agreements. He mentioned that Taiwan and South Korea have expressed interest in joining TPP, but there was no discussion about them in the meeting. Froman stated that it is unlikely that the TPP parties will reopen agreed-upon texts with new entrants, but each country's unique circumstances will have to be addressed in the process of joining TPP.
