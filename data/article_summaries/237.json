The article discusses a preview of announcements that will be made as part of a coordinated G7 announcement on Tuesday. The United States, along with its allies and partners, has taken significant actions to impose costs on Russia, including imposing sanctions and decreasing exports to Russia. The U.S. will continue to increase pressure on Russia by announcing new actions. These actions include developing mechanisms to set a global price cap for Russian oil, expanding targeted sanctions on Russia's access to key industrial inputs and technologies, using tariffs on Russian goods to help Ukraine, imposing sanctions on those responsible for human rights abuses, and providing financial support to Ukraine. The details of the price cap and its impact on consumer prices are still being worked out. The G7's actions aim to deny Russia revenue, minimize disruptions in global energy markets, and hold Russia accountable for its actions in Ukraine.
