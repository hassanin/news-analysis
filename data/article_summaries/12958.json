On February 1, 2010, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 1377, mandates that the Department of Veterans Affairs must cover the cost of emergency medical treatment for certain veterans in non-departmental facilities. The second bill, S. 692, states that any claims by the United States to documents related to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which were in the possession of his last personal secretary Grace Tully at the time of her death, will be waived if those documents are gifted to the National Archives and Records Administration.
