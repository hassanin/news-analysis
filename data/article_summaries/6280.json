The Biden-Harris Administration has announced accelerated efforts to protect Americans from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which can cause severe health problems and persist in the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has launched a comprehensive strategy called the PFAS Roadmap, which includes steps to control PFAS at its sources, hold polluters accountable, and address the impacts on disadvantaged communities. The administration is also working to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and Build Back Better Agenda, which include funding to address PFAS contamination in drinking water. The FDA has conducted testing of the food supply for potential PFAS contamination, and the Department of Defense (DOD) has invested in research and development programs to address PFAS detection, treatment, and destruction. Other agencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are also taking steps to address PFAS exposure and its health impacts.
