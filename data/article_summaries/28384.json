The United States is taking action to prevent Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his regime from exploiting the country's resources for personal gain while the Venezuelan people suffer. The Department of the Treasury has sanctioned a major Venezuelan bank and four subsidiary banks that have been used by Maduro and his regime to evade US sanctions and move money out of Venezuela. The US will continue to put pressure on Maduro and his supporters until they allow for a democratic transition under Interim President Juan Guaido and the National Assembly of Venezuela.
