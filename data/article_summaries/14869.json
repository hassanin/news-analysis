The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet on the Seventh Review Conference of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC). The BWC is an important tool in countering biological threats, and the United States is committed to its implementation. The conference will evaluate the treaty's implementation and plan for the future. The United States believes that the BWC should be the primary forum for bringing together various communities to address evolving biological risks. The United States will propose a work program for the next five years, focusing on strengthening implementation, building global capacities, and assessing developments in science and technology. By pursuing this program, the international community can produce concrete results and ensure successful future conferences.
