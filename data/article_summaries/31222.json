President Trump is set to visit the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima, Ohio, to highlight how his administration saved the tank factory from closure under President Obama. This factory represents Trump's belief that economic security is national security. In 2012, the Obama administration planned to close the Lima plant due to budget cuts, but Congress rejected the move. However, the number of employees decreased to just 75. Under Trump, the defense budget has increased, with an additional $11 billion allocated to buy combat vehicles like the Abrams, which are manufactured in Lima. This has created jobs and revitalized the plant. The production of state-of-the-art tanks also enhances national security and allows for conventional arms sales to allies. The decision to rescue the Lima plant will have long-lasting benefits for the nation and its workers.
