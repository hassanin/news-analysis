Each year in the United States, over 2 million cases of poisoning are reported, many of which are preventable. Despite progress, poisoning remains a risk, particularly for children and older Americans. During National Poison Prevention Week, awareness is raised about the dangers of poisonous substances, preventative measures, and how to respond in a poison emergency. Unintentional poisonings at home lead to an average of 31 child deaths and 75,000 children under five being hospitalized each year. Approximately 85% of unintentional poisonings occur in the home, where medicines and harmful chemicals are stored. To prevent accidental ingestion, it is important to keep these products out of sight and reach of children. Child-resistant packaging should be used for items such as hand sanitizer, laundry detergent, medications, cleaning products, and liquid nicotine. Medications should be securely stored and properly discarded when unused. For older Americans, it is crucial to secure household products in their original packaging and clearly label medications to avoid accidental ingestion or confusion. Poison control centers play a critical role in responding to calls and providing assistance and information. If poisoning is suspected, the Poison Control Help line should be immediately contacted at 800-222-1222. National Poison Prevention Week aims to raise awareness, promote control measures, and educate the public about the dangers of accidental poisonings to save lives. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed March 20 to March 26, 2022, as National Poison Prevention Week, calling upon all Americans to take actions to protect their loved ones from poisonous substances and raise awareness to prevent accidental injuries and deaths.
