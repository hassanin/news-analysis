On December 18, 2010, the President signed several bills into law. These include: 

1. H.R. 2480, the "Truth in Fur Labeling Act of 2010," which eliminates the exemption for federal fur product labeling requirements for articles of apparel with a small quantity or value of fur. It also provides an exemption for fur products sold by individuals who trapped or hunted the animal, as long as the revenue from these sales is not their primary source of income.

2. H.R. 3237, which codifies certain laws related to national and commercial space programs as a new title 51 of the United States Code.

3. H.R. 6184, which extends the Army's authority to accept and expend funds contributed by non-Federal entities to expedite the processing of permits until December 31, 2016.

4. H.R. 6399, which increases the number of positions under the jurisdiction of the Architect of the Capitol for which the Architect is authorized to fix the rate of pay. It also provides certain funds for the acquisition of real property for the use of the U.S. Capitol Police.

5. S. 3789, the "Social Security Number Protection Act of 2010," which prohibits the use of social security numbers on government-issued checks.
