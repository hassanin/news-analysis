On June 2, 2017, the President signed two laws. The first law, S. 419, is called the "Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act of 2017." It modifies the eligibility requirements for the Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program administered by the Department of Justice. It also requires the Department to process PSOB claims quickly and with transparency. The second law, S. 583, is called the "American Law Enforcement Heroes Act of 2017." It authorizes the Department of Justice to provide grants for community oriented policing services, with the goal of prioritizing the hiring and training of veterans as career law enforcement officers.
