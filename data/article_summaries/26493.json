President Donald J. Trump has introduced a tax bill that aims to create new opportunity zones, encouraging investment in distressed communities and creating job opportunities for marginalized individuals. These Opportunity Zones will attract private investment to revitalize struggling communities and stimulate economic growth. The goal is to uplift communities that have been overlooked and left behind.
