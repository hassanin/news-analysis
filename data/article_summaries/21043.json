President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring November 13-19, 2016 as Get Smart About Antibiotics Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of using antibiotics responsibly and highlights the risks associated with their misuse. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause thousands of deaths and millions of illnesses each year in the United States. Inappropriate use of antibiotics, including using them for viral infections or in wrong doses, can increase the likelihood of antibiotic resistance. The proclamation also mentions the actions taken by the Obama Administration to combat antibiotic resistance, such as creating a task force and launching a national action plan. The proclamation calls upon the scientific community, medical professionals, educators, businesses, industry leaders, and all Americans to promote responsible antibiotic use and raise awareness about the dangers of misuse and overuse.
