The White House has issued a letter stating that President Barack Obama has terminated the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13617 and revoked that order. The national emergency was declared in response to the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in Russia. However, with the successful implementation of the Agreement Between the US and Russia Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Extracted from Nuclear Weapons, there is no longer a need for the protective measures imposed by Executive Order 13617. The letter assures that all payments due to Russia under the agreement have been properly transferred and that the assets are protected.
