The US Treasury Department has issued a statement regarding Chrysler's planned dealer consolidation. The announcement is part of Chrysler's efforts to restructure and achieve financial viability. Previously, Chrysler faced the possibility of liquidation, which would have resulted in the closure of all 3,200 of its dealerships. However, due to the successful partnership with Fiat and the support of the President's Auto Task Force, Chrysler is now able to move forward with a plan that retains 75% of its dealers, representing 87% of Chrysler sales. The Task Force was not involved in the design or implementation of the dealer consolidation plan. While the rationalization will be challenging for the affected dealers and communities, it is deemed necessary for the company and the industry to succeed. The Treasury Department is committed to ensuring financing is available to creditworthy dealers and boosting domestic demand for cars to support the auto industry and the American economy.
