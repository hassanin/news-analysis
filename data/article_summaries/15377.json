President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Nebraska and has ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding occurred from June 1-4, 2014. Federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Burt, Butler, Cass, Hamilton, Holt, Nemaha, Pawnee, Polk, Rock, Thurston, Valley, and Washington are eligible for this assistance. Additionally, federal funding will be available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Christian Van Alstyne has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and more designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and deemed necessary.
