The article discusses how highway spending from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act is expected to create or save 150,000 jobs by the end of 2010. The investment calls for spending $28 billion on highway construction, which will be allocated to states across the nation. These jobs in highway construction tend to pay better than the average wage. There are two sources by which these jobs come about: the direct impact of building new roads and fixing old ones, and the indirect economic activity generated when these workers spend more. Overall, this investment is predicted to have a positive impact on job growth and help offset job losses in the country.
