In recognition of Mental Health Awareness Month, the White House has convened state legislators from 10 states to discuss legislation aimed at improving mental health care. This follows previous forums and meetings on mental health held by the Biden-Harris Administration. The administration has made mental health a top priority and has invested significant resources in addressing the mental health crisis, particularly among young people. As part of Mental Health Awareness Month, the administration has announced actions and investments, including funding for school-based mental health services and crisis response services. During the convening, legislators discussed steps they are taking at the state level to address the mental health crisis, such as improving access to care in schools and universities and expanding the mental health workforce. White House officials expressed gratitude for their efforts and ongoing partnership in improving mental health care for all Americans.
