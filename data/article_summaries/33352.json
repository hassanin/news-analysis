President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to enhance mental health services for recently discharged veterans. The order makes a wide range of mental health services available to all veterans as they transition back to civilian society. Previously, these services were only available to about 40 percent of recently discharged veterans, mostly from combat ranks. The order also directs Cabinet-level agencies to ensure that these services are plentiful and available. The Department of Veterans Affairs will expand its use of telemedicine and technology to connect veterans with care and allow them to schedule appointments online. In addition, veterans can schedule appointments in the private sector if the VA system cannot provide prompt treatment. The aim of the order is to combat the high suicide rates among former service members, particularly those fresh out of uniform.
