This article acknowledges the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia, which commemorates the World Health Organization's decision in 1990 to remove 'homosexuality' from the list of mental disorders. The article highlights the progress that has been made for the LGBTQI+ community, including the legalization of marriage equality and increased protections against hate crimes. However, it also recognizes that challenges remain, such as the impact of COVID-19 and rising authoritarianism, which worsen economic, social, and safety disparities for LGBTQI+ individuals. The article notes that violence, particularly against transgender women and girls of color, continues to be a significant issue. It also mentions that 70 countries still criminalize same-sex relationships, while LGBTQI+ Americans in 25 states lack basic protections and face discrimination in various areas. The current administration pledges support for the LGBTQI+ community, highlighting the rollback of discriminatory policies and the appointment of LGBTQI+ individuals to high-level government positions. The administration is also working towards advancing equality and equity through executive orders and urging Congress to pass the Equality Act, which would protect civil rights based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of dignity and equality for everyone, regardless of their identity or whom they love, and the commitment to collaborating with allies to promote LGBTQI+ human rights worldwide.
