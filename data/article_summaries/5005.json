National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan delivered closing remarks at the High-Level Multi-stakeholder Hybrid Event on the Declaration for the Future of the Internet (DFI). The event aimed to promote the DFI vision and principles and was organized by the European Commission, the European External Action Service, and the Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Sullivan welcomed new countries that endorsed the DFI and reaffirmed the U.S. endorsement of its vision and principles. The DFI aims to create a common vision for an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet and digital technologies. Sullivan stated that the U.S. plans to bring the DFI's principles into action during the United States chairship of the Freedom Online Coalition in 2023 and the next Summit for Democracy. He also mentioned that the Biden Administration recently issued a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which provides guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence in ways that uphold democratic values. Additionally, Sullivan announced that the United States and European Commission intend to collaborate on research projects in areas such as extreme weather and climate forecasting, health and medicine, electric grid optimization, agriculture optimization, and emergency response management.
