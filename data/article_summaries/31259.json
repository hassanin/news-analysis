During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer introduced the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, to discuss President Trump's budget blueprint. Mulvaney explained that the blueprint is not a full budget, but rather a topline number that reflects the President's policies on discretionary spending. The blueprint prioritizes rebuilding the military, protecting the nation, securing the border, enforcing laws, taking care of veterans, and increasing school choice. Mulvaney also noted that the budget does not include mandatory spending, entitlement reforms, tax policies, revenue projections, or the infrastructure plan. He stated that the full budget will be released in May. After Mulvaney's remarks, Spicer fielded questions on various topics, including the Russia investigation, entitlements, infrastructure, and healthcare. He also addressed concerns about wasteful Pentagon spending and the reception the President may receive from Democrats during his joint address to Congress. Spicer also confirmed that there will be a revised executive order on immigration issued in the middle of the week.
