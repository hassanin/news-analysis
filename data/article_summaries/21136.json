In this article, President Barack Obama issues a memorandum suspending the limitations imposed by the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995. The Act requires the relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, President Obama determines that it is necessary to suspend these limitations for a period of 6 months in order to protect the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary of State is directed to transmit this determination to Congress, along with a report, and to publish it in the Federal Register.
