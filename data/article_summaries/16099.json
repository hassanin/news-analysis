The President commends California for raising the minimum wage and expanding paid sick leave for workers. He praises California for ensuring that workers will no longer earn a wage that keeps many families in poverty. The President also mentions that 18 states and the District of Columbia have raised the minimum wage since he called on Congress to do so in 2013. He urges Congress to take action and do what is right for every hard-working American and for the economy.
