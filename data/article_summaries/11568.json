He highlights the devastating impact of cancer, with half a million Americans estimated to lose their lives to the disease this year, and three times as many being diagnosed. The President emphasizes the importance of prevention and screening as the best defenses against cancer, encouraging Americans to maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, limit sun exposure, avoid excessive alcohol consumption, and live tobacco-free. He also mentions that under the Affordable Care Act, over 54 million Americans with private health coverage have received preventive services, including cancer screenings, at no additional cost.
