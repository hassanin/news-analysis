This article provides an update on the progress of President Obama's immigration accountability administrative actions. The actions, announced in November 2014, aim to enhance border security, prioritize the deportation of enforcement priorities, and modernize the legal immigration system. The Council of Economic Advisors estimates that these actions could boost the economy by $100 billion to $250 billion and increase average annual wages for US-born workers by 0.4%. While some of the new deferred action policies have been temporarily put on hold due to litigation, other actions have moved forward. These include implementing new enforcement priorities, establishing a new Priority Enforcement Program focused on convicted criminals, developing a new Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Strategy, realigning ICE personnel and pay structure, allowing spouses of high-skilled nonimmigrants to request work authorization, clarifying options for multinational companies transferring skilled employees, providing support for vulnerable workers who are victims of crime and human trafficking, enhancing immigrant worker protections, publishing the White House Task Force on New Americans Strategic Action Plan, and publishing recommendations to modernize and streamline the legal immigration system. The article concludes by noting that while these actions are important, only Congress can fully fix the broken immigration system, and the President continues to urge Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
