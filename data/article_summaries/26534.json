In this op-ed, Eric Hargan, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, responds to a recent column that claims the US government has lost 1,475 migrant children. Hargan argues that this claim misrepresents the situation. When unaccompanied alien children (UAC) are caught trying to enter the US illegally, they are required by law to be referred to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). ORR is then responsible for finding a parent, close relative, or appropriate sponsor to take the children in. Hargan explains that historically, ORR has not tracked the children once released, but in 2016 they began making calls to sponsors 30 days after placement. However, during one recent period, 14% of sponsors did not respond to the call, leading to the claim that children were lost. Hargan argues that this logic would suggest that the Obama administration had also "lost" many children. He suggests that many sponsors do not respond because they are in the US illegally themselves, and some may have even arranged for their children to join them through the UAC system. Hargan concludes by stating that the Trump administration is working to close loopholes in the immigration system that allow and encourage illegal immigration, and calls on Congress to help.
