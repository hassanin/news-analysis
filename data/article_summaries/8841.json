The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) have issued a statement expressing their support for Ukraine and condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin's military aggression. They denounce the suffering and loss of life caused by the indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilians. The G7 leaders are determined to hold President Putin accountable and call for an immediate halt to the assault on Ukraine and the withdrawal of Russian forces. They also urge Russia to allow safe humanitarian access and the safe passage of civilians wishing to leave. The G7 countries have imposed restrictive measures on Russia, including isolating Russian banks, cutting off advanced technologies, and targeting those responsible for the war. They plan to reduce reliance on Russian energy and support companies in leaving the Russian market. The G7 leaders commit to taking further measures to isolate Russia economically, such as revoking Russia's Most-Favored-Nation status and preventing it from obtaining financing from international financial institutions. They will also continue to put pressure on Russian elites, freeze assets, prevent evasion of sanctions, and combat Russian disinformation. The G7 stands in solidarity with Ukraine and is prepared to take further actions to hold President Putin accountable.
