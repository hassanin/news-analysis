President Obama recently held a meeting with various independent financial regulators to discuss the progress made in strengthening the financial system and protecting consumers. The regulators included the Comptroller of the Currency, the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Acting Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and the chairs of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Treasury Secretary Jack Lew also attended the meeting. The President commended the regulators for their work but emphasized the need to expedite the implementation of the remaining portions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The President also discussed the housing market and the need for a simplified and certain housing finance system that better serves middle-class families. The group also discussed the importance of interagency coordination and the challenges posed by the current budget environment.
