President Obama will host a forum in Washington, D.C. from August 3-5, 2010, with approximately 120 young leaders from civil society and the private sector representing more than forty countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The forum aims to forge strong partnerships and discuss key themes such as youth empowerment, good governance, and economic opportunity. The participants will have a town hall meeting with President Obama to discuss their vision for transforming their societies over the next fifty years. The forum will also include small-group discussions on topics such as transparency, job creation, rights advocacy, and the use of technology. The U.S. government's role is to encourage networks between young American and African leaders and pursue lasting partnerships for common security and prosperity. This dialogue and follow-up events in Africa will help assess how to support Africa's aspirations going forward.
