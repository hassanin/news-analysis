The article discusses the Obama Administration's commitment to assisting Americans with disabilities, particularly in light of the Olmstead v. L.C. Supreme Court ruling in 1999. The ruling declared that the isolation of people with disabilities in institutions is unlawful discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Obama Administration has made progress in enforcing the Olmstead ruling and improving the lives of people with disabilities.

In April of that year, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established the Administration for Community Living (ACL), which combines various HHS organizations and offices dedicated to improving the lives of those with disabilities into one agency. The ACL focuses on increasing access to community supports and achieving full community participation for people with disabilities and seniors.

HHS has also collaborated with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to develop and subsidize rental housing for low-income adults with disabilities. HUD announced a new funding opportunity under the Section 811 program to provide support and services that help people live in integrated settings in the community.

The Department of Justice has also been involved in enforcing the ADA and Olmstead. Over the past three years, the Civil Rights Division has been engaged in more than 40 Olmstead matters in 25 states. Recently, the Department entered into a landmark settlement agreement with Virginia to shift the state's developmental disabilities system from large, state-run institutions to community-based services that promote integration, independence, and full participation for people with disabilities.

The Department of Justice has a dedicated website for Olmstead enforcement, providing access to settlements, briefs, findings letters, and other materials related to the issue.
