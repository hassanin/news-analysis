The United States and the Republic of Kazakhstan have announced their commitment to strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime and enhancing nuclear security. Kazakhstan has completed the conversion of the VVR-K research reactor to low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel and has eliminated all fresh highly enriched uranium (HEU) from the reactor. Kazakhstan has also committed to converting other research reactors to LEU fuel and returning the HEU spent fuel to Russia. The parties support the use of new technologies that do not require sensitive nuclear materials. They are also pleased with the establishment of the Nuclear Security Training Center, which will offer training in nuclear nonproliferation and countering illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. The United States and Kazakhstan will work together on various aspects of nuclear security, including guard force training, inventory management systems, site and transportation security, cyber security, and global nuclear detection. They also emphasize the importance of the Nuclear Security Summit process and ongoing collaboration on strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime.
