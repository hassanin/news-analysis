The Obama Administration has announced plans to invest $3.2 billion in energy efficiency and conservation projects in U.S. cities, counties, states, territories, and Native American tribes. This funding, provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will support projects that reduce total energy use and fossil fuel emissions, improve energy efficiency, and create jobs. The funding will be used for energy audits, energy efficiency retrofits, development of advanced building codes, financial incentive programs for energy efficiency improvements, transportation programs that conserve energy, and renewable energy installations on government buildings, among other activities. The Department of Energy will require grant recipients to report on the number of jobs created or retained, energy saved, renewable energy capacity installed, greenhouse gas emissions reduced, and funds leveraged. The funding will be distributed based on a formula that accounts for population and energy use. Nearly $1.9 billion will go to cities and counties, $770 million to states and territories, and over $54 million to Tribal governments. There will also be a separate competitive solicitation for local energy efficiency projects, with up to $456 million of funding available. This announcement is in addition to the nearly $8 billion recently released by the DOE to support weatherization and state energy projects.
