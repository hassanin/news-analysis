The American Rescue Plan (ARP) has provided economic relief to Americans through COVID-19 vaccinations and financial assistance. Oversight is crucial to ensure relief is distributed efficiently and equitably. The Department of Justice has taken action against criminal abuse of relief programs, and the White House ARP implementation team has prioritized transparency and accountability. Identity theft and the exploitation of relief programs by criminal syndicates are serious concerns. To address this, an interagency COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force has been created to investigate and prosecute criminals and recover stolen funds. The ARP Implementation Coordinator will also launch an Initiative on Identity Theft Prevention and Public Benefits to develop recommendations to prevent fraud. Independent oversight bodies will be involved in this process. The administration is committed to ensuring that relief funds reach American families, local businesses, and schools as intended.
