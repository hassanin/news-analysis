President Obama has declared a major disaster in Nebraska due to severe storms, flooding, tornadoes, and straight-line winds that occurred in September 2010. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Funding will be available for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Stephen R. Thompson as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-3272.
