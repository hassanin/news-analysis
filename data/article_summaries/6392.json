More than 1,000 Federal personnel are on the ground in Maui to support response efforts following the devastating wildfires. President Biden signed a Major Disaster Declaration for Hawaii and launched a whole-of-government effort to assist affected residents and communities. The President and First Lady will visit Maui to meet with survivors, first responders, and officials. The Federal government will continue to provide support as needed for the state's recovery. Various Federal departments and agencies are working with state and local partners to assess needs and provide resources and personnel. Individuals impacted by the disaster are encouraged to register for Federal assistance. A joint Disaster Recovery Center has been opened for individuals to receive personal assistance and access additional support services. The center is open seven days a week.
