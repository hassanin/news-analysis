President Obama met with immigration advocacy leaders, including Latino, Asian American, and Pacific Islander (AAPI) groups, to discuss the Administration's immigration accountability executive actions. The meeting also focused on efforts to secure funding for the Department of Homeland Security and to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Despite a court ruling, the Administration remains committed to implementing deferred action policies and making progress on other aspects of the executive actions. The advocates agreed to continue outreach efforts, work with the Administration, and push for immigration reform as a lasting solution.
