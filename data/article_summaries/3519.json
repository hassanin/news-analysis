On July 25, 2023, the President signed the "Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act of 2023" into law. This act mandates that every agency, when notifying the public about a proposed rule, must include a link to a 100-word summary written in plain language. The Senators Lankford, Sinema, Johnson, Risch, Braun, and Peters were recognized for their leadership in supporting this legislation.
