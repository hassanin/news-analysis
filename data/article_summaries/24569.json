President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring October 3, 2016, as Child Health Day. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of ensuring that children have access to quality healthcare and are provided with a clean and supportive environment. The Obama Administration has prioritized children's health, particularly through initiatives such as the Let's Move! campaign to combat childhood obesity. The Affordable Care Act has also ensured that children cannot be denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions and allows young people to remain on their parents' insurance plans until age 26. The proclamation also addresses the importance of addressing mental and emotional health, as well as combatting bullying. Additionally, the Obama Administration has taken steps to combat climate change and protect the environment for future generations. The proclamation calls upon families, educators, health professionals, and all levels of government to contribute to the health and well-being of America's children.
