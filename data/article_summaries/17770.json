On February 27, 2009, the Middle Class Task Force, led by Vice President Joe Biden, held its first official meeting in Philadelphia. The focus of the meeting was on green jobs as a pathway to a strong middle class. The Task Force heard presentations from experts on the potential to create green jobs as part of economic recovery and on how to connect people to training and opportunities in the green economy. Several cabinet members and members of the Task Force, as well as Pennsylvania Governor Edward G. Rendell and members of the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation, joined the discussion. The meeting included two panels: one on green jobs and their benefits for the middle class, and another on the roles of stakeholders in creating green opportunities. The panelists included individuals from organizations such as the Center for American Progress, Green for All, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Steelworkers of America, and Gerding-Edlen Development. The event was open to the press, and materials distributed at the meeting were made available on the Middle Class Task Force's public website.
