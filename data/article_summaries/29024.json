President Donald Trump's "America First" reforms have led to a record-setting economy, a commitment to keeping wealth in the country, and a focus on American workers. Since Trump took office, over 3.8 million jobs have been created, with manufacturing jobs returning at the fastest pace in two decades. The President's tax cuts have played a significant role in the booming economy, with GDP growth exceeding early estimates at 4.2 percent. Trump has also renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to protect American workers and manufacturing. Additionally, the Trump Administration has pushed for legislation and initiatives that ensure economic growth benefits all citizens, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Pledge to America's Workers.
