The United States and Ghana have a strong bilateral relationship based on historical, cultural, and economic ties, as well as shared democratic values. They work closely together to address common challenges in West Africa and globally. The Vice President's recent visit to Ghana reaffirms this partnership and collaboration on various issues. The United States plans to provide $139 million in bilateral assistance for Ghana in Fiscal Year 2024.

During the visit, the Vice President announced that the Biden-Harris Administration intends to invest over $100 million to support conflict prevention and stabilization efforts in Coastal West Africa, with at least $86 million dedicated to implementing a 10-year plan. This plan aims to address regional threats of violent extremism and instability and includes a holistic approach combining security, development, and peacebuilding.

The United States is also supporting economic development and governance in at-risk communities, including northern Ghana, through programs implemented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of State. Efforts to increase regional trade and provide access to finance for entrepreneurs are underway through programs like USAID's Africa Trade and Investment program.

Additionally, the United States is collaborating with international partners to invest in border governance and strengthen unity between local populations and security actors. The Department of Defense is providing civil-military engagements, capacity building, and training for partner forces.

The United States is also supporting Ghana's economic recovery and debt restructuring, promoting regional integration, empowering women economically, addressing shared health challenges, advancing creative economies, and pursuing innovative solutions for climate resilience, adaptation, and clean energy.
