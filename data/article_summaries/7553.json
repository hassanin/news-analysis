The article discusses a recent U.S. counterterrorism operation in Kabul, Afghanistan, where the U.S. targeted and killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current leader of al Qaeda. The operation was carried out by an unmanned aerial vehicle and two Hellfire missiles were fired at Zawahiri. The U.S. government had been aware of a network supporting Zawahiri and had been monitoring for indications of al Qaeda's presence in Afghanistan. Zawahiri's family had relocated to a safe house in Kabul, which allowed the U.S. to identify his location through multiple streams of intelligence. The operation was planned and executed with the goal of minimizing the risk of civilian casualties. The article also mentions the involvement of the Haqqani Taliban and the implications of cooperating with the Taliban going forward. The President was kept informed throughout the operation and authorized the strike with the condition of minimizing civilian casualties. The death of Zawahiri is seen as a significant blow to al Qaeda and a measure of closure for the victims of 9/11.
