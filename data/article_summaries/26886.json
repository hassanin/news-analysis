President Donald J. Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum directing his Cabinet to provide general use face masks to healthcare workers. This action aims to protect the health and safety of the American people, particularly healthcare providers, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The administration has also taken steps to support manufacturers in producing millions of additional masks for healthcare workers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has incentivized the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and other products related to COVID-19. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration has issued a letter allowing the availability of millions of general use respirators to ensure the safety of healthcare workers and address supply concerns. The memorandum suggests that Congress should consider making these protections permanent by amending the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act.
