This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by Barack Obama on November 21, 2014, titled "Creating Welcoming Communities and Fully Integrating Immigrants and Refugees". The memorandum emphasizes the contributions of immigrants and refugees to the United States and highlights their economic impact. It establishes a White House Task Force on New Americans, which will work to develop a coordinated federal strategy to integrate new Americans into communities and support state and local efforts in this regard. The Task Force consists of various government officials and aims to identify and disseminate best practices, provide assistance to existing federal grantees, collect and share integration data, conduct outreach, and strengthen access to services for new Americans. Within 120 days, the Task Force is required to develop and submit an Integration Plan to the President, which will include assessments of the efforts made by each member's department or agency and recommendations for further evaluation and implementation. The Task Force will also provide a status report within one year and periodically update the Integration Plan. The memorandum concludes by stating that it does not impair existing authorities or create new rights or benefits.
