The National Law Enforcement Accountability Database has been launched as part of an executive order on policing. This database will track records of serious misconduct by federal law enforcement officers to help agencies make informed hiring decisions. Efforts are also being made to encourage state and local law enforcement agencies to access similar records. The executive order aims to rebuild trust and deliver significant police reform, including banning chokeholds, strengthening use-of-force policies, and restricting no-knock warrants. Trust between law enforcement and communities is crucial for public safety and fighting crime. However, lasting change at the state and local levels requires action from Congress. The President urges Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to enhance accountability, transparency, and public trust in law enforcement nationwide.
