President Obama has declared a major disaster in Oklahoma and has ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following the Freedom Wildfire that occurred from August 3-14, 2012. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in Creek County, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Hazard mitigation measures will also be funded on a cost-sharing basis statewide. William J. Doran III has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling FEMA. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
