Congressman Chet Edwards expressed his support for the bipartisan tax cut agreement outlined by the President. He believes that raising taxes during a sluggish economy is not the right approach and hopes that the business and payroll tax cuts will encourage investment and consumption to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment and deficits. However, he emphasizes the need for a long-term deficit reduction plan to accompany this tax cut agreement, stating that long-term economic growth cannot occur without a credible plan to cut long-term spending and deficits. Edwards is a senior member of both the House Budget and Appropriations Committees.
