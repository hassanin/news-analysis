On April 19, 2022, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 3197, known as the "Save the Liberty Theater Act of 2021," directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer specified parcels of land to the City of Eunice, Louisiana. The transfer will be done through a quitclaim deed, and the United States will relinquish all right, title, and interest in the land without receiving any compensation.

The second bill, H.R. 5681, called the "Shadow Wolves Enhancement Act," allows U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to reclassify officers assigned to the tactical patrol unit on Tohono Oâ€™odham Nation land, also known as Shadow Wolves, as ICE special agents. This reclassification gives these officers additional authority and responsibilities.

The President expressed gratitude to Representative Mike Johnson and Senator Kennedy for their leadership on H.R. 3197. Additionally, Representatives Katko, Cuellar, Cole, Joyce, Mullin, Gallego, and Senators Sinema, Hoeven, Kelly, and Hassan were thanked for their leadership on H.R. 5681.
