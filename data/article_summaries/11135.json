In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest addressed several issues including the situation in Greece, Puerto Rico's debt, the Supreme Court decision on mercury emissions, and the ongoing Iran nuclear deal negotiations. Earnest stated that the President supports Greece's efforts to find a solution that allows the country to return to growth and debt sustainability within the Eurozone. He also mentioned that the U.S. exposure to Greece is small in terms of direct exposure, but robust growth and economic stability in Europe is in the interest of the U.S. He stated that the U.S. is committed to working with Puerto Rico to address its financial challenges, but there will be no federal bailout. Earnest also discussed the Supreme Court decision on mercury emissions, stating that it does not impact the Clean Power Plan and that the administration is still reviewing the decision. He mentioned that the U.S. is hopeful that a final agreement can be reached in the Iran nuclear deal negotiations, but there is no specific deadline and negotiations may extend past the original deadline. Earnest also addressed concerns about potential terrorist attacks during the 4th of July holiday, stating that there is no specific credible intelligence to indicate any threats, but the administration remains vigilant.
