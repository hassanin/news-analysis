Second Lady Karen Pence and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue have unveiled a newly-installed beehive on the grounds of the Vice President's residence to draw attention to the decline in pollinator numbers. They urged Americans to do their part in helping reverse the population trend of bees, butterflies, birds, and bats, as they are essential for producing much of the nation's food. Perdue declared June 19-25, 2017, as "National Pollinator Week" and highlighted the efforts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency in creating a National Pollinator Health Strategy. The decline in honeybee hives in the U.S. has been attributed to various factors such as colony collapse disorder, parasites, transportation, pesticides, and poor nutrition. The lack of supportive habitat near hives also contributes to the decline. People can help by planting bee-friendly flowers and herbs and providing water sources for bees. The newly installed beehive at the Vice President's Residence is a triple-deep "Langstroth" beehive obtained from Eco Honeybees and currently houses almost 20,000 bees.
