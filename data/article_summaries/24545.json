President Obama and Prime Minister Hatoyama of Japan met in 2009 to discuss their commitment to expanding cooperative activities in technology research and development for clean energy. They announced several areas of joint cooperation, including: 
1. Acceleration of joint activities between national laboratories of the United States and Japan through R&D cooperation, exchanges of information, and collaboration on standards research.
2. Evaluation of existing clean energy projects in Hawaii and Okinawa to enable the islands to be energy independent and sharing experiences and knowledge between the two islands.
3. Deepening cooperation in the area of smart grid through information sharing and development of standards.
4. Cooperation on carbon capture and storage, including modeling, testing, and data sharing to predict and mitigate risks, and the development of new capture methods and monitoring tools.
5. Strengthened partnership on nuclear energy, including advanced fuel cycle technologies, effective use of existing facilities, and enhanced seismic safety technologies, while ensuring nuclear non-proliferation, safety, and security.
6. Enhancement of cooperative research, development, and deployment activities in areas such as basic research, renewables, energy-efficient buildings, and next-generation vehicles.
7. Close cooperation on energy issues and joint projects in multilateral frameworks including the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF), International Energy Agency (IEA), Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP), International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and especially the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), which Japan chairs in 2010 and the United States in 2011.
