The Trump Administration has been making efforts to combat terrorist radicalization and recruitment, particularly through online propaganda. They have encouraged technology companies to enforce their terms of service and community standards that prohibit the use of their platforms for terrorist purposes. Industry leaders have also launched the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, resulting in significant progress in removing terrorist content from platforms like Facebook and YouTube. However, the government and industry partners recognize that reactive measures alone are not enough, and efforts must be made to promote credible alternative narratives and prevent the emergence of new terrorists. This includes collaborating with partners like Jordan and addressing both international and domestic extremist movements. While protecting freedom of expression is important, it is a challenging task that requires collective effort.
