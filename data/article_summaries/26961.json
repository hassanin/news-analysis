President Donald J. Trump is imposing new sanctions on the Supreme Leader of Iran and the Office of the Supreme Leader of Iran. This is in response to Iran's recent escalations of aggression towards the United States. The United States is sending a clear message to the Iranian regime that it must end its malign behavior. The statement also calls on Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, change its destructive behavior, respect the rights of its people, and return to the negotiating table in good faith.
