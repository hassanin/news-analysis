The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has launched the second phase of its drug prevention ads campaign called "The Truth About Opioids." This phase is targeted at young adults aged 18-24 and aims to address the knowledge gap on opioid use. The campaign includes a new ad titled "Treatment Box," which features Rebekkah, a 26-year-old undergoing evidence-based treatment for opioid addiction. The campaign uses digital platforms, social media, and television to reach its audience and includes a website, opioids.thetruth.com, that provides information about opioids, the epidemic, and a treatment locator resource. The ONDCP, in partnership with the Ad Council and Truth Initiative, hopes to raise awareness, prevent opioid misuse, and save lives through this campaign.
