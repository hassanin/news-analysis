This executive order, issued on June 19, 2018, focuses on the ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters of the United States. It recognizes the importance of these waters to the economy, security, global competitiveness, and well-being of the country. The order aims to improve public access to marine data and information, coordinate interagency efforts on ocean-related matters, and engage with marine industries, the science and technology community, and other ocean stakeholders. It promotes the coordination of executive departments and agencies to ensure effective management of these waters and provide economic, security, and environmental benefits. The order also emphasizes the need to support the economic growth of coastal communities, promote ocean industries, facilitate the use of ocean-related science and knowledge, and encourage coordination and collaboration among federal, state, tribal, and local governments, marine industries, and other stakeholders. The order establishes an interagency Ocean Policy Committee to oversee these efforts and provide advice to the President and relevant agencies. It also revokes Executive Order 13547, which focused on stewardship of the ocean, coasts, and Great Lakes.
