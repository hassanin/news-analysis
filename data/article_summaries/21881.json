President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Washington due to wildfires that occurred between July 9 and August 5, 2014. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected area, specifically in the county of Okanogan and the Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation. The funding will cover emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Michael J. Hall has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the area. FEMA is currently conducting damage surveys in other areas, and additional counties may receive assistance once assessments are completed.
