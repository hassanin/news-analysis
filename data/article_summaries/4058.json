Yesterday, the White House Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Collaborative held its inaugural meeting. The Collaborative is a group consisting of mayors, law enforcement officials, CVI experts, and philanthropic leaders from 16 jurisdictions. Their goal is to use American Rescue Plan funding or other public funding to increase investment in community violence intervention infrastructure and reduce gun violence.

Over the next 18 months, the Collaborative will work on strengthening and scaling the community violence intervention infrastructure in their respective jurisdictions. They plan to do this through peer-to-peer learning, community-based evaluations, and the involvement of national experts and federal agencies. These experts will provide training and technical assistance to help communities assess their existing public safety systems, identify gaps, and expand programming to save lives.

During the meeting, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice emphasized the historic opportunity that American Rescue Plan funding provides for cities to invest in their community violence prevention and intervention infrastructure. Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez thanked the mayors and other participants for their leadership and highlighted the value of sharing best practices and lessons learned through the Collaborative.

Several mayors in attendance shared their efforts to support community violence interventions using American Rescue Plan funds and expressed how the Collaborative will help strengthen their programs. The community violence intervention experts involved in the Collaborative recognized the significance of this White House initiative.

The meeting included participants from various jurisdictions, although the specific jurisdictions were not mentioned in the article.
