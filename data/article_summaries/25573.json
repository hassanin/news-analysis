The Trump Administration strongly opposes the Schumer-Rounds-Collins Amendment, which aims to change the national immigration policy. The Amendment is criticized for weakening border security and undermining existing immigration laws. The Administration argues that preventing enforcement for those who entered the country illegally before a future date would lead to a surge in illegal immigration. The Amendment is said to undermine the safety and security of American families and hinder economic growth for American workers. The Administration advocates for a safe, modern, and legal immigration system, which includes securing the border with a physical wall, closing legal loopholes, limiting sponsorships to spouses and children, canceling the visa lottery, and finding a permanent solution for DACA. The Administration is committed to resolving the DACA issue but believes that the Amendment would encourage more minors to be smuggled into the United States. The Administration views the proposed Amendment as dangerous and failing to deliver on its promises to the American people. If presented with a bill containing the Amendment, the President's advisors would recommend a veto.
