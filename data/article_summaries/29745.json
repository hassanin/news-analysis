President Donald Trump has requested Congress to consider fiscal year 2018 budget amendments for various departments and agencies, including Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, and Justice. The request also includes amendments for the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and the National Endowment for the Arts. These amendments are necessary to accurately reflect the policies outlined in the FY 2018 Budget. The overall budget authority totals for FY 2018 would not be affected by this request.
