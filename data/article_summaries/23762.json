President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 20 to September 26, 2015, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. The proclamation recognizes the important role that farmers and ranchers play in shaping the progress of the country and the need to safeguard their health and livelihoods. The Federal Government has partnered with farm families, organizations, and businesses to ensure the well-being of those working on farms and has developed nationwide training guidelines to reduce the hazards faced by farmers and ranchers. President Obama urges agencies, organizations, businesses, and extension services to strengthen their commitment to promoting farm safety and health programs, and calls upon Americans to honor and appreciate the contributions of farmers, ranchers, and farmworkers to the nation.
