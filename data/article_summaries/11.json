The background briefing provides a preview of the G7 working session on China. The focus of the session is not to make China the overriding issue, but rather to offer an alternative vision and approach that countries would want to choose. The briefing highlights key areas of focus, including vaccines, infrastructure, and forced labor. The G7 will announce a new global infrastructure initiative called "Build Back Better for the World," which aims to provide a higher-quality choice compared to China's Belt and Road Initiative. The G7 leaders will also discuss concrete actions to address forced labor and call out the use of forced labor in Xinjiang. The briefing also addresses questions about the G7 communiqu√©, the relationship with Vladimir Putin, and the discussion on cyber issues. Finally, the briefing does not confirm the format of the meeting between President Biden and Putin but suggests that more information will be provided soon.
