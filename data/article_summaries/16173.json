The White House has announced that President Obama has submitted the Protocol to the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia to the U.S. Senate for ratification. This is part of the U.S. commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and reducing nuclear dangers globally. The President is eager to work with the Senate to secure ratification of this Protocol, as well as Protocols to the African Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty and the South Pacific Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty. These regional agreements reinforce nations' commitment to not pursue nuclear weapons and the long-standing record of their non-use. Once in force, this Protocol would require the United States to not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states within the Central Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty. The United States also aims to sign the Protocol to the Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty. The U.S. will continue to pursue measures to advance disarmament, nonproliferation, and the peaceful use of nuclear technology in the context of the NPT Review Conference and beyond.
