In this article, White House Deputy National Security Advisor Tony Blinken discusses the efforts made by the administration to provide detailed information to Congress about the chemical weapons attack in Syria on August 21st. He explains that the administration conducted briefings for members of Congress, both classified and unclassified, to present evidence that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons on that date. Blinken emphasizes that the purpose of the military action being proposed is to deter Assad from using chemical weapons again and to degrade his ability to do so, rather than engaging in a large-scale military operation. He also mentions that the administration is open to considering a proposal by Russia for international supervision and control of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, but expresses skepticism about the credibility of the Assad regime.
