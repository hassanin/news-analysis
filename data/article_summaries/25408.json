Senator Rand Paul writes in an op-ed for Fox News that the tax bill currently being debated in the Senate is a true test for his colleagues. He acknowledges that he is not getting everything he wants, but he has fought for and received major changes for the better in the bill. He plans to vote for it and urges his colleagues to do the same. Senator Paul emphasizes the importance of keeping promises to the American people, including cutting taxes and repealing the ObamaCare mandate.
