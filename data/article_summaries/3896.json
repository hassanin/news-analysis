The United States has airlifted over 54,000 pounds of medical items and food aid to Egypt for delivery to civilians in Gaza. This is the first of three planned deliveries, and the supplies are expected to save lives and alleviate suffering. The US government is grateful to Egypt for supporting these deliveries and broader efforts to ensure humanitarian supplies reach Palestinians in need. Over the past seven weeks, the US has been working to address the acute humanitarian needs in Gaza, delivering aid through partnerships with regional partners and international organizations. The ongoing humanitarian pause has allowed for additional assistance to be provided, but more support is needed. The US is committed to sustaining and expanding the international humanitarian response and urging the international community to increase support to the UN Flash Appeal for Gaza.
