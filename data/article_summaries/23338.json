The article discusses President Obama's events in Columbus, Ohio. The President is scheduled to meet with a local family, the Weithmans, in their home for a kitchen table conversation. He will then host a discussion on the economy with families from the area in the backyard. The Weithman family, who own an architecture firm, have been impacted by the economic slowdown but have been able to keep employees and maintain health insurance coverage due to various government policies. The Recovery Act provided COBRA subsidies for Rhonda Weithman when she lost her job, and infrastructure funding helped the firm retain employees. The passage of health care reform also ensures that their son can get health coverage despite his pre-existing condition. Several elected officials, including Governor Ted Strickland and Senator Sherrod Brown, are expected to attend the events.
