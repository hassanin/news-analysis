President Obama's State of the Union address highlighted the need for America to maintain its leadership in a rapidly changing world and outlined a plan to help the country win the future. The plan focuses on innovation, education, building infrastructure, reforming government, and taking responsibility for the deficit. 

In terms of innovation, the President is calling for new investments in American research and development, with a focus on clean energy technologies. He is also proposing measures to ensure that the U.S. is the first country to put 1 million advanced technology vehicles on its roads. 

In the education sector, the President is calling for reforms to raise expectations for schools and students, replacing No Child Left Behind with a new law that rewards success and provides greater flexibility for schools to innovate. He is also pledging to prepare an additional 100,000 science, technology, engineering, and math teachers by the end of the decade. 

In terms of building infrastructure, the President is proposing efforts to repair and rebuild America's roads, bridges, and transit systems. He is also calling for increased access to high-speed rail and high-speed internet. 

The President is also focused on reforming government to make it leaner and smarter. This includes reviewing regulations to remove unnecessary burdens, merging and consolidating federal agencies, and reforming the corporate tax code to eliminate loopholes and lower the corporate rate. 

Lastly, the President recognizes the need for both parties and both houses of Congress to come together to reduce the deficit. He is calling for a five-year freeze on non-security discretionary spending and is proposing reforms to strengthen Social Security. He is also advocating for the end of tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent.
