First Lady Michelle Obama announced that over 125,000 veterans and military spouses have been hired or trained by more than 2,000 businesses through her Joining Forces initiative. These companies have also pledged to hire or train 250,000 more veterans and spouses in the future. This announcement meets President Obama's challenge to hire or train 100,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2013. The First Lady also called on states to pass legislation that makes it easier for military spouses to transfer their licenses or certifications when they move. The number of states with supportive measures in place has more than doubled from 11 to 26 in just six months. The First Lady highlighted the importance of supporting military families and ensuring that their skills are rewarded in the job market. Many companies, including NatLabs, Dupont, and Exelon, have made commitments to hire veterans as a percentage of their workforce. The Military Spouse Employment Partnership is also committed to hiring 50,000 military spouses. A complete list of companies and their commitments can be found on the Joining Forces website.
