President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Indiana due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from March 8-14, 2009. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in affected areas. Federal funding will be available for individuals in 13 counties to assist with temporary housing, home repairs, uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Residents and business owners can begin applying for assistance through DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling FEMA. Regis Leo Phelan has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made if requested by the state and further damage assessments warrant it.
