This article is a presidential proclamation issued by Barack Obama declaring December 2009 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. The proclamation emphasizes the dangers of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and urges individuals, families, businesses, community organizations, and faith-based groups to promote substance abuse prevention and alternative transportation options for those who are impaired. The Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is also mentioned as sponsoring a campaign called "Drunk Driving. Over the Limit. Under Arrest." During this month, law enforcement agencies will increase efforts to stop and arrest impaired drivers. The proclamation concludes by urging all Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired driving.
