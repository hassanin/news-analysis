Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Deputy NEC Director Bharat Ramamurti held a press briefing to discuss the Supreme Court's decision on student debt relief. They expressed disappointment in the decision, which they believe undermines equality and could invite more discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. They emphasized that the administration remains committed to enforcing federal anti-discrimination protections and will continue to push for the passage of the Equality Act. Secretary Cardona outlined the actions the administration is taking to provide debt relief to borrowers, including opening up an alternative path to debt relief, introducing an affordable income-driven repayment plan, and creating an on-ramp for repayment for those who need it. They acknowledged that the regulatory process may take time but reiterated their commitment to providing relief to as many borrowers as possible.
