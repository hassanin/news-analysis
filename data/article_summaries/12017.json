The President made calls to Speaker Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Reid to discuss ongoing negotiations on the Continuing Resolution. The President emphasized the need to cut spending and highlighted progress made in agreeing to $73 billion in spending cuts for this year. He instructed his team to continue working with appropriators over the weekend to resolve the composition of those cuts. The President reiterated opposition to cuts that would undermine economic growth, job creation, and the ability to win the future. He also expressed opposition to using the process to further ideological agendas unrelated to reducing spending or the deficit. The President emphasized the need to reach a final solution quickly to avoid a government shutdown that would harm economic recovery.
