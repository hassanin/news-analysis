During the Biden-Harris Administration's third National Space Council meeting, Vice President Harris announced the United States Novel Space Activities Authorization and Supervision Framework. This new policy complements the National Space Council's legislative proposal, the "Authorization and Supervision of Novel Private Sector Space Activities Act", which was transmitted to Congress in November. The framework aims to provide clear and predictable authorization and supervision for commercial novel space activities, taking into account space safety. It updates the current U.S. commercial space regulatory framework to grant the Departments of Commerce and Transportation further authorities to oversee these activities. The goal is to facilitate innovation and maintain U.S. leadership in the safety, security, and long-term sustainability of outer space activities. The framework also emphasizes ongoing collaboration with the commercial space industry and other stakeholders to align government and private sector approaches and interests.
