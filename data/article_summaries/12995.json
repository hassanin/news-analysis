President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Maine, providing federal aid to supplement recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that occurred from December 12-19, 2010. The declaration allows for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures in certain counties and tribal lands. James N. Russo has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
