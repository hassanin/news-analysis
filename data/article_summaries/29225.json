President Donald Trump has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, transmitting an alternative plan for monthly basic pay increases for members of the uniformed services for 2018. Trump strongly supports the men and women in uniform and believes it is important to rebuild the military's readiness and capabilities. As a result, he has decided to exercise his authority to set the 2018 monthly basic pay increase at 2.1 percent. This decision is in line with Trump's fiscal year 2018 Budget and will not have a significant impact on the government's ability to attract and retain qualified members for the uniformed services. The pay adjustments will take effect on January 1, 2018.
