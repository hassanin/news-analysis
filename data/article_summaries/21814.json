President Obama has designated the Stonewall Uprising site in New York City as the first national monument honoring LGBT rights. The monument will protect the area where, in 1969, a community's uprising in response to a police raid sparked the modern LGBT civil rights movement in the United States. The designation comes just days before the one-year anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing marriage equality in all 50 states. The monument will include Christopher Park, the Stonewall Inn, and the surrounding streets and sidewalks. The National Park Foundation will support the establishment of a local Friends Group to raise funding for the monument. This designation is part of President Obama's efforts to expand opportunities and advance equality for all Americans, including the LGBT community. Throughout his presidency, President Obama has taken various actions to protect and promote the rights of LGBT Americans, such as repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell, ending discrimination in healthcare, and supporting efforts to ban "conversion therapy." The Obama Administration has also engaged with governments around the world to advance the rights of LGBT individuals.
