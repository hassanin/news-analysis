In this press briefing, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany discusses several topics. She starts by announcing that President Trump has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in brokering a peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. McEnany highlights Trump's foreign policy of peace through strength and his achievements in ending endless wars, getting allies to pay their fair share, securing better trade deals, standing up to China, and defeating terrorists.

She then addresses questions about President Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his interviews with journalist Bob Woodward. McEnany defends the President's actions, stating that he expressed confidence and calmness to the American people while taking the virus seriously. She dismisses the accusation that Trump misled the public and highlights his early actions to combat the virus, such as implementing travel bans and mobilizing the private sector for testing and vaccine development.

Other topics discussed include the President's response to protests in Belarus, the drawdown of troops in Iraq, the Supreme Court nominee, and the Winter Olympics in Beijing. McEnany also criticizes a recent article in The Atlantic, calling it a false report based on anonymous sources and questioning the credibility of its author.
