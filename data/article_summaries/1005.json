President Biden held a press conference in the East Room, where he addressed the issue of supply chains and the challenges in getting various goods delivered on time. He mentioned that he had signed an executive order on supply chains in February and that the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, two of the largest ports in America, would begin operating 24/7 to speed up the delivery of goods across the country. Walmart, FedEx, UPS, Target, Home Depot, and Samsung have all committed to increasing their use of off-peak hours to move goods more efficiently. The President emphasized the importance of strengthening supply chains and investing in systems that can withstand disruptions caused by events like the pandemic, extreme weather, cyberattacks, and climate change. He also highlighted the need to make more products in the United States and reduce reliance on other countries. President Biden called for a once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure and people through his infrastructure bill and Build Back Better Act, which would improve ports and transportation systems and support domestic manufacturing.
