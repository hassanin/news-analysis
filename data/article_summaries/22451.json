President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of South Dakota, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that began on March 11, 2009. The declaration allows for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures in various counties and reservations within the state. Nancy M. Casper has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Further designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by damage assessments.
