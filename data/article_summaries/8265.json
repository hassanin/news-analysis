According to a recent report, the US economy is still strong. Inflation has decreased significantly since last year, with non-food and energy inflation reaching its lowest level since September 2021. Despite this, the economy has remained robust, with low unemployment rates and a higher percentage of working-age Americans employed compared to the past two decades. Real wages for the average worker are also increasing, especially for lower-wage workers. The government's approach, known as Bidenomics, aims to grow the economy by supporting the middle class and lower-income households, reducing costs, and making strategic investments in the country.
