The G-20 leaders have agreed to a comprehensive reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that gives emerging market and developing countries more voice and representation in the institution's governance. This reform aims to create a stronger and more credible IMF that reflects the global economy of the 21st century. The reform includes increasing the voting power of under-represented countries, moving Brazil, China, India, and Russia into the top 10 shareholders, protecting the voting share of the poorest countries, maintaining the US veto power, and enhancing emerging market and developing country representation on the IMF's Executive Board. Advanced European countries have also agreed to relinquish two of their seats on the Executive Board to provide more voice for emerging market and developing countries. In addition to governance reforms, the IMF's lending facilities have also been reformed to better prevent crises from spreading and to facilitate a strong global recovery.
