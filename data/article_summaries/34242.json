Today marks the 4th anniversary of the deadly chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed over 1,400 people in Ghouta. This event led to the international effort to destroy over 1,000 metric tons of Syrian chemical weapons. However, on April 4th of this year, Assad demonstrated that he still possesses these weapons and is willing to use them against civilians. It is crucial for the international community to remember these tragic events and to speak and act in unison to ensure that the Syrian regime and any other actors contemplating the use of chemical weapons understand that there will be serious consequences. The United States, along with other nations that have signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, is committed to preventing the use or spread of these weapons. Today serves as a reminder of the importance of this commitment and a call for all countries to stand together and make it clear that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.
