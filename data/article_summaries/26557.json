President Trump gave a speech on infrastructure at Trump Tower in New York City. He discussed the need for reform in the infrastructure permitting process, which currently takes many years and involves multiple agencies. He signed an executive order to streamline the process and reduce the time it takes to get approvals. Trump emphasized the importance of investing in infrastructure to create jobs and improve the country's economy. He also addressed questions about CEOs leaving his manufacturing council and his response to the violence in Charlottesville, stating that he condemned neo-Nazis and white supremacists but also criticized the actions of the "alt-left." He defended his statements and said there were "fine people" on both sides of the protests. Trump expressed confidence in his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and said that he believed race relations in America would improve due to job creation and economic growth.
