The Biden-Harris Administration has launched a website called Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation, which provides real-time data and projections on climate change impacts. The website includes accessible and interactive tools on extreme heat, drought, wildfires, flooding, and other climate-related hazards. It aims to help state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments better track impacts and access federal resources for long-term planning. The website provides maps and charts that show current climate hazards and potential future conditions under different emission scenarios. The tool is seen as a valuable resource for community leaders, emergency managers, and individuals in understanding and responding to climate change impacts in their areas. Additionally, the website identifies disadvantaged communities that may be eligible for federal programs aimed at addressing climate change and environmental problems. Overall, the website provides a comprehensive and science-based approach to understanding and addressing climate change impacts at the local level.
