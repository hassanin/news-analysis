President Trump addressed Americans from the Permian Basin in Texas, emphasizing his administration's efforts to promote American energy dominance. He claimed that upon taking office, he ended the war on American energy by rolling back regulations and unleashing the country's energy resources. The results of this energy dominance include more affordable utilities and gas prices, increased job opportunities, and reduced reliance on foreign energy sources. Shale-driven improvements have also led to a 10% reduction in the global price of oil, resulting in annual savings of $203 billion for American consumers. The United States is now the top producer of oil and natural gas. The Trump administration's energy agenda has also shown positive environmental effects, with pollutant concentrations, such as lead and sulfur dioxide, decreasing since 2017.

President Trump aims to continue driving American innovation in the energy sector for the benefit of consumers, workers, and the environment. The article highlights the contrast between Trump's approach and the desire for more government mandates by the left.
