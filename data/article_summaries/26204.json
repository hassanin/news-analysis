According to an analysis by The Daily Caller, the Trump administration has secured funding for approximately 445 miles of the desired 722-mile border wall. This includes 111 miles of new or replacement wall that is currently being built or in progress. The funding was obtained through Trump's national emergency declaration, which allowed him to tap into various sources such as the Treasury asset forfeiture fund and drug enforcement money. The cost of building the wall is estimated to be around $25 million per mile, and officials believe that approximately 323 miles of additional border wall can be built with the 2019 funds. However, the exact estimate is uncertain due to factors such as terrain.
