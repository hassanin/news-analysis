Manufacturing is experiencing a revival in America, thanks to the efforts of President Trump and his administration. Economic policies such as tax reform and the renegotiation of trade deals have fueled new investments in plants and equipment, resulting in strong economic growth and job opportunities. The manufacturing sector has added 348,000 jobs since January 2017, with job growth in 2018 at the fastest rate since 1995. The U.S. Department of Commerce is actively working to level the playing field for American companies by addressing unfair trade practices and enforcing trade regulations. The department has achieved a 15-year high for trade enforcement cases and has launched numerous investigations into unfair trade practices, particularly from China. Measures, such as tariffs and quotas, have been put in place to protect domestic industries critical to national security. The Trump administration is committed to fighting on behalf of American workers and communities to ensure fair trade practices.
