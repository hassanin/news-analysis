The President's budget includes investments in infrastructure, job training, preschool, and tax cuts. It also focuses on reducing deficits and strengthening the long-term fiscal outlook. The budget proposes a series of measures to create jobs and accelerate economic growth, including a $302 billion infrastructure proposal and investments in research and manufacturing. It also includes measures to expand opportunity for all Americans, such as doubling the maximum value of the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless workers and investing in high-quality preschool. The budget focuses on addressing the primary drivers of long-term debt and deficits, including healthcare cost growth and inadequate revenues. It also calls for pro-growth immigration reform. The President's budget shows a vision for moving the country forward and provides a responsible, balanced, and concrete plan for Congress to consider.
