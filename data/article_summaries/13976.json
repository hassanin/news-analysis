President Obama has announced his intent to nominate three individuals to key administration posts in the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Mark Gaston Pearce, the current Chairman of the NLRB, will be nominated for another term as a member and designated as Chairman. Harry I. Johnson, III, a partner at Arent Fox LLP, and Philip A. Miscimarra, a partner at Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP, will also be nominated as members of the NLRB. President Obama emphasized the importance of the NLRB's role in enforcing workplace protections, upholding workers' rights, and creating a stable workplace environment for businesses. He urged the Senate to confirm these nominees swiftly so that the bipartisan board can continue its work.
