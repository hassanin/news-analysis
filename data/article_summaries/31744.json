President Donald Trump has requested that Congress consider budget amendments for various departments in the FY 2020 Budget. The amendments aim to accurately reflect the policies assumed in the budget. Additionally, the amendments include increased funding for the Department of Education regarding the Special Olympics, the Army Corps of Engineers for the Florida Everglades, the Environmental Protection Agency for the Great Lakes, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for returning US astronauts to the Moon by 2024. The amendments are fully offset and do not change the overall discretionary budget authority requested in the FY 2020 Budget. The President also mentioned that funding for the Refueling and Complex Overhaul of the USS Truman aircraft carrier would be restored, but no new amendments are necessary for this change. The details of the amendments can be found in the enclosed letter from the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
