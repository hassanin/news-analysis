Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, Brett McGurk, recently visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to ensure that the United States is fully supporting the defense of these countries against Iranian-enabled missile and UAV attacks. McGurk reiterated the President's commitment to assisting the defense of U.S. partners and held discussions with diplomatic and military teams in both capitals. He also emphasized the need to apply pressure on the Houthis in Yemen while working towards ending the war through a UN-led effort. Additionally, State Department Special Envoy for Energy Affairs, Amos Hochstein, joined McGurk in Saudi Arabia to discuss strategies for managing potential market pressures resulting from a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.
