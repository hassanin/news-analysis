The article discusses the launch of a new Microfinance Growth Fund for the Western Hemisphere, aimed at addressing the shortage of finance for micro and small businesses in the region. The fund, a partnership between the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and the Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC), will provide stable sources of finance to microfinance institutions and investment vehicles. The initial capital for the fund is $100 million, with a goal of raising $250 million. The fund will make medium and long-term loans to support the growth of micro and small enterprises in Latin America and the Caribbean, as external financing sources contract. The fund will be managed by the MIF, and a request for statements of interest will be launched next month. Leading investors have committed an initial $20 million to the fund, and senior debt will be provided by OPIC and IIC.
