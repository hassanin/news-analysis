The Department of Health and Human Services announced that nearly 13 million Americans selected a 2016 Marketplace plan during the third open enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act. The White House announced that Milwaukee, Wisconsin is the winner of the White House "Healthy Communities Challenge" for successfully enrolling about 38,000 people in the Milwaukee area in a plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Chicago, Atlanta, Detroit, and Oakland rounded out the top five for the challenge. The White House reached out to local officials in each of the 20 participating communities to get their uninsured constituents covered. The lessons learned from these communities will guide enrollment efforts nationwide in the future. The article also highlights some innovative tactics used by participating communities to increase enrollment, such as attending open enrollment events, using non-emergency services lines to inform callers of their ACA insurance options, and creating public service announcements. The success of the Healthy Communities Challenge was measured by the ratio of new plan selections to eligible uninsured individuals in each community.
