The article is a proclamation signed by President Barack Obama on April 1, 2010, regarding Census Day. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of the census in identifying where resources are most needed and guiding the government's response to the changing needs of American communities. It encourages all Americans to fulfill their civic duty by participating in the 2010 Census, as it will help ensure adequate funding for schools, hospitals, senior centers, and other public works. The census will also assist employers in choosing the location of new factories and businesses during the economic recovery. The proclamation acknowledges past issues where minority groups, young people, and low-income residents were undercounted, and emphasizes the need for an accurate and proportional representation in the United States House of Representatives. It assures the public that filling out the 2010 Census is easy, safe, and that the Census Bureau vigorously protects the privacy of participants. By returning the census form by mail, taxpayers' money is saved and all Americans can receive the support they deserve and have a voice and vote in democracy. The proclamation designates April 1, 2010, as Census Day and urges all Americans to commemorate this day by filling out and returning their census forms.
