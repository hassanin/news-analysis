The Biden Administration is facilitating the air shipment of over 4.7 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Bubs Australia infant formula on July 10 and 21. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is organizing a flight for Operation Fly Formula to transport the formula from Australia to Ontario, California, and Columbus, Ohio. The deliveries will include approximately 318,000 pounds of various Bubs Organic and Bubs Goat Milk infant formulas, equivalent to around 4.7 million bottles. The product will be available through national and regional retailers.

In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it would allow Bubs Australia to export additional infant formula into the U.S. Bubs plans to import various standard and specialty formulas, including Bubs Organic Grass Fed, Bubs Supreme A2 Beta-Casein Protein, and Bubs Easy-digest Goat Milk, with a total of over 27.5 million bottle equivalents.

Operation Fly Formula was launched by President Biden to expedite the import of infant formula and ensure it reaches stores quickly. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) are collaborating to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards, enabling faster distribution to store shelves. By July 10, Operation Fly Formula will have transported over 43 million bottle equivalents to the U.S.

The Biden Administration has also taken other measures to ensure an adequate supply of safe infant formula, such as invoking the Defense Production Act, reaching a consent agreement with Abbott Nutrition to reopen their facility in Sturgis, and issuing FDA guidance for the safe importation of formula not currently produced for the U.S. market.
