The White House is criticizing the House of Representatives for voting to restrict a law enforcement tool that the Department of Homeland Security uses to focus on key enforcement priorities such as public safety and border security. The Administration believes that the use of Deferred Action for DREAMers in 2012, which has benefited over 500,000 young people who are Americans in every way except on paper, is the most significant progress made towards immigration reform in years. The statement also criticizes the House for not taking action on an immigration reform bill that would require undocumented individuals to pay taxes, undergo background checks, and comply with the law. The Administration argues that the House's approach is focused on rounding up and deporting 11 million people, separating families, and undermining the DHS' ability to secure the border.
