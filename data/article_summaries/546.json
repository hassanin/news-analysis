On June 3, 2023, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 346, requires the Federal Aviation Administration to establish a task force to provide recommendations for improving Notices to Air Missions. The second bill, H.R. 3746, called the "Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023," suspends the public debt limit until January 1, 2025, and increases the limit on January 2, 2025. The bill also establishes new discretionary spending limits, appropriates funding for the VA Toxic Exposures Fund, rescinds certain unobligated balances, expands work requirements for certain Federal programs, modifies environmental review processes, and terminates the suspension of Federal student loan payments. The President expressed gratitude to Representatives Stauber and DeSaulnier, as well as Senators Klobuchar, Moran, and Capito for their leadership, and thanked Speaker McCarthy, Leader Jeffries, Leader Schumer, and Leader McConnell for their partnership.
