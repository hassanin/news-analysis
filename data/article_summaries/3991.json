President Biden has declared October 2021 as Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month and emphasized the importance of preventing and addressing domestic violence. The Biden-Harris Administration has made ending gender-based violence a strategic priority and has released the National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality, which emphasizes an intersectional approach. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated gender-based violence, and the administration has invested nearly $1 billion through the American Rescue Plan to support domestic violence and sexual assault service providers. The administration is also developing the National Action Plan on Ending Gender-Based Violence and updating the U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally. Efforts are being made to renew and strengthen legislation, such as the Victims of Crime Act and the Violence Against Women Act. The administration calls for a society where domestic violence is not tolerated, survivors are supported, and all individuals can thrive without fear of violence or abuse.
