In a press briefing, Director Mulvaney discusses the FY17 funding bill and the priorities of the Trump administration. He highlights the increase in funding for defense, border security, and school choice. Mulvaney explains that the bill does not include funding for bricks and mortar for the wall, but emphasizes that the administration can still make important improvements to border security this year. He also addresses the funding for Planned Parenthood and Obamacare subsidies, stating that the bill does not address the CSR payments and that the battle to defund Planned Parenthood should be fought through the American Healthcare Act. Mulvaney clarifies that the bill does not affect the deficit and that the funding for the wall in FY18 will be detailed in the upcoming budget proposal. He concludes by urging Republicans to vote for the bill to advance the President's agenda.
