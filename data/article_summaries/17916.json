In this press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest discusses several topics. Regarding the landmark immigration case, Earnest says it is unwise to draw conclusions based solely on the questioning of the justices. He also says that the President's instructions to his national security team have been to reinforce elements of the campaign against ISIL that are showing progress. Earnest confirms that the First Lady will join the President for part of his trip to the UK. On the topic of oil prices, he says that the administration is aware of the fluctuations in the global oil market and their impact on the US economy, but does not comment on the decisions made by individual countries. Earnest also discusses the building of a bridge to Crimea by Russia and the President's phone call with President Putin, saying that President Obama made a forceful case to President Putin that Russia needs to abide by their commitments made in the context of the Minsk talks. He also addresses incidents involving Russian aircraft intercepting US military vehicles, saying that such incidents are not particularly unusual. Regarding the nomination of Merrick Garland for Supreme Court Justice, Earnest states that the President picked the best person for the job and urges the Senate to fulfill their constitutional duty. He also discusses the threat of the Zika virus and the need for Congress to approve funding to combat it. Earnest expresses skepticism about Congress's ability to pass legislation on encryption and criticizes Republicans for trying to gut funding for the IRS. Finally, he acknowledges that there are ongoing problems at the VA and says that while progress has been made, there is still more work to be done.
