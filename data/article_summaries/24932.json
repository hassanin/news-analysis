The White House is taking action to modernize the federal infrastructure permitting process in order to accelerate the construction of major infrastructure projects. The goal is to cut through red tape and make more timely decisions while still protecting communities and the environment. The Administration has already expedited the review and permitting of over 50 major infrastructure projects, and today they are releasing a comprehensive plan to further accelerate and expand these reforms. The plan includes improving interagency coordination, synchronizing reviews, driving accountability and transparency through an online permitting dashboard, and launching an interagency permitting center to institutionalize reform. The Administration is also calling on Congress to pass a robust multi-year transportation bill before the Highway Trust Fund runs out of money this fall. The President’s 2015 Budget includes funding for the interagency permitting center and the expansion of the permitting dashboard. These efforts are part of the Administration’s broader commitment to increase investment in U.S. infrastructure and spur economic growth.
