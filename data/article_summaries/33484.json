On October 20, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to provide the Secretary of Defense with additional authority to manage personnel requirements. This order amends Executive Order 13223 by invoking and making available the authorities under sections 688 and 690 of title 10, United States Code, to the Secretary concerned, subject to the direction of the Secretary of Defense. The order states that it does not impair the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also emphasizes that the order is not intended to create any right or benefit enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities.
