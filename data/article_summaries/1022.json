Ten years ago, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, which prohibited gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members from serving openly, was repealed. This marked a significant step towards equality and opportunity for all in the United States. Over 100,000 service members had been discharged because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, with many receiving "other than honorable" discharges, which denied them important services and benefits. As a Senator and Vice President, Joe Biden supported the repeal of this policy and championed its repeal into law. As President, he is proud to lead an inclusive military that welcomes LGBTQ+ service members and is represented by LGBTQ+ veterans in leadership positions. He appointed the first openly gay Senate-confirmed Cabinet member, Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and repealed the ban on transgender service members during his first week in office. Biden expresses gratitude for the LGBTQ+ service members and veterans who contribute to the strength of the military and emphasizes the need to continue fighting for full equality, including passing the Equality Act.
