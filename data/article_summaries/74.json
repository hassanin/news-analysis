President Biden signed Executive Order 13985, which directed the federal government to advance an equity and racial justice agenda. Over 90 federal agencies, including Cabinet-level agencies, have released Equity Action Plans that outline more than 300 strategies and commitments to address systemic barriers in policies and programs that hinder underserved communities. This is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to promote equity and justice, including a national strategy on gender equity, diversity inclusion in the federal government, environmental justice, and combating discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. The plans aim to expand federal investment and support in communities that have historically faced barriers, such as communities of color, Tribal communities, rural communities, LGBTQI+ communities, people with disabilities, women and girls, and communities affected by persistent poverty. The plans also include strategies to embed equity, racial justice, and gender equality in the daily operations of government.
