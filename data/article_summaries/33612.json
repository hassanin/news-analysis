The U.S. economy created a record 4.8 million jobs in June, bringing the total number of jobs added over the past two months to 7.5 million. This marks the largest monthly job gains in history. The leisure and hospitality industry saw the largest gains, adding 2.1 million jobs, followed by the retail trade industry with 740,000 jobs added. While the speed of the recovery has exceeded expectations, there is still a long way to go as millions of Americans continue to suffer from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate fell by 2.2 percentage points in June to 11.1 percent, but this likely understates the actual progress made due to misclassifications in the household employment survey. The unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans fell by 3.1 percentage points, while for Black Americans it fell by 1.4 percentage points. Despite the positive news, there are still challenges ahead, and efforts should be made to address the needs of those who have been most affected by the crisis.
