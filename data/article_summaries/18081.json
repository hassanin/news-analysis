President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Oregon, ordering federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe winter storms, winds, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred from December 6-23, 2015. The declaration allows for federal funding to be used for emergency work, repairing or replacing damaged facilities, and implementing hazard mitigation measures. The counties of Clatsop, Columbia, Coos, Curry, Lane, Lincoln, Linn, Multnomah, Polk, Tillamook, Washington, and Yamhill are eligible for assistance. Dolph A. Diemont has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
