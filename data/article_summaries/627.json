The article is a declaration by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. of a national emergency in response to hostage-taking and wrongful detention of United States nationals abroad. The President cites the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-taking Accountability Act, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the National Emergencies Act, and other laws as the authority for this declaration. The President states that hostage-taking and wrongful detention undermine the rule of law and threaten the safety of United States nationals and the international political system. The order aims to strengthen the United States Government's efforts to deter these practices and secure the release of those held as hostages or wrongfully detained. It reinforces the roles, responsibilities, and commitments outlined in previous directives and emphasizes interagency coordination, family engagement, and diplomatic tools in securing the safe release and return of United States nationals. The order also seeks to impose consequences on those responsible for hostage-taking or wrongful detention. It includes provisions for the coordination of efforts, reporting requirements, and the blocking of property and interests in property of individuals or entities involved in these activities. The order also suspends the entry of noncitizens determined to be involved in wrongful detentions and provides for the identification of officials of foreign governments involved in such detentions. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury are granted authority to implement the order and take necessary actions to carry out its purposes.
