The federal funding will be available to help with emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures in several counties and cities in Virginia. Donald L. Keldsen has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Further designations may be made in the future based on additional damage assessments.
