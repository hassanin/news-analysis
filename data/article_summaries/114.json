President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed September 24, 2022, as National Hunting and Fishing Day in the United States. The proclamation recognizes the importance of hunting and fishing as time-honored traditions that bring families and friends together, provide sport and leisure opportunities, and contribute to the economy. Hunting and fishing also sustain livelihoods, support over a million jobs, and bring tourism dollars to communities. The future of these activities depends on conserving America's public lands and natural spaces, as biodiversity loss and climate change have made healthy fish and game harder to find. Hunters and anglers have been leaders in conservation efforts, and Federal programs funded by equipment and license sales have contributed over $25.5 billion to State and local conservation. President Biden's Administration has made significant investments in wildlife and habitat conservation efforts and outdoor recreation, including a record investment of $1.5 billion in annual funding. The America the Beautiful Initiative aims to conserve at least 30 percent of the nation's lands and waters by 2030. The proclamation encourages Americans to observe National Hunting and Fishing Day and calls for partnerships to make public lands accessible to all and ensure the health and resilience of outdoor spaces for future generations.
