Over 3,100 public housing authorities in the U.S. have successfully met the funding deadline outlined in the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009. As a result, nearly $3 billion in Public Housing Capital Fund grants awarded through the Recovery Act are being used to make significant improvements to public housing units across the country. This has created or retained nearly 9,000 jobs and developed or rehabilitated 150,000 public housing units in hard-hit neighborhoods. The funds are also allowing housing agencies to address long-standing capital needs, create jobs, and increase energy efficiency. The deadline required that all funding be committed to specific projects or activities one year after it was awarded. Of the $2.985 billion awarded, $2.981 billion has been obligated and $3.246 million was voluntarily returned. The remaining funds are being redistributed by HUD. The Capital Fund Program provides annual funding for public housing authorities to develop, finance, and modernize public housing. The Recovery Act included $13.61 billion for projects and programs administered by HUD, with nearly 75 percent allocated to state and local recipients and the remaining 25 percent awarded through competitive grant programs.
