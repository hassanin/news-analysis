The White House is hosting a Summit on Offshore Wind to promote the development of renewable energy, including offshore wind. The goal is to increase non-hydro renewable energy generation to 20% by 2030. By 2030, offshore wind is projected to supply 22,000 megawatts of clean energy, enough to power 4.5 million homes. The White House is establishing an Interagency Working Group on Offshore Wind to coordinate federal agencies working on offshore wind. The Department of Energy is funding a multi-state project to develop a regional roadmap for offshore wind in the Northeast. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is also working with offshore wind regulators in the UK, Denmark, and Germany to establish an International Offshore Wind Regulators Forum. BOEM has also announced lease auctions for offshore wind development in North Carolina and New Jersey. The National Offshore Wind Strategy will be updated in 2016 to address changes in technology, resource potential, and electricity demand.
