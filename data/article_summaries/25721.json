President Trump's executive order to rescind many of the Obama Administration's energy directives is seen as an early victory in unleashing American energy. The order directs the Environmental Protection Agency to review the Clean Power Plan, which forces states to retire coal plants early.

The article praises Trump for ending punitive policies that harmed the economy with no improvement in global CO2 emissions or temperatures. It also highlights the market forces already reducing coal's share of U.S. electric power and argues for a return to regulatory modesty.
