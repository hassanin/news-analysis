President Obama will be hosting a Healthy Kids & Safe Sports Concussion Summit at the White House on May 29. The summit aims to address the gaps in research knowledge and data on concussions, particularly in youth sports. The President hopes to raise awareness among young athletes, parents, school administrators, clinicians, coaches, and youth sports programs about how to identify, treat, and prevent concussions. The summit will also announce new commitments from both the public and private sectors to conduct additional research in the field of sports-related concussions.
