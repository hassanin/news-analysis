The White House Press Secretary released a statement expressing the President's willingness to engage in a debate regarding the balance between national security and citizen privacy in light of recent unauthorized disclosures. The Administration has taken several proactive steps to advance this discussion, including meetings with oversight boards, public statements, and declassification of certain information. However, the statement opposes the current effort in the House to dismantle a counterterrorism tool, arguing that it is not the result of an informed or deliberative process. The House is urged to reject the Amash Amendment and instead pursue an approach that considers the need for a reasoned review of the best tools to secure the nation.
