President Trump recently held a meeting with top hospital CEOs to discuss healthcare costs and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on the establishment of the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, which involves hospitals lending unused ventilators to other hospitals in need. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will support this initiative by guaranteeing additional ventilators if necessary. The President also mentioned that the US is producing or acquiring over 32,000 ventilators by the end of May, and over 150,000 by the end of the year. The meeting also addressed the distribution of funds to hospitals and healthcare providers as part of the CARES Act. The President praised the efforts of the hospital CEOs and their collaboration in combating the pandemic.
