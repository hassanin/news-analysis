President Barack Obama has issued an Executive Order to improve the security of highly hazardous pathogens and toxins in the United States. The order aims to address concerns regarding the misuse of Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) and ensure their proper security. The order directs the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Agriculture (USDA), along with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to make significant improvements in the structure, coordination, and oversight of activities related to securing BSAT. It also calls for the tiering and potential reduction of the Select Agent List based on the risk posed by each pathogen or toxin. The order establishes a Federal Experts Security Advisory Panel to advise the Select Agent Program (SAP) on security measures and practices. It also emphasizes the need for coordination among federal departments and agencies in overseeing BSAT security and requires a review and alignment of their own policies and practices with the revised SAP.
