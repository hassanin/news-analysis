This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. The President issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13338 in 2004, declaring a national emergency in response to Syria's support of terrorism, occupation of Lebanon, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, and obstruction of efforts to stabilize and reconstruct Iraq. The national emergency has been modified and extended through various executive orders. The regime's brutality and repression of the Syrian people, as well as its support of terrorist organizations, continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The United States condemns the Assad regime's violence and human rights abuses and calls for a political transition in Syria. The United States will consider changes in the Syrian government's composition, policies, and actions in determining whether to continue or terminate the national emergency in the future.
