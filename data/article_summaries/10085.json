President Obama will host the North American Leaders' Summit (NALS) on April 2, 2012, in Washington, DC. The summit will include Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada and President Felipe Calderon of Mexico. The meeting will focus on economic growth and competitiveness, citizen security, energy, and climate change. The leaders will also discuss North America's role in the Americas in preparation for the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia. The last NALS was hosted by President Calderon in 2009, and the previously scheduled NALS in 2011 was postponed due to the death of Mexican Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora.
