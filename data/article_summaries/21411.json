He stated his commitment to protecting a woman's right to choose and acknowledged that while this is a sensitive and divisive issue, there is a united determination to prevent unintended pregnancies, reduce the need for abortion, and support women and families in their choices. The President also called for finding common ground to expand access to affordable contraception, accurate health information, and preventative services. Additionally, he highlighted the need to ensure equal rights and opportunities for women, including access to education, fulfilling careers, fair treatment, equal pay, and the freedom to pursue their dreams.
