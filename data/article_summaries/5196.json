President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared in Executive Order 12170 on November 14, 1979, will continue beyond November 14, 2023. The President cites the ongoing process of implementing agreements with Iran from January 19, 1981, and the fact that relations with Iran have not yet normalized as reasons for the continuation of the national emergency.
