The Presidential Memorandum titled "Student Aid Bill of Rights" outlines the need for stronger protections for student loan borrowers in the United States. It emphasizes the importance of affordable loan repayment and the need for a fair and efficient complaint and feedback system for borrowers. The memorandum directs various government agencies, including the Department of Education, the Treasury, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to develop and implement measures to improve loan servicing, enhance disclosures to borrowers, monitor loan performance, and provide clearer information on borrower rights in bankruptcy. It also aims to protect Social Security benefits for borrowers with disabilities and improve the debt collection process for defaulted loans. The memorandum concludes with general provisions and instructions for implementation.
