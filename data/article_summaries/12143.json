The United States and Japan have released a joint statement expressing their commitment to achieving a world without nuclear weapons. They welcome recent international efforts, such as the United Nations Security Council Summit on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Nuclear Disarmament, and resolutions on nuclear disarmament. They plan to actively work towards creating conditions for achieving this objective while ensuring their national security. The United States seeks early conclusion of a START follow-on treaty with Russia, and Japan supports this progress. They call upon states with nuclear weapons to respect transparency, verifiability, and irreversibility in the process of nuclear disarmament. Both countries reaffirm the importance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and plan to cooperate to strengthen it in the 2010 NPT Review Conference. They also intend to pursue the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty. They aim to enhance a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation and emphasize the need for North Korea and Iran to uphold their international obligations. The governments will cooperate to ensure that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has the necessary resources, authorities, and verification capabilities. They also plan to expand nuclear nonproliferation, safeguards, and security cooperation, including hosting conferences and promoting regional efforts to strengthen nuclear security.
