CVS has announced that they will no longer be selling tobacco products in their stores and will be launching a smoking-cessation campaign. This move is seen as a significant step in promoting a tobacco-free generation and setting an example for others in the industry. The White House has applauded CVS's actions, stating that it will not only help Americans quit smoking but also provide them with the necessary information and support to lead healthy lives and reduce healthcare costs. The government's efforts to combat smoking include signing the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, expanding tobacco cessation coverage through the Affordable Care Act, and increasing cigarette prices through a federal excise tax increase. Although progress has been made in reducing smoking rates, there is still more work to be done, and CVS's announcement is seen as a positive step towards improving the health and well-being of millions of Americans.
