In this statement, President Barack Obama commemorates International Women's Day and highlights the immeasurable contributions that women make to the world. He emphasizes that without women, economies would collapse, political systems would deteriorate, and families and communities would fall apart. However, he acknowledges that in many places, women are still treated as second-class citizens, with their abilities undervalued and their human rights routinely violated. President Obama calls for closing the gap between women's inherent value and how they are treated, specifically by supporting girls' education. He mentions the "Let Girls Learn" initiative launched by himself and Michelle Obama to dismantle the barriers that prevent girls from accessing education. He believes that a world where women and girls are treated as equal to men and boys is safer, more stable, and more prosperous. He concludes by stating that treating women and girls with equality is not just a matter of tangible benefits, but a matter of right and wrong, as they deserve to be treated with full rights and dignity everywhere and every day. The President assures that his administration will continue working towards making this vision a reality.
