On December 10, 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by nations from six continents. This document affirmed that every individual is born equal with inherent rights, and it is the responsibility of governments to uphold these rights. On the anniversary of this milestone, we join together to strive for a brighter future and continue working towards a world where all individuals have the rights they deserve. The desires for freedom and opportunity are universal, and when people can raise their voices and hold their leaders accountable, governments become more responsive and effective. Protecting human rights around the globe extends the promise of democracy and promotes peace. The United States will continue to support those who champion these fundamental principles and will always speak out for the human rights of all individuals. The Obama Administration supports free and fair elections, opposes efforts by foreign governments to restrict freedoms, defends the rights of minorities, calls for the release of unjustly detained individuals, and advocates for equal treatment of the LGBTQ+ community. The United States is also committed to ending human trafficking, protecting refugees, and empowering women and girls worldwide. On Human Rights Day and during Human Rights Week, let us reject hatred and work towards a global community where everyone can achieve their dreams and contribute to humankind. President Barack Obama proclaims December 10, 2014, as Human Rights Day and the week beginning December 10, 2014, as Human Rights Week.
