Vice President Biden spoke with Osama al-Nujaifi, the previous Speaker of Iraq's Council of Representatives, about the United States' support for Iraq in its fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Biden praised Nujaifi for his patriotism in stepping aside as a candidate for a new term as speaker to help move Iraq forward and speed up the government formation process. Both leaders agreed that all Iraqi political forces should work together to form a new government that is widely accepted by the nation.
