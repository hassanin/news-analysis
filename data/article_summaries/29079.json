The Presidential Memoranda on National Space Traffic Management Policy, issued on June 18, 2018, addresses the challenges that arise from the increasing congestion and contestation in space. The United States recognizes the importance of space activities for national security, economic prosperity, and scientific knowledge, and aims to maintain unfettered access and freedom to operate in space. The memorandum outlines the principles, goals, and guidelines for space situational awareness (SSA) and space traffic management (STM) to ensure safety, stability, and sustainability in space operations. It emphasizes the need for improved tracking capabilities, updated orbital debris mitigation guidelines, and standards for safe space operations. The United States aims to lead in SSA and STM science and technology, encourage U.S. commercial leadership in these areas, provide basic SSA data and STM services to the public, improve SSA data interoperability and sharing, develop space traffic standards and best practices, prevent unintentional radio frequency interference, improve the U.S. domestic space object registry, and develop policies and regulations for future orbital operations. The memorandum assigns roles and responsibilities to relevant agencies and emphasizes international engagement and cooperation in promoting safe and responsible behavior in space.
