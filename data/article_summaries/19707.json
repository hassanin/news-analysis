The White House held its final It's On Us Summit, which focused on stopping sexual violence against students. The Summit brought together student leaders, campus, community, business, and media partners, as well as federal colleagues, to discuss the work being done to address campus sexual assault. The White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault presented its final report, which builds on the recommendations and lessons learned from the first report released in 2014. The report highlights the advances made throughout the Obama Administration to address sexual misconduct in higher education and showcases innovative initiatives taken by campuses nationwide. Along with the report, the White House also released a guide for university and college presidents, chancellors, and senior administrators to develop comprehensive responses to sexual misconduct at their institutions. The report emphasizes the importance of university leadership in supporting these responses and championing a culture shift that promotes safe campuses. The It's On Us campaign, launched in 2014, aims to shift the culture around sexual assault through education, engagement, and empowerment. The campaign focuses on consent education, increasing bystander intervention, and creating a supportive environment for survivors. Over the past two years, almost 400,000 people have taken the It's On Us pledge online, and students have hosted almost 2,000 events on over 500 college campuses nationwide. The campaign has 95 partners, including MTV, Snapchat, and Major League Baseball. It's On Us has launched new programs, such as a nationwide Student Engagement Program and a Greek Leadership Council, and plans to continue growing these programs and launching new initiatives and partnerships focused on engaging the athletic and entertainment communities.
