The Ninth Circuit has lifted two district court injunctions and ruled that the Trump Administration can enforce a regulation implementing a statute passed by Congress regarding public charge inadmissibility for aliens. The regulation replaces previous guidance from the Clinton Administration that had narrowed the scope of the statute. However, the ruling has not been able to fully vindicate the rule of law due to the practice of individual district judges issuing nationwide injunctions. While the Ninth Circuit lifted two injunctions within its jurisdiction, two other nationwide injunctions in New York and Maryland prevent the regulation from being applied anywhere, including the Ninth Circuit. This allows any district judge to override the ruling of a Federal court of appeals, undermining the implementation of the law. The article argues that nationwide injunctions pose a grave danger to the rule of law and that the judicial system needs to address this issue.
