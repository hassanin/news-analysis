The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced 150 new grants for its Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program. These grants aim to strengthen community coalitions and reduce substance use among local youth. The DFC-funded coalitions engage various sectors of the community and use environmental strategies to tackle substance use issues. The total federal investment for these grants is $18,749,801. The ONDCP plans to announce additional grants in the future to address emerging drug threats affecting youth. The DFC grant recipients have shown success in reducing youth substance use rates in their communities, as highlighted in the 2018 Executive Summary and End-of-Year Report.
