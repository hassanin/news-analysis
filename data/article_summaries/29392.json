President Donald Trump has vetoed a joint resolution passed by the House of Representatives that aimed to terminate the national emergency he declared regarding the crisis on the southern border of the United States. In a statement, Trump argued that the border remains porous and continues to attract criminal activity and illegal migration. He cited statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including the apprehension of over 76,000 aliens attempting to enter the U.S. in the previous month and the seizure of large quantities of drugs. Trump also highlighted the humanitarian crisis at the border, with migrants experiencing abuse and violence, and the strain on border enforcement personnel and resources. He claimed that the situation constituted a national emergency and argued that the Armed Forces were necessary to address it. Trump viewed the resolution as a threat to national security and returned it to the House without his approval.
