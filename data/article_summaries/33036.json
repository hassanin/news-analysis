President Donald J. Trump is awarding the Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander, to His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait. The Amir has been a strong ally to the United States, providing support during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and the Defeat-ISIS campaign. He has also served as his nation's Foreign Minister for 40 years, playing a crucial role in mediating disputes in the Middle East. The Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander, is a prestigious decoration that is rarely awarded and can only be bestowed by the President. The honor was last awarded in 1991. The Amir's eldest son, Sheikh Nasser Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, will accept the award on behalf of his father in a private ceremony.
