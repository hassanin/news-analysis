The U.S. and 30 other countries have committed to work together to achieve the targets of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). The goal is to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to infectious disease threats. The U.S. has already invested over $1 billion in resources to expand the GHSA in 17 countries and now plans to partner with an additional 13 countries. The targets of the GHSA include preventing outbreaks, detecting and reporting outbreaks, and responding and controlling outbreaks before they become epidemics. The GHSA also aims to counter antimicrobial resistance, prevent the spread of zoonotic disease, improve immunization, establish national laboratory systems, and more. The GHSA Steering Group includes 10 countries and invests in infrastructure, equipment, and skilled personnel across sectors. High-level meetings have been held to announce commitments and progress, and the Netherlands will host the next high-level event in 2016.
