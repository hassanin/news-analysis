The Biden Administration is facilitating the air shipment of approximately 4.9 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Bellamy's Organic infant formula from Australia to Dallas, TX. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is sourcing two flights for Operation Fly Formula, which will transport the formula on September 7 and 16. This initiative aims to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure it meets U.S. health and safety standards. The deliveries will include a total of approximately 330,000 pounds of formula, equivalent to 4.9 million bottles, and the product will be distributed through retailers. The Biden Administration has also taken other actions, such as invoking the Defense Production Act and issuing FDA guidance, to ensure there is enough safe infant formula available for families.
