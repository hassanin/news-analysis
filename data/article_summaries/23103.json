This article discusses the actions taken by the President of the United States to empower American workers with the skills needed for in-demand jobs. The President has directed the Vice President to lead a review of federal training programs to ensure they are job-driven. This review will involve consultations with business and labor leaders, educators, mayors, governors, and congressional officials to identify best practices for job-driven training. The President has also instructed the Secretary of Labor to focus the final $500 million of a community college training fund on job-driven training partnerships between regional employers and national industry associations. The goal is to scale up successful training programs and replicate them nationally. Every state will be awarded at least one grant for community college-regional employer partnerships, with priority given to partnerships that include national industry and employer groups committed to replicating successful models nationwide.
