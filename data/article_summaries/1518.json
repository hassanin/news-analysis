The Biden administration will reconvene the Major Economies Forum on energy and climate change (MEF) at the leader level for the second time. The goal is to strengthen climate ambitions ahead of the COP26 conference in November. The meeting will focus on having candid conversations among world leaders about what more needs to be done before the conference and beyond. The recent release of the IPCC report and President Biden's trip to survey climate-related damage have highlighted the urgency of taking stronger action. The administration is working with the European Union and other countries to significantly reduce methane emissions, which are a powerful contributor to climate change. The meeting will also address climate finance, with the U.S. considering increasing its ambition in this area. The attendees of the meeting have not been finalized, but it will be held at the leader level. The administration supports an in-person COP26 conference, provided it can be done safely and equitably. The biggest challenge going into the conference is ensuring that all major economies come with tangible and concrete actions to address the urgency of the climate crisis. The MEF meeting will focus on stepping up climate ambition and discussing plans for post-Glasgow efforts. The meeting will not have a strong focus on coal, as that is being discussed through other forums such as the G20.
