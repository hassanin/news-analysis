Leaders and organizations from around the world, including the African Union, Arab League, European Union, International Monetary Fund, Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and World Bank, have condemned the military takeover in Sudan and violence against peaceful demonstrators. The UN Security Council has also added its voice to this international chorus. The message to Sudan's military authorities is clear: the Sudanese people must be allowed to protest peacefully and the civilian-led transitional government must be restored. The international community urges Sudan's military leaders to release all those detained and restore the institutions associated with the transitional government. The United States is committed to helping the Sudanese people achieve their goal of a democratic Sudan. They believe in Sudan's economic potential and the promise of its future. The events of recent days are a setback, but the United States will continue to support the people of Sudan and their non-violent struggle for the goals of Sudan's revolution. The foundation for future security and prosperity in Sudan should be freedom, equality, government under the rule of law, and respect for human rights.
