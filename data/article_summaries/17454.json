The White House has issued a notice to continue the national emergency with respect to Iran. The emergency was initially declared on March 15, 1995, due to the threat posed by Iran's actions and policies to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Since then, various executive orders have been issued to impose sanctions on Iran. In 2015, the P5+1 countries, the European Union, and Iran reached a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to ensure that Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful. As a result, nuclear-related sanctions were lifted, but non-nuclear sanctions remain in place. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly verified Iran's compliance with its nuclear commitments under the JCPOA. However, certain actions and policies of the Iranian government continue to pose a threat to the United States. Therefore, the national emergency with respect to Iran will continue for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
