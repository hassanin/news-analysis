The article discusses a statement made by several countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Israel, and the United States, regarding the enhancement of security measures in the maritime supply chain. The countries aim to permanently remove nuclear and radiological materials that are out of regulatory control from the global supply chain and effectively deter, detect, and respond to the trafficking of such materials and weapons through the maritime shipping system. They emphasize the importance of a national-level approach for the prevention, detection, and response to nuclear and radiological materials that are out of regulatory control. The countries commit to maintaining robust radiation detection capabilities at their large container seaports and assisting other states in initiating similar programs. They also plan to hold a workshop in 2016 to enhance measures for detecting and permanently removing nuclear and radiological materials from the global supply chain. Topics for the workshop may include national laws, regulations, procedures, response plans, disposition approaches, targeting and screening, best practices in detection, forensics, law enforcement, and new technologies.
