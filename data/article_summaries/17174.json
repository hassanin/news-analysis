The White House has announced further steps in response to the Russian intervention in Ukraine. These steps include imposing sanctions on 20 Russian officials and designating a bank that holds significant resources associated with the Russian leadership. The President has also signed an executive order that allows for the imposition of sanctions on key sectors of the Russian economy if Russia further escalates the situation. The US is coordinating closely with European and Asian allies and will continue to discuss the costs that can be imposed on the Russian government as well as the support that can be provided to the Ukrainian government. The US is also supportive of the IMF moving quickly with a package to help support the Ukrainian economy and is committed to working with NATO allies to strengthen collective defense. The US is considering providing non-lethal support to the Ukrainian military but is focused on deescalating the situation and stabilizing the Ukrainian economy. The US believes that further escalation by Russia would result in severe consequences and economic isolation for Russia.
