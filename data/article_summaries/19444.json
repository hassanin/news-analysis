On February 4, 2013, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation declaring it the 100th anniversary of the birth of Rosa Parks. The proclamation highlights Parks' historic act of refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white passenger in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955. This act sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a 381-day peaceful protest that led to the desegregation of public transportation in the United States. The proclamation also recognizes Parks' lifelong dedication to civil rights and encourages Americans to honor her legacy through service, community, and education programs.
