The United States is hosting global energy leaders for the first time since the Paris Agreement at the Seventh Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM7) and the inaugural Mission Innovation (MI) Ministerial in San Francisco. The countries are meeting with the goal of accelerating the deployment of clean energy technologies through the CEM and investing in innovation for the technologies of the future through Mission Innovation. The 20 nations and the European Union are announcing their specific plans to double public investment in clean energy research and development over five years, committing to invest nearly $30 billion per year by 2021. In addition, 21 countries, the European Union, nearly 60 companies and organizations, and 10 subnational governments are making more than $1.5 billion in commitments to accelerate the deployment of clean energy and increase energy access. The transition to a clean energy future is inevitable and every sector and every level of government is involved. The clean energy transition is reinforced by findings that renewable energy is expected to grow substantially in the next 25 years. However, global temperatures are expected to continue to rise at an alarming pace, and more action is needed to limit the increase to 2 degrees Celsius. The meeting and announcements are important so that countries can continue to work together to accelerate the transition to the clean energy economy of tomorrow. The article also highlights various commitments and initiatives by governments, organizations, and companies to support clean energy innovation, reduce carbon emissions, improve energy efficiency, and increase access to clean energy.
