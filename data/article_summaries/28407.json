The House of Representatives has passed over 50 comprehensive bills in the last two weeks to combat the opioid and drug demand crisis. President Donald J. Trump and his Administration's work on this issue is supported by complementary legislation from Congress. These bills aim to save American lives through prevention and education, treatment and recovery, and law enforcement and interdiction. The legislation reflects and advances key elements of the President's initiative to reduce drug demand and supply in the nation, making it the most significant Congressional effort against a single drug crisis in US history. The administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress on this issue and urges the Senate to swiftly pass the legislation and get it to the President's desk. Enacting this legislation will be another step in the ongoing effort to end the opioid crisis.
