President Franklin D. Roosevelt's signing of Executive Order 9066 eighty-one years ago led to the wrongful incarceration of 120,000 Americans of Japanese descent. Families were torn apart as men, women, and children were forced to leave their homes, jobs, and communities and were sent to inhumane concentration camps based solely on their heritage. The Supreme Court upheld these unjust policies. Despite this, 33,000 Japanese Americans volunteered or were drafted into the U.S. military during World War II, fighting for the nation's freedom while their own families were confined. This dark period in American history serves as a reminder of the consequences of unchecked racism, fear, and xenophobia. The Federal Government formally apologizes to Japanese Americans for the suffering caused by these policies and commits to preventing a repeat of such injustices.
