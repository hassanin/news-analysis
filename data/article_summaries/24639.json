President Barack Obama has declared that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq will continue beyond May 22, 2016. This emergency was declared in 2003 and is being extended due to obstacles in the reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of peace and security, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in the country. The President believes that these issues continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
