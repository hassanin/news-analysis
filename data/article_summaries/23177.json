The article discusses the U.S.-UK Partnership for Global Development, a collaboration between the United States and the United Kingdom to improve the lives of the world's poorest people. The partnership focuses on various areas, including economic growth, conflict prevention, global health, aid effectiveness, and mitigating climate change.

In terms of economic growth, the UK supports the U.S. Presidency of the G8 in 2012, which focuses on food security, agriculture, and nutrition. In 2013, the UK will host the G8 and together, they aim to strengthen food security in Africa by encouraging investments in agricultural development.

Regarding conflict and fragility, the U.S. and UK have been at the forefront of the international response to the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa caused by drought. They have also endorsed a New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States, working with countries like Afghanistan to develop progress measures for reforms and address fragility.

In the area of global health, the U.S. and UK have secured commitments to exceed the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization's request for funds, allowing for the immunization of millions of children in the poorest countries. They also provide strong support to the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and work towards accelerating progress in maternal and newborn health.

The U.S. and UK recognize the importance of aid effectiveness and have supported international commitments to strengthen the effectiveness of development efforts. They have also established the Open Government Partnership, which promotes transparency and accountability in governments.

Both countries are committed to addressing climate change and supporting initiatives to reduce emissions and increase resilience to climate change in developing countries. They also collaborate on clean energy technologies.

The partnership looks towards the future by embracing new partnerships and innovations. The UK has joined USAID's "Saving Lives at Birth" Grand Challenge for Development and the countries engage with emerging market countries and the private sector to eradicate poverty. They also remain committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and are actively participating in discussions for a post-2015 commitment to ending global poverty.
