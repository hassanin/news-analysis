On June 20, 2018, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at keeping families together at the border while maintaining strong border security. The President stated that he didn't like the sight of families being separated and that the issue of immigration has been neglected for many years. Vice President Pence emphasized that this action allows for the enforcement of the law while keeping families together. Both the President and Secretary Nielsen called on Congress to change the laws in order to secure the borders and address the crisis of illegal immigration. The President mentioned that the word "compassion" is relevant to the situation, but the border will remain tough. He also expressed the intention to go through Congress and work on a more comprehensive immigration bill. The President assured that the border wall with Mexico will be built eventually. He mentioned that Ivanka Trump and his wife feel strongly about the issue of family separation, but they also believe in the importance of not allowing illegal entry into the country.
