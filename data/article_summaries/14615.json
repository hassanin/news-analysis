This article discusses Executive Order 13575, which was issued by President Barack Obama in June 2011. The order establishes the White House Rural Council, which aims to enhance federal engagement with rural communities in the United States. The council is chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture and includes the heads of various executive branch departments, agencies, and offices. Its mission is to coordinate the development of policy recommendations to promote economic prosperity and improve the quality of life in rural America. The council also works to streamline and leverage federal investments in rural areas, increase federal engagement with rural stakeholders, coordinate efforts for the growth and development of regions that encompass both urban and rural areas, and identify and facilitate rural economic opportunities related to energy development, outdoor recreation, and conservation activities. The order emphasizes the importance of rural communities in supplying food, fiber, and energy, safeguarding natural resources, and contributing to science and innovation. It also highlights the need for federal support in expanding access to capital, promoting innovation, improving healthcare and education, and expanding recreational activities in rural areas.
