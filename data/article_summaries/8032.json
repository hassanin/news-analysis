On National Manufacturing Day, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. celebrates American manufacturing and recognizes its significance to the economy and everyday life. He highlights how American manufacturing provides jobs and produces high-quality goods that range from electronics to food to clothing. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the manufacturing sector, resulting in job losses and supply chain shortages. However, American manufacturers and workers stepped up, repurposing their operations to produce essential materials. The pandemic underscored the vulnerability of global supply chains, prompting President Biden to prioritize building resilient supply chains in the United States to enhance national and economic security. He signed an Executive Order to support manufacturing, rebuild the industrial base, and strengthen supply chains while creating good-paying, union jobs. The President also emphasizes the importance of investing in clean energy manufacturing to revitalize the industry, create jobs, and promote environmental sustainability. The government's role as a major buyer in markets for goods and services is highlighted as an opportunity to support American companies and manufacturing by enforcing the Buy American Act. President Biden has also invested in programs to strengthen STEM education, infrastructure, technology hubs, and economic opportunities in communities across the country. As the nation recovers from the pandemic and Americans return to work, there will be numerous opportunities in the manufacturing industry. National Manufacturing Day is a commitment to supporting current manufacturers and workers while building a future that is made in America.
