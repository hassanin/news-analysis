President Obama has granted commutations to 102 individuals who were serving prison sentences for drug-related offenses. The commutations vary in length, with some sentences being reduced to expire as early as February 3, 2017, and others being reduced to expire on October 6, 2018. The individuals had been convicted of offenses such as conspiracy to distribute drugs, possession with intent to distribute drugs, and possession of firearms in relation to drug trafficking. The commutations were granted on the condition that the individuals enroll in residential drug treatment programs.
