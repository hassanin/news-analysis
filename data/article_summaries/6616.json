In a speech delivered at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, President Joe Biden announced that the American unemployment rate has dropped below 5 percent for the first time since March 2020. The current rate stands at 4.8 percent, which is a significant improvement since Biden took office. The unemployment rate for African Americans has fallen below 8 percent for the first time in 17 months. The President highlighted the drop in long-term unemployment, with 496,000 jobs being added, the second-largest single-month drop on record. He also mentioned the increase in average wages and the lowest number of layoffs and job reductions since 1997. Biden acknowledged the progress made in the fight against COVID-19, with over 186 million Americans fully vaccinated and a 40 percent decrease in cases in the past month. He emphasized the need for further investments in physical infrastructure and the American people, including early childhood education, post-high school degree attainment, and clean energy industries. These investments are expected to lead to higher GDP, job growth, and lower unemployment. Biden called on Americans to seize the opportunity for progress and competitiveness rather than complacency.
