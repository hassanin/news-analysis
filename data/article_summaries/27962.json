A recent paper from the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) contradicts the media's claims that prescription drug prices are rising. According to the paper, under President Trump, prescription drug prices have been decreasing at rates not seen since the 1960s. In the eight years prior to Trump's inauguration, prices increased by an average of 3.6% per year, but now they have seen year-over-year declines in nine of the last ten months, with a 1.1% drop as of the most recent month. In June 2019, there was even a 2.0% year-over-year decline, the largest since 1967. The media's narrative about rising drug prices is misleading because it often focuses on list prices, brand name drugs, or drugs with recent price increases, while ignoring discounts, rebates, and generic drug options. The CEA relies on the prescription drug component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI-Rx) to accurately measure average prescription drug prices. Enhanced competition from generic drugs is also contributing to falling prices. The Trump Administration is working on further reforms to lower prescription drug prices.
