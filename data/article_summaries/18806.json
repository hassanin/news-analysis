On December 15, 2010, the President signed three laws into effect. The first law, H.R. 6118, designates a United States Postal Service facility in Washington, D.C. as the "Dorothy I. Height Post Office." The second law, H.R. 4994, known as the "Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010," delays a reduction in Medicare physician payments for one year and extends other expiring Medicare and Medicaid payment provisions. It also makes changes to limits on excess health insurance tax credits and includes other clarifications and adjustments to Medicare and Medicaid. The third law, S. 2847, also known as the "Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act" or the "CALM Act," requires the Federal Communications Commission to regulate the volume of audio on commercials transmitted by television broadcast stations, cable operators, and other multichannel video programming distributors.
