Today marks the 33rd anniversary of the terrorist attack on Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. A total of 270 innocent lives were lost in this act of terrorism, including 190 Americans. Among the victims were Syracuse University students, business travelers, families on holiday, and Scottish residents. On this day, we remember the victims and express gratitude to our Scottish partners for their ongoing pursuit of justice. We also acknowledge the resilience and determination of the families and friends who have fought to honor their lost loved ones. This tragedy serves as a reminder that terrorism has no place in our world, and we must remain united in our efforts to combat it.
