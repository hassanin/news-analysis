President Obama has appointed Major General Scott Gration as the U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan. Sudan is a priority for the Obama Administration, as it is currently experiencing a worsening humanitarian crisis. The President intends to work with the international community to end the suffering in Sudan by supporting the deployment of a joint African Union/United Nations peacekeeping force and negotiating a political solution for Darfur. The Sudanese government's decision to expel humanitarian relief organizations will be held accountable for the lives lost. The Obama Administration will also work to ensure the full implementation of Sudan's Comprehensive Peace Agreement. President Obama has a personal relationship with General Gration and believes he is well-equipped for this assignment, which demonstrates the administration's commitment to supporting the people of Sudan and seeking a lasting settlement to the violence.
