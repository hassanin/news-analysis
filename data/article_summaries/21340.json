President Barack Obama transmits a proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the US and the UAE Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy to the Congress. The Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and other applicable laws. It aims to advance nonproliferation and foreign policy interests of the United States. The UAE has committed to relying on existing international markets for nuclear fuel services instead of pursuing enrichment and reprocessing. The Agreement includes provisions for termination if the UAE violates its commitment, as well as nonproliferation features such as the removal of special fissionable material if necessary and ensuring cooperation terms are no less favorable than those with other non-nuclear-weapon States in the Middle East. The Agreement also requires the UAE to bring into force the Additional Protocol to its safeguards agreement before the US licenses exports of nuclear material, equipment, components, or technology. The proposed Agreement does not affect the inalienable rights of the US and the UAE under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Agreed Minute to the Agreement provides US prior approval for the UAE to retransfer nuclear material subject to the Agreement to France and the United Kingdom, subject to specified conditions. President Obama's Administration is prepared to begin consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, followed by a 60-day period for review by Congress.
