The press briefing began with a statement from White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, announcing that Seattle has been "liberated" from the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), which she referred to as a "failed four-week Democrat experiment by the radical left." She emphasized that law and order is essential and that peace in the streets will be secured. McEnany contrasted President Trump's vision of law and order with the failed CHAZ experiment and criticized Democrat politicians for their passivity in the face of anarchy.

McEnany also discussed the dismantling of the Black House Autonomous Zone (BHAZ) across from the White House and the arrest of anarchists involved in rioting and destruction of federal property. She mentioned that there are currently 200 open domestic terrorism investigations. 

During the Q&A portion of the briefing, McEnany was asked about the alleged Russia plot and whether it is considered a hoax. She explained that unverified intelligence is immediately communicated to ensure troops' safety but is not briefed up to the President until it is verified. She stated that the President has confidence in the intelligence community's findings and conclusions about Russia.

McEnany was also asked about the President's recent remarks on race, including his description of "Black Lives Matter" as a symbol of hate. She defended the President's position, stating that he supports the sentiment that all black lives matter but does not agree with an organization that exhibits hate towards police officers.

Other topics covered in the briefing include the President's views on the coronavirus pandemic, the banning of Chinese apps in India, the President's stance on Israel's plan to annex parts of the West Bank, and the USMCA trade deal taking effect.
