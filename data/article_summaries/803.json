The Biden-Harris Administration has released a set of analyses that prioritize addressing the climate crisis as a core element of national security and foreign policy. The analyses include the first-ever National Intelligence Estimate on Climate Change, which highlights the increasing risks to U.S. national security interests and the geopolitical tensions that may arise as countries respond to climate change. The Department of Defense has also conducted a Climate Risk Analysis, which focuses on integrating climate considerations into strategic planning, budgeting, and engagements with allies. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security has developed a Strategic Framework to Address Climate Change, emphasizing the need to increase resilience and respond to climate-driven emergencies. Finally, a report on the Impact of Climate Change on Migration acknowledges the importance of managing migration as a response to climate threats and highlights the need for coordination among various government agencies. These initiatives reflect the administration's commitment to evidence-based decision-making and the recognition of the urgent need to address the climate crisis.
