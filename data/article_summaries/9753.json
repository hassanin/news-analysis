President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of West Virginia due to severe storms and straight-line winds that occurred between June 29 and July 1, 2012. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, as well as the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in various counties across West Virginia. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Dolph A. Diemont has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made later if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
