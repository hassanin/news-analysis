The United States and India have reached an important breakthrough on the implementation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. This agreement will lower trade costs for both developed and developing countries. President Obama and Prime Minister Modi had extensive discussions on this issue and appreciate the personal leadership shown by Prime Minister Modi. This breakthrough will also strengthen the multilateral trading system and support ongoing work in areas such as food security. In addition to this agreement, there have been recent breakthroughs in the WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, which will expand opportunities for American businesses and workers and promote global growth.
