The Obama Administration has announced that it will not allow infrastructure funds to remain unused due to stalled earmark projects. The administration is making over $470 million in unspent earmarks immediately available to states for projects that will create jobs and improve transportation. President Obama has vowed to veto any bill with earmarks and supports legislation to permanently ban them. However, there are still $473 million in highway earmarks from FY2003-2006 appropriations acts that remain unspent. States will now have the ability to use these funds on eligible transportation projects. They must identify the projects by October 1 and obligate them by December 31, 2012. Funds not used by the deadline will be redistributed to states in FY 2013. A list of available funds by state can be accessed through a provided link.
