The Dutch Safety Board has released an investigatory report on the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. The report confirms that the aircraft was shot down by a surface-to-air missile fired from separatist-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine. The report serves as a basis for further investigations to identify those responsible for the deaths of the 298 innocent people on board. The United States maintains its support for the work being conducted by the countries of the Joint Investigation Team and will fully support all efforts to bring those responsible to justice. The victims and their loved ones remain in our thoughts and prayers.
