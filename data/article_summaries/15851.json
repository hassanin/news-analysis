President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring September 11, 2015, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. This day commemorates the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, in which nearly 3,000 people lost their lives. The proclamation calls on all Americans to observe this day with acts of selflessness and charity, as a way to honor the victims and their families. The proclamation also encourages the display of the American flag at half-staff and the participation in community service. The President urges the people of the United States to observe a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, the time when the first plane struck the World Trade Center.
