National Economic Council (NEC) Director Brian Deese, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, and senior Administration officials recently met virtually with leaders and advocates to discuss climate-related financial risks. The officials highlighted the risks posed by climate change, including physical risks from severe weather events and transition risks associated with the global shift to a net-zero economy. They emphasized President Biden and Secretary Yellen's commitment to increasing transparency around these risks and implementing the executive order on tackling the climate crisis. The order includes developing a climate finance plan, assisting developing countries in reducing emissions, protecting ecosystems, building resilience, and promoting climate-aligned investments. The officials appreciated the insights and perspectives shared by the group regarding advancing transparency and disclosure around climate-related financial risk.
