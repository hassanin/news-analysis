President Donald Trump has submitted amendments to the Treaty on Fisheries between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America to the Senate for ratification. The amendments aim to update the terms and conditions of the treaty to enhance cooperation between the parties and stakeholders. The treaty allows US purse seine vessels to access fishing waters under the jurisdiction of 16 Pacific Island countries and promotes positive relations with these countries. The amendments have the support of both the Pacific Island parties and US industry stakeholders. Changes to the treaty's implementing legislation will be submitted separately to Congress. President Trump recommends that the Senate consider and ratify the amendments.
