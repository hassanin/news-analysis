The White House is holding a meeting with senior administration officials and stakeholders to discuss the importance of fixing the broken immigration system in America. The meeting will focus on the economic and security needs of the country. The President will also encourage a constructive national conversation on immigration and work towards a bipartisan consensus in Congress. The meeting will be followed by a media availability session. The administration officials attending the meeting include Attorney General Eric Holder, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, and other key figures. Stakeholders attending the meeting include representatives from various organizations and sectors. The President remains committed to fixing the broken immigration system through comprehensive immigration reform. This reform is based on principles of responsibility and accountability, such as securing the borders, holding businesses accountable for hiring undocumented workers, and requiring accountability from those living in the US illegally. The President also aims to strengthen the economy by creating a legal immigration system that meets the country's diverse needs. The Obama Administration has dedicated significant resources to secure the borders, improve interior and worksite enforcement, and enhance the legal immigration system. The administration has seen success in decreasing illegal border crossings, increasing criminal deportations, and improving the efficiency of the legal immigration process. However, comprehensive reform is still needed to ensure responsibility and accountability from all stakeholders involved.
