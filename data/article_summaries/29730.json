President Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Vermont and authorized Federal assistance to aid in recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that occurred from June 29 to July 1, 2017. The Federal funding will be available to the state, eligible local governments, and certain nonprofit organizations for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures. Mark H. Landry has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, and additional designations may be made if requested by the state and further damage assessments warrant it.
