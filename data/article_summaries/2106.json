The Biden Administration has released a technical assistance guide to help state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments access and deploy infrastructure resources provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The guide highlights over $700 million in funding across more than 65 technical assistance programs. The White House Infrastructure Implementation Team has also engaged with philanthropic, labor, and nonprofit organizations to create a pipeline for communities to access federal infrastructure funding. Over 90% of the funding from the infrastructure law will be deployed by non-federal partners. The guide aims to ensure that all communities have the resources to apply for and deploy infrastructure projects. The Administration has already allocated more than $110 billion to states and communities for various infrastructure projects, with an additional nearly $100 billion in funding availability notices for competitive programs. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law aims to rebuild roads and bridges, replace lead pipes, provide clean energy, expand internet access, and prioritize equity and resilience to climate change.
