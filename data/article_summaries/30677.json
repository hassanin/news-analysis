The Senate has confirmed Judge Amy Coney Barrett as the 115th Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court. Barrett has a strong record of upholding the U.S. Constitution and has been praised for her principled and independent-minded approach to the law. She has made it clear that she will not legislate from the bench and believes that policy decisions should be made by the elected branches of government. Barrett's nomination has been supported by her former law clerks and colleagues at Notre Dame Law School.
