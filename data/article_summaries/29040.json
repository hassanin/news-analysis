In this article, Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, discusses the need to restore integrity to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and move people towards self-sufficiency. Perdue argues that the original intent of welfare reform in 1996 was to provide a second chance, not a way of life. However, administrative flexibility has watered down this ideal over time. Perdue states that at a time of low unemployment rates and ample job opportunities, able-bodied individuals who are not working or seeking work should enter or reenter the labor force. He points out that millions of people who could work are still receiving SNAP benefits due to permissive regulations that allow states to grant waivers. Perdue emphasizes that President Trump has directed him to propose regulatory reforms to ensure that those who are able to work do so in exchange for their benefits, restoring the dignity of work and being respectful of taxpayers. He concludes by stating that while Americans are generous and believe in helping their fellow citizens, SNAP was never intended to be a way of life, and it is important to assist people towards independence and self-sufficiency.
