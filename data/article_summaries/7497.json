President Joe Biden commemorated the 31st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in a ceremony at the Rose Garden. He praised the bipartisan effort that led to the passage of the ADA and acknowledged the advocates who fought for disability rights. President Biden highlighted the progress made under the ADA but also acknowledged that there is still work to be done to ensure equality and opportunity for all Americans with disabilities. He discussed his administration's commitment to advancing equity and supporting people with disabilities, including through the American Rescue Plan and the proposed Better Care Better Jobs Act. Additionally, President Biden announced a new effort to provide support and resources to Americans with long-term effects of COVID-19, which can sometimes rise to the level of a disability. The President signed a proclamation marking the anniversary of the ADA and was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and other advocates and lawmakers.
