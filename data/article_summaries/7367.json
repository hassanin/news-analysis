Today marks the 32nd Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a landmark civil rights law that promotes inclusion and access for disabled Americans. The ADA focuses on four core outcomes: full participation, equal opportunity, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency. It prohibits discrimination based on disability in various areas such as public accommodations, employment, transportation, and community living. The law also provides recourse for individuals who have faced discrimination.

Although significant progress has been made since the ADA was signed, there is still more work to be done to fully realize its promise. In recognition of this anniversary, President Biden signed a proclamation, and Vice President Harris is meeting with disability advocates. The discussions will cover reproductive rights and the potential impact of overturning Roe v. Wade on people with disabilities.

Over the past year, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken additional steps to advance equity for Americans with disabilities. These steps include expanding employment opportunities, ensuring access to educational programs and supportive services, securing access to affordable healthcare, housing, transportation, and broadband, promoting full inclusion of people with disabilities in the federal government, enforcing their civil rights, protecting and strengthening economic security, advancing global disability rights, and increasing access to democracy for voters with disabilities.
