President Obama has signed the "Ensuring Access to Pacific Fisheries Act" into law. The act implements three international treaties aimed at promoting sound fishery management and combating illegal fishing practices. The United States will be represented on the North Pacific Fisheries Commission by five commissioners, including two appointed by the President and three chairpersons selected by fishery management councils. However, there are constitutional concerns regarding allowing regional chairpersons to represent the United States on the commission. The executive branch will work to address these concerns while following the intent of Congress.
