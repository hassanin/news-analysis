This article is a presidential memorandum from March 15, 2013, regarding Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Liberians in the United States. It explains that since 1991, the US has provided a safe haven for Liberians who fled their country due to armed conflict and civil strife. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was granted to these individuals, but it ended in 2007 when conditions in Liberia improved. However, President Bush deferred the departure of Liberians originally granted TPS, and this grant was extended until March 31, 2013. The memorandum states that there are compelling foreign policy reasons to further extend DED for Liberians currently residing in the US. Under this grant of DED, the removal of any Liberian national or person without nationality who last resided in Liberia will be deferred for 18 months. This only applies to individuals who have continuously resided in the US since October 1, 2002, with exceptions outlined in the memorandum. The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to implement this deferral of enforced departure and authorize employment for eligible Liberians for 18 months from March 31, 2013. The memorandum is signed by President Barack Obama.
