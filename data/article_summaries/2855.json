Yesterday, the Office of Public Engagement, Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, and Centers for Disease Control Prevention held a stakeholder briefing to discuss strategies for protecting Americans during the upcoming fall and winter respiratory virus season. This year, there are three vaccines available to protect against flu, COVID-19, and RSV. Administration officials recommended that people get vaccinated in October, especially before the holiday season when gatherings with family and friends are more likely. They also reminded stakeholders to order four free COVID-19 tests per household on COVIDTests.gov. The officials addressed questions from stakeholders about where to find information on getting the updated COVID-19 vaccine and the efforts to administer vaccines in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The officials expressed gratitude for the stakeholders' leadership in their communities and emphasized their role as trusted messengers in promoting vaccination, testing, and treatment to save lives and enhance the quality of life in the country.
