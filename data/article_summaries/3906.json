On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which led to the unjust incarceration of approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. This order and the subsequent actions by the Federal Government are considered one of the darkest chapters in American history. Japanese Americans were forcibly removed from their homes and communities, without due process, and subjected to harsh and overcrowded conditions in incarceration camps. They lost their homes, businesses, property, savings, and most importantly, their liberty and fundamental freedoms. The incarceration of Japanese Americans serves as a reminder of the tragic consequences that arise when racism, fear, and xenophobia are allowed to prevail. The article emphasizes the importance of acknowledging this shameful past, learning from it, and ensuring that such un-American acts are never repeated. It recognizes the intergenerational trauma caused by the incarceration and highlights the courage and resilience of Japanese Americans who formed powerful communities despite the injustice they faced. The article also acknowledges the bravery of civil rights leaders and the efforts to seek redress and reparations for the Japanese American community. It mentions the exclusion of Japanese Latin Americans from the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which provided reparations. The National Park Service preserves several Japanese American incarceration camps as tangible reminders of history, promoting reflection and learning about the injustices born of prejudice. The proclamation by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. designates February 19, 2022, as a Day of Remembrance of Japanese American Incarceration During World War II, calling upon the people of the United States to commemorate the injustice, honor the sacrifices made, and commit to eradicating systemic racism and healing generational trauma in communities.
