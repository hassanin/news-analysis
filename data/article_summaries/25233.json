In 2012, Caitlan Coleman and Joshua Boyle were taken captive by the Haqqani network, a terrorist organization with ties to the Taliban. Coleman gave birth to three children while in captivity. The United States government, with the help of the Pakistani government, secured the release of the Boyle-Coleman family from captivity in Pakistan. This is seen as a positive moment for the relationship between the US and Pakistan, as it shows Pakistan's willingness to provide security in the region. The hope is that this cooperation will continue to secure the release of other hostages and in future joint counterterrorism operations.
