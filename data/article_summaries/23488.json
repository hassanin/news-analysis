In this letter from President Barack Obama, he requests that Congress consider budget amendments for various departments and programs for the fiscal year 2017. The departments include Agriculture, Defense, Education, Homeland Security, State, Transportation, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia, the Surface Transportation Board, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. There is also an amendment for the Federal Trade Commission. These amendments would increase the overall discretionary budget authority by $4 million. Additionally, there are amendments for the Legislative Branch, which would decrease the overall discretionary budget authority by $25 million. The Department of Energy also has amendments, including initiating the modernization of Strategic Petroleum Reserve infrastructure and funding enhancements for marine terminal distribution capacity. These initiatives would be funded by the sale of crude oil from the Reserve. There are also amendments to offset settlement costs related to incidents in 2014 at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. Overall, these amendments would decrease the overall discretionary budget authority by $21 million. The details of the amendments are provided in the enclosure from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
