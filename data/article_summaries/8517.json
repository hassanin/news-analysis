On September 23, 2001, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the acts of terrorism committed by foreign terrorists, including the 9/11 attacks. This declaration was made under Executive Order 13224 and was aimed at addressing the threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. On September 9, 2019, President Biden signed Executive Order 13886 to strengthen and consolidate sanctions against international terrorism and to further address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13224. The President has now decided to extend the national emergency for another year, citing the ongoing threat posed by individuals who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism. This extension is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will remain in effect beyond September 23, 2021. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
