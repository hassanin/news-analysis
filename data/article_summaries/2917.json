President Biden believes that investing in America, growing the economy from the bottom up and middle out, lowering costs for families, and reforming the tax code are economic and fiscal imperatives. He believes that strong and shared growth benefits the economy and leads to better fiscal outcomes. President Biden's budgets have consistently paid for his investments and improved the nation's fiscal outlook. He inherited a large deficit from his predecessor due to a reckless and unpaid for tax cut that favored the wealthy and large corporations. However, under President Biden's responsible approach, the deficit has fallen by $1.7 trillion in the first two years of his administration. The President's Budget aims to reduce the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the next decade while lowering costs for families and protecting vulnerable Americans. This will be achieved by ensuring the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share and ending wasteful special interest giveaways. The Budget also aims to stabilize deficits as a share of the economy and keep the economic burden of debt within historical norms. It achieves this by making the tax system fairer, ending special interest giveaways, and reducing wasteful spending. The President's Budget takes steps to make the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share and eliminate tax cuts for the rich and corporations. In contrast, Republicans in Congress have proposed tax giveaways to the rich and large corporations without specifying how they would pay for them or reduce the deficit. Their past proposals have included cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and other programs. Instead of making reckless cuts to essential programs, the President's Budget focuses on making the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share and ending wasteful spending.
