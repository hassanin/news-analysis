President Obama met with several working families to discuss his commitment to a simpler tax code that rewards work and supports economic growth. The families included the Wrights, who both work and qualify for the Making Work Pay tax credit, the Kirkwoods, who are living paycheck to paycheck and also qualify for the Making Work Pay tax credit, Clark Harrison, a first-time home buyer who benefited from the home-buyers tax credit, Alan Dale Givens, a heating/plumbing/air-conditioning contractor who has seen an increase in business due to tax incentives, Latoya Malone, who was able to purchase a home with the help of the home-buyers tax credit, Zoraida Cruz, a single mother who discovered she was eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit and used the savings to pay off bills, and Catrena Hunter, a clerical assistant who used the Earned Income Tax Credit to purchase clothing and school supplies for her children.
