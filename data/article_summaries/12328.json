The White House has announced that the national emergency with respect to North Korea will continue beyond June 26, 2016. This emergency was initially declared in 2008 and has been expanded and addressed further in subsequent executive orders. The decision to continue the national emergency is based on the existence and risk of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, the destabilizing actions and policies of the North Korean government, including its pursuit of nuclear and missile programs, and other provocative and repressive actions. The White House considers these factors to be an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
