At the Summit of the Americas, the United States announced the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, which aims to drive sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the hemisphere. Eleven countries, including Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay, have joined the initiative. Together, they represent about 90 percent of the Western Hemisphere's GDP and nearly two-thirds of its population. The partnership will focus on boosting competitiveness, building resilient supply chains, creating quality jobs, combating climate change, and revitalizing economic institutions. It aims to improve the lives of people in the region and promote economic growth from the bottom up and middle out. The Americas Partnership is open to all countries that share the same values and vision for a prosperous hemisphere. Future discussions among Americas Partnership leaders will explore ways to deepen economic cooperation and leverage strengths through the initiative.
