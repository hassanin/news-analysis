The Biden-Harris Administration has made reopening schools safely a top priority. Through the American Rescue Plan and a comprehensive COVID-19 response, the administration has provided unprecedented resources to schools. As a result, all schools were open during the past school year. Now, as another school year begins, the administration is providing key supports and guidance to protect students, teachers, and school communities from COVID-19. These include promoting COVID-19 vaccinations, providing robust access to testing, and improving indoor air quality. The administration will continue to work with the CDC to ensure schools have the latest guidance on COVID-19 mitigation and can remain open for full-time, in-person learning. Additional protections will be provided for students who are immunocompromised or have complex medical conditions.
