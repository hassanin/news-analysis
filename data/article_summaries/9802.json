The article is a message from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the national emergency with respect to Burma will continue beyond May 20, 2012. The Burmese government has made progress in areas such as releasing political prisoners and engaging in cease fire talks, but the situation in Burma still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Concerns include remaining political prisoners, ongoing conflict, and human rights abuses in ethnic areas. As a result, the President has decided to maintain sanctions in response to this threat.
