The Biden Administration is taking various measures to address gasoline shortages and keep fuel flowing to pumps. The Department of Energy has authorized a crude oil exchange of 1.5 million barrels with ExxonMobil Baton Rouge from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to address supply disruptions and support refiners in the region. This is the first exchange from the SPR in four years, demonstrating the President's commitment to using all available authorities to aid response and recovery activities. Other actions taken include providing flexibilities for truck drivers to deliver fuel, issuing waivers to expand fuel supply, and waiving penalties for the use of dyed-diesel fuel on highways in the affected region. The President has also authorized actions to assist with power restoration efforts in the Gulf Coast, where some gas stations are still without electricity. The Federal Government is fully dedicated to helping Americans in the aftermath of the storm.
