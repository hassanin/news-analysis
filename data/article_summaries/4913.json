On June 30, 2021, the President signed H.R. 2441, also known as the "Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act of 2021." This law mandates the Department of Veterans Affairs to expand the Rural Access Network Growth Enhancement program. The expansion aims to improve mental health services for rural veterans. Several representatives and senators, including Cindy Axne, Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Randy Feenstra, Tim Ryan, Ed Case, Jon Tester, Jerry Moran, and Joni Ernst, were acknowledged for their leadership in this effort.
