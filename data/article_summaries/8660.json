In a speech before heading to Philadelphia, President Biden announced that the state of the Union and the economy is strong. He shared that the economy created 517,000 jobs in January, bringing the total number of jobs created since he took office to 12 million, the strongest two years of job growth in history. The unemployment rate also fell to 3.4 percent, the lowest in 54 years, with record lows for Black and Hispanic unemployment. Inflation has been decreasing, while wages for workers are increasing. The President emphasized that his economic plan is working and debunked critics who doubted its effectiveness. He highlighted the need to continue lowering costs for families, investing in infrastructure, and revitalizing communities. The President declined to answer questions on other topics and dismissed blame for inflation, stating that the economic challenges were already present when he assumed office.
