Vice President Harris announced that 2.5 million Americans have signed up for health insurance during the 2021 Special Enrollment Period. This special enrollment period was opened by the Biden-Harris Administration to provide all Americans with the opportunity to sign up for health insurance. The Vice President emphasized that health care is a right, not a privilege, and that every American should have access to quality and affordable health care. The American Rescue Plan has made health insurance more affordable by providing enhanced tax credits, resulting in lower premiums for nine million Americans who purchase coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Since April 1, over one-third of new and returning HealthCare.gov customers have found plans with premiums of $10 or less per month, and returning customers have seen their premiums drop by an average of 40 percent. The Vice President stressed the importance of passing the Build Back Better Agenda, which will extend the enhanced tax credits and allow millions of people to continue saving on their premiums. Additionally, the Build Back Better Agenda aims to expand health care accessibility and affordability by adding comprehensive dental, vision, and hearing services to Medicare, allowing Medicare to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs, and closing the Medicaid gap by providing federally-administered coverage for people in states that refuse to expand Medicaid. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to making high-quality health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.
