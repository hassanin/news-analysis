The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet announcing new actions to advance President Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI). The PMI aims to revolutionize healthcare by tailoring prevention strategies and treatment decisions to an individual's unique characteristics. The new actions include $55 million in awards from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to launch the PMI Cohort Program, which aims to recruit a million or more voluntary research participants. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to streamline its oversight of genomic tests, and tools and technology are being developed to make data accessible and usable for researchers and participants. The fact sheet also discusses steps to recruit research volunteers and support data and technology for the PMI Cohort, as well as efforts to modernize the regulatory approach to genomic tests.
