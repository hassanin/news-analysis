Seventy-six years ago, after World War II, countries came together to establish a rules-based international order through the United Nations (UN). The UN aims to promote human rights, peaceful dispute resolution, and adherence to international law. On United Nations Day, we celebrate the accomplishments of the UN and renew our commitment to peace, dignity, and security for all. However, the world faces challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, inequality, threats to democracy, and misuse of technology. The United States, as the largest financial contributor to the UN, is determined to lead alongside allies to address these pressing issues. The UN remains crucial for global cooperation, peace, human rights, health, and maintaining a rules-based order. The US has rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, campaigned for a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, and restored funding for the World Health Organization. The US is also providing financial and vaccine support for the global COVID-19 response. To strengthen the UN's role, the US budget proposal calls for full payment of the UN's regular and peacekeeping budgets. The choices we make in the coming years will shape our future, and the US stands firmly in support of the UN. We must work with allies to strengthen the UN and tackle borderless challenges. By upholding freedom, equality, opportunity, and human dignity, we can build a better world and ensure lasting US leadership on the global stage. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. proclaims October 24, 2021, as United Nations Day and urges observance of the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
