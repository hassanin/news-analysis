Vice President Kamala Harris addressed a group of education leaders in her Vice President's Ceremonial Office. She began by discussing the historic significance of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is set to be the largest investment ever made to address the climate crisis. The legislation includes provisions such as allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capping insulin costs for seniors. Harris also highlighted the administration's achievements in terms of reducing child poverty, supporting small businesses, and creating jobs. She mentioned the importance of NATO's strength and the bipartisan bill on gun safety. Harris acknowledged that there is still work to be done and expressed concern about the recent Supreme Court decision limiting reproductive rights. She emphasized the need to trust women to make their own decisions and discussed the specific challenges faced by women in college. The administration has taken steps to protect reproductive healthcare, including signing executive orders and challenging state laws. Harris praised colleges and universities for their efforts to protect students' access to care through flexible attendance policies, emergency funds, and privacy policies. The discussion with education leaders was moderated by Secretary of Education Cardona.
