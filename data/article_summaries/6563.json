Yesterday, the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse was launched by the Gender Policy Council and National Security Council. The Task Force was established through a Presidential Memorandum and aims to prevent and respond to online harassment and abuse. During the launch, survivors and experts shared personal stories and recommendations on the impact of online abuse, which includes psychological distress, negative health impacts, self-censorship, disruptions to education and economic loss, and experiences of physical and sexual violence. It was noted that online harassment and abuse disproportionately affects women, girls, and LGBTQI+ individuals, especially those of color. The Task Force will provide a blueprint for action within 180 days, focusing on expanding research, improving prevention efforts, supporting survivors, and holding offenders and technology platforms accountable. Roundtables will be held in the coming weeks and months to gather input from various stakeholders. The Task Force is co-chaired by the Gender Policy Council and National Security Council and includes Cabinet officials, senior White House leadership, and heads of relevant departments and agencies.
