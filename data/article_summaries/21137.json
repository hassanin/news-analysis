The G-20 Leaders have launched the Seoul Action Plan, which aims to achieve a strong and durable recovery without returning to past imbalances. The plan emphasizes the need for surplus countries to increase domestic demand, while deficit countries increase savings and repair their balance sheets. This will result in a more balanced global demand and a robust recovery in the United States. The plan builds on previous G-20 actions and highlights the importance of all nations, both emerging and advanced, surplus and deficit, working together for rapid and less risky economic growth. The plan includes measures such as deploying fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies to reduce external imbalances, assessing imbalances against guidelines, enhancing exchange rate flexibility, pursuing structural reforms, undertaking financial regulatory reforms, and resisting trade and financial protectionism. The United States is committed to reducing its fiscal deficit while shifting towards investment and exports. The plan aims to achieve a more balanced global demand and a stronger, job-rich recovery in the United States by promoting balanced demand growth, flexible exchange rates, financial and structural reforms, and sustainable public finances.
