The White House has released a report on the progress made in elementary and secondary education since President Obama took office, as well as the impact of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) on education. The report highlights achievements such as adopting higher academic standards, reaching the highest high school graduation rate on record, investing in early education, expanding access to high-speed internet, and training excellent STEM teachers. The ESSA, which replaces the No Child Left Behind Act, aims to ensure states set high standards, maintain accountability, empower state and local decision-makers, preserve annual assessments, provide access to high-quality preschool, and establish resources to test promising practices and replicate proven strategies. The report also outlines the Obama Administration's efforts to improve education, including investments in quality preschool, higher standards, fewer and better assessments, strong teachers, competitive programs, innovation, promise neighborhoods, and expanding access to technology.
