Secretaries of Transportation from three different administrations – Ray LaHood, Mary E. Peters, and James H. Burnley IV – have praised President Donald J. Trump's plan to shift air traffic control functions to a new, non-governmental entity. LaHood commended Trump for his leadership in creating a more efficient and effective Air Traffic Control system, while Peters stated that the move will modernize the ATC system, making air travel more efficient and providing a better passenger experience. Burnley emphasized the need to separate the ATC system from government constraints and praised Trump's proposal as the right solution for the 21st century.
