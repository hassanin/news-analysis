The Biden administration has launched the Small and Less Populous Island Economies (SALPIE) Initiative, aimed at strengthening economic cooperation with island countries and territories in the Caribbean, North Atlantic, and Pacific regions. The initiative focuses on countering the economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, promoting economic recovery, addressing the climate crisis, and advancing shared long-term interests. Island economies heavily dependent on imports and tourism have been particularly affected by the pandemic. These same communities are also vulnerable to climate change impacts such as severe storms, rising sea levels, and warming ocean temperatures. The SALPIE partners are geographically diverse island economies with populations under 1 million and high susceptibility to the effects of climate change. Many of them do not qualify for concessional foreign assistance due to their higher income levels per capita. The initiative aims to enhance economic cooperation through bilateral, regional, and multilateral collaboration. In addition to addressing immediate economic and humanitarian consequences, the United States seeks to strengthen economic ties, counter predatory investment practices, and enhance collaboration within international organizations. The initiative involves 29 US departments and agencies coordinating engagements in various areas.
