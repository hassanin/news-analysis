The article discusses the progress made on the economic plan, focusing on lower inflation, higher incomes, and solid growth. Inflation has slowed in the third quarter, mainly due to a decrease in energy prices. Gas prices have dropped by over $1.20 since the summer's peak. The plan aims to further reduce prescription drug prices and energy costs starting next year. In January, seniors will experience an increase in Social Security checks by an average of $140 per month, while their Medicare premiums decrease. This is the first time in a decade that this has occurred. Additionally, starting in January, billion-dollar companies will be required to pay taxes. In contrast, the article highlights the Congressional Republicans' agenda, which focuses on cutting taxes for the wealthy and large corporations. This could potentially drive up inflation, add to the deficit, and increase the cost of prescription drugs, healthcare, and energy for American families.
