The memorandum titled "Transparency and Open Government" was issued by President Barack Obama on January 21, 2009. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of openness, transparency, public participation, and collaboration in government. It states that the administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness and will work to establish a system that promotes accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. The memorandum calls for government information to be disclosed rapidly and made readily available to the public. It also encourages public engagement and participation in policymaking and decision-making processes. Collaboration between government agencies, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and individuals in the private sector is also encouraged. The memorandum directs the Chief Technology Officer, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Administrator of General Services, to develop recommendations for an Open Government Directive within 120 days. The directive would instruct executive departments and agencies to take specific actions to implement the principles outlined in the memorandum. The memorandum clarifies that it does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other entities.
