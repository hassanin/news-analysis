The COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force has been established to address the health inequities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent such inequities in the future. It will provide recommendations on various aspects of the pandemic response, including the equitable allocation of resources and relief funds, effective outreach to underserved populations, and improving cultural proficiency within the government. The Task Force is chaired by Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith and consists of twelve non-federal members with diverse backgrounds and expertise. They represent a range of racial and ethnic groups, as well as important populations such as children and youth, health care providers, immigrants, individuals with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and more. The Task Force will also include representatives from six federal agencies. Its work will conclude with a final report to the COVID-19 Response Coordinator, addressing the drivers of health inequities observed during the pandemic and proposing actions to prevent such inequities in future responses.
