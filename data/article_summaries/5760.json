The Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, spoke at the South Court Auditorium about the burden of medical debt on Americans. She emphasized the need for individuals to be able to focus on their recovery without the added stress of debt. Harris highlighted that one in three adults in the country struggles with unpaid medical bills, with a disproportionate number being Black or Latino. She discussed the importance of protecting consumer rights and launched a new public education campaign to help consumers understand and utilize their rights when dealing with medical debt. Harris also addressed the unethical and illegal practices of debt collection companies and expressed the administration's commitment to holding them accountable. The Vice President highlighted efforts to help Americans pay off their medical debt, including the Department of Veterans Affairs canceling or refunding $1 billion in medical co-payments for over one and a half million veterans. She urged veterans with medical debt to apply for debt relief through a streamlined online application process. Harris also discussed the negative impact of medical debt on credit scores and applauded the decision of credit reporting agencies to no longer include medical debt in credit scores under certain conditions. The administration is directing federal agencies to eliminate medical debt as a factor in accessing federal resources. Harris reiterated the administration's commitment to affordable healthcare and improving financial assistance under the Affordable Care Act, closing the Medicaid coverage gap, and empowering Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.
