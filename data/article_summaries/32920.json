President Donald Trump has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House, notifying him of the intent to suspend duty-free treatment for all African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)-eligible goods in the apparel sector for Rwanda. The suspension is a response to the barriers that the Rwandan government has imposed on US trade, specifically affecting certain US exports of apparel products. Despite engagement from US officials, the issues have not been resolved, leading to the determination that Rwanda is not making continual progress towards the elimination of barriers to US trade and investment, as required by AGOA. The suspension of duty-free treatment is seen as a more appropriate response than terminating Rwanda's designation as a beneficiary under AGOA, as it allows for continued efforts to resolve outstanding issues. The US will continue to assess Rwanda's progress and the effectiveness of the suspension in promoting compliance with AGOA requirements.
