The report demonstrates progress in reducing inflation and lowering costs for American families. Inflation has decreased to 3.1 percent, down by nearly two-thirds from its peak. Unemployment remains below 4 percent, resulting in higher wages and household wealth. Prices have also declined for various products, including cars, gas, TVs, toys, appliances, eggs, and milk. However, many Americans still find things unaffordable. Efforts are being made to lower costs for insulin, prescription drugs, health insurance premiums, and utility bills, as well as eliminate hidden fees. Large corporations are urged to pass on savings to consumers. In contrast, Republicans in Congress lack a plan to reduce costs for families and instead focus on benefiting the wealthy and corporations. They oppose efforts to lower insulin and prescription drug costs and aim to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Despite this, the focus remains on fighting for lower costs and a strong middle class to grow the economy.
