President Barack Obama has issued a notice stating that the national emergency declared in Proclamation 7463, regarding the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, will continue for an additional year. The President believes that the terrorist threat that led to the declaration of the national emergency in 2001 still persists and therefore it is necessary to extend the emergency beyond September 14, 2015.
