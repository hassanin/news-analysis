President Barack Obama has proclaimed December 2015 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of preventing drunk, drugged, and distracted driving, which puts drivers, passengers, and pedestrians at risk. The holiday season, with its increased travel and alcohol consumption, poses particular dangers. The proclamation urges Americans to remain vigilant and aware of impaired drivers and to take responsible actions, such as speaking out against impaired driving, taking away the keys of intoxicated individuals, and reminding drivers to stay focused on the road. The Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over campaign aims to raise awareness and prevent impaired driving during the holiday season. The federal government is also committed to reducing impaired driving by supporting law enforcement efforts and encouraging states to enact drugged driving laws. Americans are encouraged to plan ahead, designate a non-drinking driver, and arrange for alternative transportation to ensure the safety of all during the holiday season.
