President Obama has declared a state of emergency in Arizona due to a severe winter storm that began on January 20, 2010. This declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts in order to alleviate the suffering and hardship caused by the emergency. FEMA is authorized to provide assistance to save lives, protect property and public health and safety, and prevent a catastrophe in Apache, Coconino, and Navajo Counties, as well as the Hopi Tribe and Navajo Nation within these counties. The agency can identify, mobilize, and provide equipment and resources as needed. Emergency protective measures will be funded at 75 percent by the federal government. Mark A. Neveau has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-3272.
