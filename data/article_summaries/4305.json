During a press briefing, Dr. Walensky provided an update on the state of the pandemic. She stated that the Delta variant is spreading with high efficiency and now represents more than 83% of the virus circulating in the United States. The Delta variant is more aggressive and much more transmissible than previously circulating strains. Dr. Walensky urged those who are still on the fence about getting vaccinated to ask questions and get informed so they can make an informed decision. She also emphasized the importance of taking the Delta variant seriously and continuing to follow preventive measures until fully vaccinated. Dr. Fauci discussed breakthrough infections and explained that while breakthrough infections are expected, the vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. He emphasized that the vaccines are doing their job and that the majority of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are among the unvaccinated. Mr. Zients discussed the current situation and highlighted three reasons why it is different from earlier in the year: the vaccines work, a large number of Americans are fully vaccinated, and progress is being made in increasing vaccination rates. He also announced additional resources to get more shots in arms and combat surges, including funding for rural health clinics and investments in testing and mitigation measures in high-risk congregate settings. Surgeon General Murthy discussed the importance of trusted messengers in promoting vaccination and addressing health misinformation. He emphasized the need for continued conversations about vaccination and the importance of accurate information. Overall, the briefing emphasized the importance of vaccination, the effectiveness of the vaccines, and the need to continue following preventive measures.
