First Lady Jill Biden has set forth the priorities of Joining Forces, a White House initiative aimed at supporting military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. The initiative will focus on three main areas: Employment and Entrepreneurship, Military Child Education, and Health and Well-Being. Dr. Biden emphasized the importance of supporting military families for national security. The next phase of Joining Forces began before Inauguration Day with the appointment of Executive Director Rory Brosius. Military families face unique challenges, which have been exacerbated by the global pandemic. Joining Forces aims to provide comprehensive and long-term solutions to support military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. The initiative will collaborate with federal agencies, non-profit organizations, corporate stakeholders, and service providers to address gaps in support and improve access to resources. Joining Forces was originally launched in 2011 by Dr. Biden and former First Lady Michelle Obama to support service members, veterans, and their families.
