President Obama released a statement on the income, poverty, and health coverage data released by the Census Bureau. The data showed that in 2009, incomes did not rise for the typical household, the percentage of Americans without health insurance rose to 16.7 percent, and the percentage of Americans living in poverty increased to 14.3 percent. However, the statement also highlighted that the Recovery Act and other programs helped keep millions of Americans out of poverty. The expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) also protected children from economic distress. The Affordable Care Act was mentioned as a way to further expand health insurance coverage. The statement acknowledged that even before the recession, middle-class incomes were stagnant and the number of people in poverty was unacceptably high. The President emphasized the need to improve schools, invest in infrastructure, and build the skills of workers to address these challenges. Despite the difficulties, the President expressed confidence in America's workers and believed that the country would emerge from the recession with a stronger economy.
