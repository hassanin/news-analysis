President Donald J. Trump has signed the Never Again Education Act into law. This act directs the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to develop and disseminate resources to promote a better understanding of the Holocaust. It also authorizes Holocaust education programs to engage teachers and educational leaders. The act aims to ensure that future generations know and remember the tragic history of the Holocaust and reflect on how evil and intolerance briefly overcame humanity. The President emphasized the importance of condemning and confronting anti-Semitism, which continues to exist in the world. The United States will not tolerate mass persecution and mass murder like that perpetrated during the Holocaust, and the administration will always work to protect the right of all people to worship freely.
