The US Department of the Treasury and Department of State have announced sanctions on individuals and entities that support the Assad regime in Syria. The sanctions target regime-loyalists, Syrian financiers involved in corrupt reconstruction efforts, and individuals disrupting the ceasefire in northern Syria. The Assad regime has committed numerous atrocities since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, including arbitrary detention, torture, sexual violence, and murder. The sanctions are intended to hold the regime accountable and send a clear message that no one should do business with them. The US remains committed to a political solution to bring a peaceful end to the Syrian conflict.
