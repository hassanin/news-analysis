President Biden has declared a major disaster in Tennessee due to severe storm and flooding on August 21, 2021. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas, particularly Humphreys County. Assistance may include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover. Federal funding is also available for emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation statewide. Myra M. Shird has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Damage assessments are ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated later. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can start applying for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will be available from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
