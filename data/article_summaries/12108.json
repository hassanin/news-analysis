President Barack Obama has proclaimed July 21 through July 27, 2013, as Captive Nations Week. This week is an opportunity to reaffirm America's commitment to advancing human rights worldwide. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of universal rights and the need to support those who seek freedom, self-determination, dignity, and the rule of law. It acknowledges that while progress has been made, there are still many parts of the world where fundamental freedoms remain unrealized. The proclamation calls on the people of the United States to reaffirm their ties to governments and people committed to freedom, dignity, and opportunity for all.
