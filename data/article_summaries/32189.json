President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring October 2018 as National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. The proclamation acknowledges the increasing threat of cyber threats to the economy and public infrastructure and emphasizes the importance of taking steps to mitigate and prevent future attacks. The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the nation's cyber defenses and national security. Collaboration among all government departments and agencies has improved federal network cybersecurity, enhanced coordination with the private sector to protect critical infrastructure, and expanded efforts to build a strong cybersecurity workforce. The National Cyber Strategy, released on September 20, 2018, outlines the government's commitment to using all means available to protect the country from cyber threats. While the government is taking steps to protect American businesses and individuals, the proclamation emphasizes the importance of individual responsibility in adopting better cybersecurity practices. Citizens are encouraged to request more security from the products and services they use, use multi-factor authentication, leverage secure networks, limit personal information sharing, and take other actions to secure applications. The proclamation also calls on industry and government partners to work together to share information and enhance the resilience of the nation's cyber infrastructure. The cooperation between the public and private sectors, along with personal risk-management, will strengthen the nation's cyber infrastructure for future generations.
