The article discusses the agreements reached by President Obama with the G-20 countries and China to combat climate change by addressing the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The G-20 leaders expressed their support for using the expertise and institutions of the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and consumption of HFCs. President Obama and President Xi agreed to establish a contact group under the Montreal Protocol to consider issues related to HFCs, such as cost-effectiveness, financial and technology support, safety, environmental benefits, and an amendment to the Protocol. HFCs are potent greenhouse gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners, and industrial applications. If left unabated, HFC emissions could contribute to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. The Montreal Protocol, established in 1987 to protect the ozone layer, has successfully phased out several key classes of chemicals, but the transition away from ozone-depleting substances has led to the rapid growth of HFCs. The United States, Canada, and Mexico have proposed an amendment to the Protocol to phase down the production and consumption of HFCs. The reduction of HFCs is also an important component of President Obama's Climate Action Plan. The administration has already taken steps domestically to encourage the reduction of HFC leakage and transition to safer alternatives in vehicle air conditioning systems. The Environmental Protection Agency will also encourage private sector investment in low-emissions technology and the use of climate-friendly chemicals.
