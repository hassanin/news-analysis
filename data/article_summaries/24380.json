In this article, President Barack Obama announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations. The national emergency was initially declared on July 24, 2011, through Executive Order 13581, in order to address the threat posed by these criminal organizations to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The activities of these organizations have grown in scope and gravity, posing a risk to international political and economic systems. They have become more sophisticated and dangerous, with involvement in foreign governments and the international financial system, which undermines democratic institutions, the rule of law, and economic markets. These organizations also exacerbate violent conflicts and enable the activities of other dangerous individuals. Due to the ongoing threat, the national emergency is being extended for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
