On World Intellectual Property Day, President Joe Biden acknowledges the innovators and creators who contribute to society by developing products, services, companies, and industries. He emphasizes the importance of intellectual property protection in enabling small businesses to compete, thrive, and play a significant role in communities and economic progress. Small businesses are highlighted as critical to the success of the nation, comprising 90% of businesses, employing nearly half of the private sector workforce, and creating two-thirds of new jobs. Intellectual property, including trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets, is crucial in ensuring that small businesses are compensated for their creations and customer service. Without these protections, unscrupulous competitors could copy and profit from their ideas. Science and technology are also recognized for safeguarding intellectual property, and investment in digital infrastructure is promoted to support innovation and protect citizens' rights. The 75th anniversary of the Lanham Act, the nation's trademark law, is celebrated for enabling small businesses to establish brand awareness and loyalty while protecting consumers from counterfeits and deceitful practices. Copyright protection is acknowledged for rewarding creative individuals and allowing them to continue their work. President Biden expresses the administration's commitment to strengthening American industrial and innovative strength and creating an inclusive, resilient, and innovative economy. He proclaims April 26, 2021, as World Intellectual Property Day, encouraging Americans to support small businesses and celebrate their creativity, hard work, and passion.
