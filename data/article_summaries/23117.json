The United States is expressing deep disappointment over the conviction of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. The decision to prosecute Anwar and the conduct of his trial have raised concerns about the rule of law and the fairness of Malaysia's judicial system. The US is also concerned about the government's intention to expand its sedition law to prosecute government critics. The US urges the Malaysian government to apply the rule of law fairly and transparently in order to promote confidence in Malaysia's democracy, judiciary, and economy. Despite these concerns, the US remains committed to expanding cooperation with Malaysia on shared economic and security challenges in Asia and globally.
