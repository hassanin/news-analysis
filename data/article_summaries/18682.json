President Barack Obama has proclaimed October 23-29, 2016, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Week. HBCUs are seen as living monuments to the cause of equality, justice, and possibility. These institutions were built with the goal of providing higher education opportunities for all, rather than just a few. HBCUs have played a significant role in shaping America, producing graduates who have made important contributions in various fields. During his presidency, Obama has focused on expanding opportunities for higher education, including for HBCU students. His administration has increased Pell Grants, expanded student loan assistance, and created the College Scorecard to help prospective students in their decision-making. Obama has also worked to make community college free for hardworking students, which would benefit both community colleges and 4-year HBCUs. The proclamation calls on Americans to recognize and honor the contributions of HBCUs and their alumni to the country.
