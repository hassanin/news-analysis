The G-20 Toronto Summit Declaration outlines the steps that the G-20 countries will take to ensure a full return to growth with quality jobs, reform and strengthen financial systems, and create strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth. The declaration highlights the progress that has been made in addressing the global economic crisis, but also recognizes the challenges that still remain, such as uneven and fragile recovery, high unemployment, and the social impact of the crisis. The G-20 countries are committed to sustaining the recovery, creating jobs, and achieving stronger, more sustainable, and more balanced growth. They will follow through on fiscal stimulus and communicate growth-friendly fiscal consolidation plans, strengthen social safety nets, pursue structural reforms, and make progress on rebalancing global demand. The declaration also emphasizes the need to build a more resilient financial system, strengthen financial market infrastructure, and address the issue of systemic institutions. The G-20 countries are also committed to narrowing the development gap and reducing poverty, fighting protectionism, promoting trade and investment, combating corruption, and addressing climate change and food security. They will strengthen the legitimacy, credibility, and effectiveness of the International Financial Institutions (IFIs), including the World Bank and IMF, and support the needs of the most vulnerable countries. The G-20 countries will meet again in Seoul, Korea, in November 2010.
