The article discusses the ongoing national emergency declared by the President of the United States with respect to Sudan. The national emergency was initially declared in 1997 and has been expanded and modified multiple times through executive orders. The latest expansion was made in May 2023 due to the military's seizure of power and inter-service fighting in Sudan. The article states that the crisis in Sudan continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency declared in 1997 must continue beyond November 3, 2023. The notice of this decision will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress. The article is signed by Joseph R. Biden Jr., the President at the time.
