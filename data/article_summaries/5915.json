President Biden has announced new actions to address the shortage of infant formula in the United States. The largest infant formula manufacturer in the country, Abbott Nutrition, initiated a voluntary recall of several formula lines on February 17th due to concerns about bacterial contamination. Since then, the federal government has been working to address the production shortfall caused by the recall. The President spoke with retailers and manufacturers, including Walmart, Target, Mead Johnson, and Gerber, to discuss their efforts to increase production and ensure availability of infant formula. The President also announced several steps to get more infant formula on store shelves, including cutting red tape to increase flexibility in the WIC program, cracking down on price gouging and unfair market practices, and increasing imports of infant formula. The goal is to quickly increase the availability of infant formula without compromising safety. The administration is exploring all options, including the possibility of invoking the Defense Production Act. The exact timeline for when the supply will be felt on store shelves is not provided, but the government is working to mitigate the shortages and improve the shopping experience for families.
