Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas met with Colombian Foreign Minister Alvaro Leyva, Ambassador Luis Gilberto Murillo, and their delegation at the White House on June 10, 2023. The two sides discussed collaboration on migration and regional development and emphasized the importance of creating new legal pathways to reduce irregular migration. They agreed to implement Safe Mobility Offices (SMOs) starting on June 19, 2023, which will allow migrants to apply for registration and receive guidance on safe and legal migration options. The United States also reiterated its commitment to expanding legal pathways for Colombian nationals, including through labor and family reunification opportunities. These efforts align with the joint statement made on June 5, 2023, which highlighted the need for broader initiatives to provide social services, employment, and sustainable opportunities for communities along Colombia's borders.
