Deputy National Security Advisor Mike Pyle met with Bjoern Seibert, Head of Cabinet to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, to discuss various priority issues, including Ukraine reconstruction. They also launched the US-EU Task Force on the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to promote a better understanding of the law's progress in lowering costs for families, achieving shared climate goals, and addressing concerns for EU producers. The meeting emphasized the importance of coordination and support for sustainable and resilient supply chains, particularly in the clean energy sector. The first Task Force meeting will take place next week. The Task Force involves multiple US government agencies, including the White House, State Department, Treasury Department, Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, Senior Advisor for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation John Podesta, and Mr. Seibert will continue to engage in high-level discussions on these issues.
