The United States and the European Union (EU) recognize the importance of their economic relationship and aim to strengthen it. As part of this effort, they have established a High-Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth, led by U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht. The group is tasked with identifying policies and measures to increase trade and investment between the two entities, with the goal of creating jobs, promoting economic growth, and enhancing international competitiveness. The group will examine various areas, including trade barriers, regulations and standards, non-tariff barriers, and cooperation on global issues. The group will assess the impact, feasibility, and consistency of each option and recommend practical means of implementation. An interim update on their progress will be provided in June 2012, and a final report will be issued by the end of the year.
