The Administration is strongly supporting the Preventing Emerging Threats Act of 2018, which aims to provide the necessary legal authorities to detect, track, and mitigate threats from small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). The bill would allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to develop and deploy counter-UAS technology within the United States to mitigate the risks posed by drones. The goal is to integrate UAS into the national airspace safely while protecting privacy, civil liberties, and national security. The current federal laws restrict the government's ability to fully evaluate and use essential detection, tracking, and mitigation technologies to counter these threats. Enacting this legislation would help support the growth of the drone industry and ensure the safe integration of drones into the national airspace. The Administration is looking forward to collaborating with the relevant committees to ensure the legislation achieves its intended effect.
