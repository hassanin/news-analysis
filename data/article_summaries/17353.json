The White House strongly condemns the Syrian government's use of violence and mass arrests in response to ongoing demonstrations. They salute the courage of Syrian protestors and regret the loss of life on all sides. The Syrian government's security crackdown and false reform announcements have failed to restore stability and satisfy the demand for change in Syria. The Syrian government's actions are likened to those of its Iranian ally, resorting to brute force and violating human rights. The United States and the international community will adjust their relations with Syria based on the concrete actions taken by the Syrian government. Sanctions have already been imposed on senior Syrian officials and other entities responsible for human rights abuses. The United States believes that a strong international response is warranted due to Syria's actions towards its people. Additional steps will be taken if there is no significant change in the government's approach. The European Union has also imposed sanctions on Syrian regime officials responsible for human rights abuses.
