President Barack Obama is requesting Congress to consider amendments to Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 proposals in his FY 2011 Budget. The proposed amendments include an increase of $1.5 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, Disaster Relief, to support response and recovery efforts for previous large events like Hurricane Katrina and the Midwest Floods. There are also amendments to general provisions that would provide authorization and funding for FY 2010 to implement the settlement of a case related to Indian trust accounts and to settle claims of prior discrimination brought by black farmers against the Department of Agriculture. The details of these requests can be found in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
