President Obama met with Governor Jan Brewer of Arizona at the White House to discuss various issues, including border security. The President mentioned his plan to secure the Southwest border and the additional resources his administration has allocated for that purpose. He also discussed his decision to deploy more National Guard troops to the border and his request for additional funds for border protection and law enforcement. The President acknowledged Governor Brewer's concerns and highlighted the administration's efforts to combat illegal trafficking and reduce crime rates along the border. Both the President and Governor agreed that the broken immigration system needs comprehensive reform, including securing the borders, holding employers accountable, and providing a pathway for undocumented immigrants to become legal. The President urged Governor Brewer to work with him in a bipartisan manner to achieve these goals. The President also expressed his concern with Arizona law SB1070, stating that it interferes with the federal government's responsibility to set and enforce immigration policy.
