President Biden addressed the nation to outline his plan for June to continue the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He highlighted the progress made in vaccinations, with nearly 170 million Americans having received the shot. The President emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated, as it not only protects individuals but also helps to reduce the spread of the virus. He urged young people to get vaccinated, as even mild cases can have long-term health implications. President Biden announced a month-long effort to reach the goal of having 70 percent of adult Americans vaccinated by July 4th. The plan includes making vaccinations more accessible, launching a national vaccination tour, partnering with barbershops and beauty shops for outreach, and working with employers to provide incentives and on-the-job vaccination clinics. The President encouraged everyone to get involved and help spread the word about the importance of vaccination.
