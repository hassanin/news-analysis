The Fourth Annual North American Drug Dialogue (NADD) took place on December 5-6, 2019, with officials from Canada, Mexico, and the United States gathering in Washington, D.C. The NADD serves as a platform for cooperation on drug issues and aims to address the transnational opioid crisis, illicit psychostimulants, and the broader drug crisis in North America. The NADD was established in 2016 following a commitment made by the three countries' heads of government during the North American Leaders Summit. The annual meetings are held at the Assistant Secretary level, and there are also trilateral trainings, study tours, and information exchanges throughout the year. The Fourth Annual NADD included expert panels on emerging drug trafficking trends, the public health challenges of psychostimulant use disorders, and best practices to combat illicit finance. During the high-level principals meeting, the delegates emphasized the need to intensify efforts against synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, methamphetamine, and other synthetic substances, and set the agenda for the next phase of the NADD.
