Vice President Biden led the U.S. delegation for the third meeting of the U.S.-Mexico High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) in Mexico City. The HLED has been a forum for the United States and Mexico to advance economic priorities, foster entrepreneurship, create jobs, strengthen competitiveness, and drive growth and innovation. The meeting focused on six priority areas: modern borders, energy, workforce development, regulatory cooperation, regional and global leadership, and stakeholder engagement. Both sides recognized the need to build on the previous year's achievements and agreed to integrate activities on sustainability and telecommunications into the HLED discussions, as well as develop a mechanism for binational border infrastructure prioritization. The Vice President met with representatives from the U.S. and Mexican private sector, think tanks, and civil society organizations before the meeting to hear their views and recommendations for the HLED.
