This article discusses President Obama's plan to improve teacher preparation programs in order to provide all children in America with a world-class education. The article highlights the importance of having great teachers in every classroom and the need to ensure that teachers are prepared and supported in their careers. Currently, many teachers report feeling unprepared when they enter the classroom after completing their teacher preparation program. The Obama Administration aims to strengthen teacher preparation programs by encouraging states to develop their own systems to identify high- and low-performing programs and to provide more meaningful information on teacher preparation. The Administration also plans to use state-developed program ratings to determine eligibility for TEACH grants. The article mentions various examples of innovative efforts to improve teacher preparation, such as the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation, states reporting information about teacher preparation programs, and universities implementing hands-on experiences for teacher candidates. Overall, the goal of these initiatives is to increase recognition for high-performing teacher preparation programs, provide information to prospective teachers and the public, and drive improvement across programs.
