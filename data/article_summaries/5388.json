President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed April 2023 as the Month of the Military Child. This is a time to honor the over 2 million children of service members and veterans who support and sacrifice to keep the military strong and the nation secure. These children understand what it means to serve and often face unique demands of military life with courage. They frequently uproot their lives, change schools, make new friends, and experience different cultures. They often celebrate birthdays and holidays without their loved ones present and sometimes become caregivers for wounded or ill family members. The administration is taking steps to support military-connected children, such as expanding the Military Parental Leave Program and providing access to affordable child care. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to honor military children with appropriate ceremonies and activities and encourages wearing purple in April to show support for their service.
