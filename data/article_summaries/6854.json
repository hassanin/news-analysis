The European Commission has made an adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, allowing the safe and secure transfer of personal data from Europe to U.S. companies. This decision is the result of years of cooperation between the United States and the European Union, and it demonstrates the strong transatlantic relationship based on shared democratic values and vision. The decision highlights the commitment to data privacy protection and will open up economic opportunities for both countries and companies on both sides of the Atlantic.
