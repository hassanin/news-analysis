The President of the United States is deeply saddened and outraged by the brutal murders of three people associated with the United States Consulate General in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. The victims include a U.S. citizen employee, her U.S. citizen husband, and the husband of a Mexican citizen employee. The President extends his condolences to the families and condemns these attacks on consular and diplomatic personnel. The U.S. government, in collaboration with Mexican authorities, will work tirelessly to bring the killers to justice. The President also shares the outrage of the Mexican people regarding the thousands of murders in Ciudad Juárez and other parts of Mexico. The U.S. will continue to work with Mexican President Felipe Calderón and his government to combat the power of drug trafficking organizations and protect innocent lives. This responsibility is particularly important in border communities where the Mexican and American people are closely connected through history, culture, and common interests.
