The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) held its third ministerial meeting to discuss transatlantic cooperation on trade, technology, and innovation. The meeting was co-chaired by top officials from both sides, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis. The United States and the European Union are working together on projects that align with shared values and promote a rules-based economic system. The meeting also included discussions on labor rights, digital connectivity, resilient supply chains, and digital policy and technology standards. The importance of democratic values, human rights, and upholding an international rules-based order was emphasized in light of geostrategic challenges such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. and the EU launched new initiatives to deepen cooperation bilaterally and with third countries, focusing on areas such as digital connectivity, emerging technologies, semiconductor supply chains, promoting values online, and supporting trade-related environment, labor, and health initiatives.
