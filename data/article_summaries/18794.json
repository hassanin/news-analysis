On November 23, 2011, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 398, suspends the required periods of time for filing a petition and appearing for an interview with the Department of Homeland Security to remove the conditional basis for permanent resident status of alien spouses of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, when either spouse is on active duty abroad in the U.S. Armed Forces. The second bill, H.R. 2447, awards a congressional gold medal to the Montford Point Marines in recognition of their personal sacrifice and service to their country. Lastly, S. 1412 designates a facility of the United States Postal Service located in Woburn, Massachusetts, as the Officer John Maguire Post Office.
