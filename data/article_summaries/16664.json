The White House has announced the launch of a new $100 million competition to expand tuition-free community college programs that connect Americans to in-demand jobs. This initiative is part of the Obama Administration's efforts to make education more accessible and affordable for all Americans. The competition will provide grants to create and expand innovative regional and sector partnerships between community colleges, training providers, employers, and the public workforce system. The goal is to develop more dynamic, tuition-free education and training programs for middle and high-skilled jobs. In addition, the announcement celebrates the 27 new free community college programs that have launched since the President's America's College Promise plan was introduced. These programs have added over $70 million in new public and private investments to serve nearly 40,000 students at community colleges. The investments are aimed at strengthening education and job-driven training programs to meet the demands of a competitive global economy.
