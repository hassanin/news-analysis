On August 17, 2001, President Joe Biden issued Executive Order 13222, declaring a national emergency related to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979. This national emergency was declared due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The President has now announced that this national emergency will continue beyond August 17, 2021, for another year. This decision is based on the need to implement certain sanctions authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The notice of this continuation will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
