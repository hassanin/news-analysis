The White House has issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. The memorandum emphasizes the opportunity for the United States to lead in the development of clean cars and trucks, which will create jobs, enhance energy security, and improve the environment. The memorandum requests additional coordinated steps to be taken to produce a new generation of clean vehicles.

The memorandum specifically addresses medium- and heavy-duty trucks, which continue to be a major source of fuel consumption and greenhouse gas pollution. It requests the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to begin work on a joint rulemaking to establish fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards for these vehicles by 2014.

In addition, the memorandum calls for the development of a coordinated national program to improve fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions for passenger cars and light-duty trucks from 2017 to 2025. The program aims to harmonize federal and state standards and promote the domestic production and use of advanced technologies.

The memorandum also highlights the importance of developing infrastructure and promoting cleaner fuels, including biofuels, to enable the deployment of advanced technologies. It requests the EPA to review nongreenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and fuels, while the Department of Energy is asked to provide technical assistance for cities preparing for the deployment of electric vehicles.

Overall, the memorandum seeks to enhance energy security, promote job creation, and protect the environment through the transformation of the nation's vehicle fleet.
