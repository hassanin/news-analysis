President Joe Biden is using his authority to commute the sentences of 11 individuals who are serving long prison terms for non-violent drug offenses. The individuals include Felipe Arriaga, Earlie Deacon Barber, James Michael Barber, Anthony Ewing, Quittman Andre Goodley, Deondre Cordell Higgins, Leroy Lymons, Angel Rosario, Esaias J. Tucker, Darryl Allen Winkfield, and Kenneth Winkler. The commutations will either expire on April 20, 2024, or February 20, 2024, depending on the individual, and will leave intact the supervised release terms and other components of their sentences.
