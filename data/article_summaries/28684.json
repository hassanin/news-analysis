According to an article in the Washington Examiner, the Census Bureau has reported that typical family incomes in the US rose to new record highs in 2017, while poverty levels fell to pre-recession lows. Median household income increased to $61,400, a 1.8 percent improvement from the previous year. This marks the first time in two decades that incomes have surpassed the all-time high set in 1999, when adjusted for inflation. The article suggests that these gains can be attributed to the ongoing economic recovery and increased employment, with more people working full time rather than part time.
