On International Women's Day, President Biden signed two executive orders. The first establishes the White House Gender Policy Council to advance gender equity and equal rights for women and girls. The second directs the Department of Education to review its existing regulations, orders, guidance, and policies to ensure consistency with the administration's policy to guarantee education free from sexual violence.

The newly named co-chairs of the Gender Policy Council are Julissa Reynoso, Chief of Staff to the First Lady, and Jennifer Klein, Executive Director of the Gender Policy Council. The council will focus on combating systemic bias and discrimination, increasing economic security and opportunity for women, ensuring access to comprehensive healthcare, strengthening efforts to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, promoting equity and opportunity in education and leadership, and advancing gender equality globally.

The President also signed an executive order directing the Department of Education to review its regulations on sexual misconduct on campus to ensure consistency with the administration's policy.

The President's focus remains on passing the American Rescue Plan, but he is also committed to advancing gender equity and equal rights for women and girls. The administration will work with Democrats and Republicans to address these issues.
