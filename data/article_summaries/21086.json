The White House Press Secretary released a statement expressing support for the Senate's bipartisan vote on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) of 2013. The President has long supported an inclusive ENDA, which aims to establish federal protections against employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The President thanks lawmakers from both parties for standing up for fairness and equality and looks forward to the Senate's further consideration of ENDA. The statement also encourages lawmakers to ensure that the legislation remains true to its intended goals.
