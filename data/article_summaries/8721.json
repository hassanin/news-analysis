The Respect for Marriage Act has been passed by the House of Representatives in a bipartisan manner, ensuring the rights of LGBTQI+ and interracial couples to marry. This brings peace of mind and security to millions of families and guarantees the rights and protections they deserve. The passage of this legislation also provides hope and dignity to young people, as their government recognizes and respects the families they create. The champions of this bill in Congress are acknowledged and thanked for their unwavering support. This bipartisan effort demonstrates that Democrats and Republicans can come together to protect fundamental rights. While progress has been made, there is still a need to continue fighting for full equality for LGBTQI+ Americans and all Americans.
