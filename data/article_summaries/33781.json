During meetings in Beijing, the Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, Jim Carroll, secured commitments from China to take further steps and law enforcement action to crack down on illicit fentanyl production and trafficking. These actions include establishing recurring law enforcement cooperation meetings, expanding detection and narcotics laboratory capabilities, improving tracking of postal shipments, and launching joint investigations. Chinese officials agreed to increase cooperation with the United States on this issue. The delegation also met with Chinese officials from the National Narcotics Control Commission and the Ministry of Public Security, as well as shipping industry leaders and toured Chinese mail inspection and customs facilities and a national narcotics laboratory.
