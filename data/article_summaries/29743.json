The article discusses the continuation of the national emergency declared by President Donald Trump with respect to North Korea. The national emergency was initially declared in 2008 due to the threat of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. Since then, it has been expanded multiple times to address the actions and policies of the North Korean government, including its nuclear and missile programs, human rights abuses, and illicit activities. The national emergency is extended for another year, as the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of North Korea continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
