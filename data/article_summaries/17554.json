President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Oklahoma, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, and straight-line winds that occurred from May 10-13, 2010. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in seven counties. This assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid individuals and business owners in recovering from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Damage surveys are ongoing in other areas, and additional forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by phone.
