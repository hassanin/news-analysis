On March 30, 2022, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536, which was issued on April 12, 2010, will continue for another year. The national emergency was declared due to the deteriorating security situation and persistent violence in Somalia, acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and violations of the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council. In 2012, Executive Order 13620 was issued to address additional concerns, such as exports of charcoal from Somalia that generate revenue for al-Shabaab, the misappropriation of Somali public assets, and acts of violence against civilians in Somalia. The President believes that the situation in Somalia still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This announcement complies with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
