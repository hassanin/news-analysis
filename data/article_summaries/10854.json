The TechHire initiative, launched by President Obama in 2015, aims to build a pipeline of tech talent to bring new jobs to local economies and provide opportunities for residents to enter the middle class. TechHire addresses the need for technology talent by offering fast-track training programs that can quickly prepare people with limited technology skills for job opportunities. Currently, there are nearly 600,000 open IT jobs across all sectors, and these jobs pay well above the average private-sector job. Since its launch, TechHire has trained over 4,000 people and connected them to work opportunities with local employers. Today, the initiative is expanding to over 70 cities, states, and rural areas, with 20 new communities joining. The TechHire Action Network, led by Opportunity@Work and the U.S. Department of Education, will support and grow the initiative. Additionally, TechUP | WeTechUP.com is launching the Include.io 2017 Roadshow to ignite diverse and non-traditional tech talent and help companies build their teams. The U.S. is currently underinvesting in training for jobs in technology and other in-demand fields, and there is a need for a significant increase in investment to fill existing jobs and create new ones.
