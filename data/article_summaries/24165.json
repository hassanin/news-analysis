President Obama visited the Johnson Controls Inc. advanced battery facility in Holland, Michigan to highlight the role of innovative technologies in achieving fuel economy standards and creating jobs in the advanced vehicle manufacturing industry. The trip builds on the President's recent announcement of fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, which will save American families $1.7 trillion at the pump and reduce oil consumption by 12 billion barrels by 2025. The President also announced fuel-efficiency standards for work trucks, buses, and heavy-duty vehicles, which will save American businesses approximately $50 billion in fuel costs. The proposed standards provide certainty to investors in advanced vehicle technologies and will stimulate the creation of high-quality domestic jobs. The auto industry is the largest manufacturing industry in the US, employing 700,000 people. Achieving the fuel economy goals will encourage automakers to use advanced technologies, and the EPA and DOT are considering incentive programs for early adoption of these technologies. The incentives include incentives for electric drive vehicles, advanced technology packages for large pickups, and off-cycle innovative technology credits. Johnson Controls Inc. received a $300 million grant to build domestic manufacturing capacity for advanced batteries, creating or saving 150 jobs. The company has opened its first domestic lithium-ion plant and is retrofitting another plant to focus on manufacturing batteries for Start-Stop technology. The US will be able to produce enough batteries and components to support 1 million plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles. The Department of Energy also announced support for 40 projects totaling over $175 million to accelerate the development and deployment of advanced vehicle technologies. The projects focus on improving advanced vehicle efficiency through various approaches.
