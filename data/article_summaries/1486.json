During a press briefing, Deputy National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi discussed the Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan. The plan aims to address the issue of lead exposure in water and paint, which poses a significant health risk, particularly for children. Zaidi highlighted the scale of the problem, with up to 10 million households and 400,000 schools and childcare centers impacted by lead exposure. He emphasized the need for urgent action to replace lead pipes and strengthen regulations to ensure safe drinking water. The plan includes allocating $3 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to replace pipes, writing new regulations to enhance testing requirements, and mobilizing resources from various federal agencies to address the crisis. Zaidi also discussed the broader climate agenda, including the Build Back Better plan, and emphasized the administration's commitment to tackling the climate crisis and creating jobs in the clean energy sector.
