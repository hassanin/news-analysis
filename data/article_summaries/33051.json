President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring September 8 to September 14, 2019, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Week. The proclamation recognizes the significant contributions that HBCUs have made to the education and prosperity of African Americans and the nation as a whole. HBCUs enroll nearly 10 percent of all African American college students and account for a significant portion of bachelor's and STEM degrees earned by African Americans. The Trump administration has prioritized HBCU success, providing over $404 million in funding for HBCU Higher Education Act programs and assisting financially struggling schools. The proclamation also highlights efforts to strengthen HBCUs by encouraging partnerships with local economic development goals. The proclamation coincides with the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first Africans in the American colonies and acknowledges the resilience of African Americans in the face of slavery, discrimination, and injustice. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe the week with appropriate programs and activities and to proudly display institutional colors on September 9, designated as National HBCU Colors Day.
