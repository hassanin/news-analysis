On America Recycles Day, President Biden recognizes the importance of recycling in protecting the environment and combating climate change. He honors those who work to recycle and responsibly manage natural resources and calls for collective action to create a greener and more sustainable future. The production and processing of everyday materials contribute to a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions and harmful pollutants. Recycling helps reduce waste, conserve energy, and preserve valuable resources. However, the United States still faces barriers to recycling, including confusion about recyclable materials and difficulties in finding markets for recycled products. Communities, particularly marginalized groups, have disproportionately suffered from pollution caused by landfills, dumping, and incineration. To improve recycling, the Biden Administration has invested significantly in recycling initiatives through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and released a National Recycling Strategy. The aim is to improve waste management, address environmental injustices, and promote public awareness and education about recycling. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act has been signed to support climate action and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. President Biden calls on manufacturers and businesses to offer sustainable products, adopt effective recycling practices, and design projects that are fully recyclable. He also urges individuals to learn about recycling in their communities, sort waste properly, use reusable containers, compost food, and reduce the use of non-recyclable materials. President Biden proclaims November 15, 2023, as America Recycles Day and encourages Americans to continue their environmental efforts throughout the year.
