The article discusses the U.S. financial reform bill that was reported out of conference committee by the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The bill aims to put the U.S. at the forefront of global financial reform and strengthen the international financial system. It includes measures to reduce moral hazard, limit systemic risk, increase transparency in the derivative market, and create a more resilient financial system. The U.S. is working with the European Union and others to implement the G-20's agenda for regulatory reform. The reforms aim to prevent "too big to fail" scenarios, bring transparency to hedge funds, close loopholes in the regulation of major financial firms, constrain the size and risks of the largest firms, reform pay practices at financial firms, separate banking and speculative trading, strengthen consumer protection, crack down on abuses in mortgage markets, and support long-term job growth by preventing future crises. The article emphasizes that the reforms will result in a stronger financial system that supports economic growth and prevents the disruption of financial institution failures.
