The article discusses a presidential memorandum issued on August 25, 2017, regarding military service by transgender individuals. The memorandum states that until June 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) generally prohibited openly transgender individuals from serving in the military. However, the Obama Administration allowed transgender individuals to serve openly, authorized funding for sex-reassignment surgeries, and permitted their accession into the military. The current administration has extended the deadline to alter the accession policy to January 1, 2018, as further study is needed to assess the impact of the policy change. The memorandum directs the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to return to the previous policy until there is sufficient basis to conclude that terminating it would not have negative effects on military effectiveness, unit cohesion, and resource allocation. The memorandum also directs the halt of funding for sex reassignment surgeries, except for those already in progress. The effective dates for the memorandum are January 1, 2018, and March 23, 2018. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is required to submit a plan by February 21, 2018, for implementing the policy changes. The memorandum clarifies that it does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
