President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster for the Seminole Tribe of Florida in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement the tribe's efforts in combating the virus. Federal funding is now available for emergency protective measures and direct federal assistance for the tribe and its associated lands affected by COVID-19. Gracia B. Szczech has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the tribe and deemed necessary based on further assessments.
