The White House has submitted an updated request for $65.8 billion in fiscal year 2015 overseas contingency operations (OCO) funding to Congress. This includes $58.6 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) and $7.3 billion for the Department of State and Other International Programs (State/OIP). The request primarily funds temporary and extraordinary expenses associated with military operations in Afghanistan, as well as counterterrorism efforts in the region. The request also seeks support for the new $5 billion Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF) and $1 billion for the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI). The CTPF aims to respond to emerging needs as terrorist threats evolve, while the ERI provides temporary support to strengthen NATO allies and partner states in Europe. The request also includes additional funding for peacekeeping missions in the Central African Republic.
