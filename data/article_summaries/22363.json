President Obama has announced that two transportation projects in California will be expedited as part of his We Can't Wait initiative. These projects aim to improve local and regional connectivity, as well as provide more transportation choices for the state. The projects are the California High-Speed Rail - Central Valley Construction and the San Francisco Downtown Ferry Terminal expansion. The high-speed rail project will extend approximately 114 miles in California's Central Valley, with planned stations in Fresno, Bakersfield, and a potential station near Hanford. It is expected to create jobs and help stimulate the region's economy. The ferry terminal expansion project in downtown San Francisco will improve facilities and boarding for over 10,000 daily passengers, as well as enhance connections to pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities. These projects will undergo early and intensive coordination to save up to 6 months on project schedules. The Office of Management and Budget is overseeing efforts to make the permitting and review process for infrastructure projects more efficient and effective. The administration aims to add transparency, accountability, and certainty to the process to facilitate the modernization of the nation's infrastructure.
