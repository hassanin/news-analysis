President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States a national emergency. This declaration grants the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) the authority to temporarily waive or modify certain requirements of Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance programs, as well as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule. The proclamation also emphasizes the need for hospitals and medical facilities to assess their preparedness and be ready to handle the surge in cases. The declaration is in response to the global spread of the novel coronavirus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since become a pandemic. The goal of this proclamation is to contain and combat the virus within the United States.
