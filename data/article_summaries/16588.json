President Barack Obama has announced his intent to appoint ten individuals to the Presidential Commission on Election Administration. The commission was created to find non-partisan ways to shorten lines at polling places, improve the efficiency of elections, and increase access to voting for all citizens. The appointees include Robert F. Bauer and Benjamin L. Ginsberg as co-chairs, and Brian Britton, Joe Echevarria, Trey Grayson, Larry Lomax, Michele Coleman Mayes, Ann McGeehan, Tammy Patrick, and Christopher Thomas as members. The President emphasized the importance of the right to vote and the need to ensure that all eligible voters have the opportunity to cast their ballots without obstacles or unnecessary delays.
