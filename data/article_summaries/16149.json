This executive order, signed by President Barack Obama in 2014, aims to promote economy and efficiency in federal government procurement. The order enforces civil rights laws that prohibit discriminatory practices with respect to compensation. It states that federal contractors employing such practices are subject to enforcement action, which can disrupt and delay federal contracting processes. The order emphasizes that compensation discrimination can lead to labor disputes and restricts the information available to participants in the federal contracting labor pool, diminishing market efficiency. To address this, the order prohibits federal contractors from discharging or discriminating against employees or applicants who inquire about, discuss, or disclose compensation information. The Secretary of Labor is required to propose regulations to implement these requirements within 160 days of the order's date. The order also clarifies that it does not limit the rights of employees or applicants under any provision of law and allows federal contractors to pursue defenses as long as they do not prohibit employees or applicants from discussing or disclosing compensation. The order becomes effective immediately and applies to contracts entered into on or after the effective date of rules promulgated by the Department of Labor.
