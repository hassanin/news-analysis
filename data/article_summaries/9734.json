President Obama issued a presidential memorandum directing federal agencies engaged abroad to promote and protect the human rights of LGBT persons. The memorandum applies to various government departments and agencies and directs them to combat the criminalization of LGBT status or conduct abroad, protect vulnerable LGBT refugees and asylum seekers, leverage foreign assistance to protect human rights and advance nondiscrimination, ensure swift and meaningful responses to human rights abuses of LGBT persons abroad, engage international organizations in the fight against LGBT discrimination, and report on progress. The State Department has been working to protect and promote the rights of LGBT persons worldwide, engaging bilaterally and regionally to encourage countries to repeal or reform laws criminalizing LGBT conduct or status, reinforcing the human rights of LGBT people in multilateral fora, supporting human rights defenders and civil society groups, and reporting on the conditions of human rights of LGBT people in its annual reports. The Department has also strengthened its personnel and consular policies to include same-sex domestic partners and gender identity. Additionally, the protection of LGBT refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants is prioritized through a strategy developed with other government agencies, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and NGOs.
