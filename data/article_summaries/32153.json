Karen Pence, the Second Lady of the United States, recently visited Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital and participated in an art therapy session with a young boy named D.J. D.J., who suffers from Cystic Fibrosis, finds working with the art therapist, Maria Fazzini, to be relaxing. The hospital also has a music therapist on staff, and D.J. has had the opportunity to work with her as well. Karen Pence was impressed by the hospital's understanding of the importance of these types of therapies in helping children cope with the stresses of being hospitalized. She also shared information about her own initiative, Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART.
