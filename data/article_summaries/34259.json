The recently introduced tax-reform bills in the House of Representatives and Senate are focusing on small-business tax cuts. This relief is seen as long overdue and would address the overtaxation that many small business owners say is their biggest hurdle. Small businesses have not fully recovered from the Great Recession, and new business formation remains low. The proposed tax cuts would allow small businesses to keep more of their earnings, helping them to survive and thrive in today's competitive business environment. Both bills call for doubling the income threshold under which businesses and families pay zero tax to $24,000, expanding the child tax credit, and eliminating certain tax brackets. Small-business owners would use their tax savings to create new jobs, increase wages, and expand their businesses. Overall, these tax cuts are seen as beneficial for small-business owners and all Americans.
