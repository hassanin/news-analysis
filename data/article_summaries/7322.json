First Lady Jill Biden has created the theme "Hallo-READ!" for this year's Halloween event at the White House. The event will welcome local public school students and military-connected children for trick-or-treating. The theme emphasizes famous literary characters, ghost stories, and the enjoyment of reading. Children will receive candy and books from the President and First Lady, as well as other representatives from various government departments and organizations. The event will also feature spooky story time with special guests. Approximately 8,000 guests will participate, with each family receiving chocolate and candy treats, as well as donated books from Scholastic. Instacart is providing support for the event and will distribute Halloween tote bags, treats, and recipe cards for making Halloween-themed treats. Costumed characters like Clifford the Big Red Dog and Disney friends will be present. The White House will be decorated with autumnal foliage, stacks of books, and displays of ghoulish literary characters. Spooky story time will be held, featuring various authors, the Librarian of Congress, the Secretary of Education, and other special guests.
