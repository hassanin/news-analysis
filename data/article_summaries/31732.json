The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), along with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), has announced the winners of the Opioid Detection Challenge. The grand prize of $500,000 goes to IDSS for its detection solution, which combines a 3D X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner with automated detection algorithms. The runner-up, One Resonance, will receive $250,000 for its QROD system, which uses quadrupole resonance technology to search for specific materials. The goal of the challenge is to find nonintrusive detection tools that can help find illicit opioids in international mail. The government plans to work with the winners to further develop and deploy these tools in facilities across the country.
