Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum to put an end to the practice of "catch and release," where immigrants who have violated US immigration laws are released into the country shortly after being apprehended. The President emphasizes the importance of the safety and security of the American people and promises to protect the country and uphold its laws. Additionally, he urges congressional Democrats to stop opposing border security measures that are crucial for the safety and security of the United States.
