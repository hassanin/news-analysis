The White House Press Secretary issued a statement on the reauthorization of the Collection of Bulk Telephony Metadata under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. In 2014, President Obama directed an end to the program and proposed that the data should remain with the telephone companies instead of the government. The proposal would require new legislation to allow the government to obtain data from these companies through individual court orders. However, Congress has failed to pass legislation to implement these reforms. The USA FREEDOM Act, which was supported by the Administration, was introduced but did not advance in the Senate. The Administration has worked with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to implement reforms to the program, including limitations on when the metadata can be queried. Section 215 and other important authorities will expire on June 1, 2015. The FISC has approved an extension of the modified telephony metadata program, but Congress has a limited window to enact legislation that would implement the President's proposed path forward. The Administration is ready to work with Congress on this legislation.
