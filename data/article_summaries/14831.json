The White House has announced new regulatory changes for Cuba sanctions, following President Obama's decision to re-establish diplomatic relations and normalize relations with Cuba in 2014. The changes aim to promote engagement between the US and Cuban citizens by facilitating travel, commerce, and access to information. The Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, in coordination with the Department of State, have previously issued amended regulations to support the President's policy. The new changes will remove financing restrictions for most authorized exports, increase support for the Cuban people, facilitate authorized exports, and further facilitate authorized travel. The US government encourages the Cuban government to make it easier for its citizens to start businesses, engage in trade, and access information online. These regulatory changes aim to empower the Cuban people, promote human rights, improve lives, and strengthen ties between the two countries.
