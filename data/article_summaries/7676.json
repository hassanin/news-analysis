Minnesota has become the twelfth state to pass paid family and medical leave legislation, with President Biden commending Governor Tim Walz and other state leaders for their efforts. This legislation will allow Minnesotans to take time off work without losing their pay to recover from illness, care for sick family members, or welcome a new child. The program is expected to boost the state's economy and support families' economic security. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to advocate for national paid leave and applauds Minnesota's progress.
