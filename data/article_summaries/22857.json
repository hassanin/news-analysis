President Barack Obama has issued a memorandum authorizing the Secretary of State to provide assistance under the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962. The memorandum states that it is in the national interest to provide up to $10 million from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to address urgent refugee and migration needs resulting from the conflict in Northern Mali. The funds may be used for contributions to international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, as well as for administrative expenses of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration of the Department of State. The memorandum also directs the publication of this decision in the Federal Register.
