The President and First Lady have announced plans for two springtime events: Spring Garden Tours and the White House Easter Egg Roll. The Spring Garden Tours will take place on April 9 and 10, from 10:00 AM to 4:30 PM. Tickets will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis at the Ellipse Visitors Pavilion starting at 8:30 AM. The White House Easter Egg Roll will happen on April 18, and tickets can be requested through an online lottery from March 25 to March 31. Volunteers interested in supporting the event can apply online by March 31. The White House will closely monitor the COVID-19 situation and may adjust the availability of the tours accordingly. Face masks will be available for those who choose to wear them.
