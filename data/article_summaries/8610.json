The United States has praised the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Coalition forces for successfully regaining control of the Hasakah prison in Syria. The SDF's bravery and determination prevented ISIS from conducting a large-scale prison break to rebuild its forces. This incident highlights the need to prevent ISIS from regenerating and to address the inadequate detention facilities holding thousands of ISIS detainees. The United States is dedicated to working with partners in Iraq and northeast Syria, as well as the Defeat-ISIS Coalition, to counter the global threat posed by ISIS.
