The United States economy grew at a strong rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest economic expansion in nearly four years. This growth is accompanied by new jobs, near-record low unemployment, and soaring business confidence. Americans' confidence in the economy is rising, thanks to tax cuts and a strong labor market. The U.S. added 213,000 jobs in June, with employment increasing in industries such as health care, manufacturing, and construction. Wage growth also accelerated in June to 2.7 percent annually. Economists expect the unemployment rate to continue to decrease, potentially reaching levels not seen in half a century. Retail sales have been increasing for five consecutive months, supported by a tight labor market and lower taxes. American factories are also experiencing unexpected growth, with the manufacturing index reaching its highest level since February. Small business optimism remains high, with the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index falling slightly but still maintaining one of the highest readings in its history. Manufacturing confidence is at a record high, with 95.1 percent of manufacturers surveyed having a positive outlook for their companies. Employment growth, capital spending, and wage growth are all projected to increase. Overall, the U.S. economy is showing strong signs of growth and positive momentum.
