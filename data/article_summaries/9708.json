In this presidential memorandum, Barack Obama designates the Secretary of the Interior as an authorized representative of the Federal Government under Section 7302 of the National Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. This designation applies specifically to lands administered by the Department of the Interior in the National Capital Region. The memorandum states that if a public event is designated as a National Special Security Event (NSSE), the Secretary of the Interior should coordinate with the United States Secret Service regarding the intent to enter into a National Capital Region mutual aid agreement, if this agreement would impact the security plan for the designated NSSE.
