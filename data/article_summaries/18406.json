This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama regarding the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), as well as trade agreements with Israel and tariff modifications for pharmaceutical products. 

In the proclamation, Obama terminates the designation of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country under the AGOA. He also modifies the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) to reflect changes in duty-free access for agricultural products from Israel. Additionally, the HTS is modified to implement a multilateral agreement to eliminate tariffs on certain pharmaceutical products and chemical intermediates. 

The proclamation states the effective dates for these changes and supersedes any previous proclamations or executive orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken.
