The Cancer Moonshot Summit, hosted by Vice President Joe Biden, brought together researchers, oncologists, data and technology experts, patients, families, and patient advocates to discuss how to accelerate progress in cancer research and treatment. As part of the summit, a number of new public and private sector actions were announced. These include partnerships between the National Cancer Institute and pharmaceutical companies to expedite researchers' access to investigational cancer drugs, a collaboration between the National Cancer Institute and the White House Presidential Innovation Fellows to improve access to information about cancer clinical trials, and a strategic computing partnership between the Department of Energy and the National Cancer Institute to analyze cancer data using supercomputers. Other actions announced include the creation of an open access resource for sharing cancer data, a collaboration between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Energy to apply computational assets to cancer research, the establishment of an Oncology Center of Excellence at the Food and Drug Administration, and the creation of a fast-track review for cancer treatment-related patents. Additionally, several private sector organizations have made commitments to support the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, including the American Cancer Society, the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and the National Brain Tumor Society.
