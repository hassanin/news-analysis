One year ago, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which aimed to invest in the nation's infrastructure and increase competitiveness. The administration has made significant progress in implementing the law, announcing over $185 billion in funding and more than 6,900 specific projects across all 50 states, D.C., and the territories. These projects include rebuilding roads, bridges, ports, and airports, upgrading public transit and rail systems, replacing lead pipes for clean water, cleaning up pollution, providing affordable high-speed internet to every family, delivering cheaper and cleaner energy, and creating good-paying jobs. The administration has also taken more than 200 trips to discuss these projects with community members. Key highlights of the law include upgrading transportation and supply chains, improving water conservation and resilience, cleaning up legacy pollution, modernizing the grid and deploying clean energy, and expanding high-speed internet. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to delivering on the promise of this legislation and building a better America.
