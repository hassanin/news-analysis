On Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day, President Joe Biden reaffirms his commitment to justice and healing for Indigenous communities. The Federal Government has a responsibility to take swift and effective action in cases of missing or murdered individuals. The administration is dedicated to investigating and resolving these cases, as well as addressing the underlying causes of violence through research and collaboration with Native communities. Public safety and the well-being of Native Americans are top priorities, and efforts have been made to improve law enforcement, prevention, intervention, and survivor services. The Department of Justice is working closely with Tribal Nations to develop guidelines for these cases, and a steering committee has been created to oversee and coordinate this work. The Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022 was signed into law, expanding special criminal jurisdiction of Tribal courts and supporting safety initiatives for survivors in Alaska Native villages. The administration recognizes the importance of working with Tribal partners to create victim-centered, trauma-informed, and culturally appropriate solutions. The failure to address this ongoing tragedy undermines the humanity of us all, and it is crucial to stand up for Indigenous people and address the thousands of unsolved cases that demand justice and healing. President Biden proclaims May 5, 2022, as Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day and calls on all Americans and levels of government to support Tribal communities' efforts through appropriate programs and activities.
