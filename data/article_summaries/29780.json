The United States has witnessed recent life-threatening attacks in Iraq, specifically on the United States consulate in Basra and the American embassy compound in Baghdad. Iran, which has provided support to these attacks through funding, training, and weapons, did not take action to prevent them. The US government will hold Tehran responsible for any attack that causes harm to American personnel or damage to US facilities. The US will respond promptly and firmly to protect American lives.
