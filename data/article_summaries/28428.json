Astronomers have for the first time measured both gravitational waves and light from the collision of two neutron stars, a discovery that could help validate Einstein's theory of relativity and provide insight into the physics of the universe. The National Science Foundation (NSF) announced the groundbreaking discovery, stating that it is an example of the revolutionary potential of basic scientific research that the Trump Administration prioritizes. The discovery was made using the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors, which detected the gravitational signal from the neutron stars colliding. A third detector called Virgo helped scientists pinpoint the source of the signal, allowing telescopes around the world to observe other forms of light emitted from the collision. The observations showed that heavy elements such as gold and platinum were created by the merger of the neutron stars, answering a long-standing question about the existence of heavier elements in the universe. This discovery marks the first time astronomers have been able to observe both gravitational waves and light from a cosmic collision.
