Congress has passed the first overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years, called the Tax Cuts Act. This legislation is seen as a symbol of what Republicans can accomplish when they unite behind a positive governing agenda. It is not about Republicans vs. Democrats, but rather about returning money from Washington to the people. The new law makes three important changes to the tax system, and the proof of its effectiveness will come when Americans start seeing more money in their paychecks as early as February. The bill is also aimed at restoring America's economic dominance by flattening the tax rate for all American companies, allowing them to invest more in the country's future. President Trump believes that this will lead to companies coming back to the U.S., and with the stock market breaking record highs in 2017, the project of American renewal seems to be off to a good start.
