The U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced sanctions against 18 senior Syrian regime officials in response to the confirmed use of chlorine as a chemical weapon by the regime in 2014 and 2015. This is the first time the United States has sanctioned specific Syrian officials for violating the Chemical Weapons Convention and UN Security Council Resolution 2118. The U.S. strongly condemns the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons and its disregard for human decency, international obligations, and global norms. The United States will continue to work with international partners to hold the Syrian regime accountable for its use of chemical weapons and urges all UN member states and parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention, including Russia, to support efforts to enforce accountability through the UN Security Council and domestic law. The international community must send a clear message that chemical weapons use is unacceptable and will have serious consequences.
