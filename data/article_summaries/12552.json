President Obama has announced the National Disaster Resilience Competition, which will provide nearly $1 billion in funds to communities that have experienced natural disasters. The competition aims to help these communities rebuild and increase their resilience to future disasters. It will support innovative resilience projects at the local level and encourage communities to adopt policy changes and activities that plan for the impacts of extreme weather and climate change. The need for urgent action is emphasized by the increasing temperatures, more frequent and intense heat waves, hurricanes, and severe storms, as well as rising sea levels. The competition will enable communities to engage local stakeholders, NGOs, and the philanthropic sector to enhance resilient infrastructure and make investments that protect their communities from the impacts of climate change. Approximately $820 million will be available to all states and local governments that experienced a major disaster between 2011 and 2013, while the Hurricane Sandy-affected region will be eligible for approximately $180 million. HUD will ensure geographic diversity in the selection of participating communities.
