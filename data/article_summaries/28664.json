President Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Oregon due to wildfires and straight-line winds. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. Affected individuals in certain counties can receive assistance such as grants for housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation statewide. Dolph A. Diemont has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Damage assessments are still ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated later. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The FEMA News Desk can be contacted for further information.
