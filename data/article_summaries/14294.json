The White House is expressing frustration with the Republican party for delaying the passage of an unemployment insurance extension. The statement highlights that Republican obstruction has already caused 2.5 million Americans to lose essential aid, and by the end of the week, an additional 350,000 Americans could be affected. The White House emphasizes that the livelihoods of nearly 3 million Americans should not be impacted by partisan politics. The delay gives the Republican minority thirty more hours to stall in the Senate, but this means thirty more hours of suffering for families in need.
