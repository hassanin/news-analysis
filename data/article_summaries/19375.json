On June 3, 2009, Vice President Biden and Transportation Secretary LaHood held a roundtable discussion with Governors and state transportation officials on the High-Speed Rail Grant Program in the Recovery Act. The purpose of the discussion was for state leaders to share their ideas about high-speed rail with the Obama Administration before the application process in the summer. Governors from Wisconsin, Michigan, Virginia, Missouri, Massachusetts, Georgia, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, as well as state transportation officials from New Hampshire, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Iowa, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Ohio, Maryland, Michigan, Tennessee, and California, attended the roundtable. A pool spray was held at the start of the roundtable.
