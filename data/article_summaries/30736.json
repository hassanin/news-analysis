The U.S. labor market is currently the strongest it has been in the last 50 years, thanks to President Trump's pro-growth economic policies. The economy has added 7 million jobs since the 2016 election, surpassing the predictions of the Congressional Budget Office. The unemployment rate has reached a record low of 3.5%, benefiting various demographic groups, including African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, veterans, and people with disabilities. Notably, more job openings are available than there are unemployed people. The strong labor market has also led to higher wages, with historically-disadvantaged groups experiencing higher wage growth compared to more advantaged groups. Additionally, the bottom 50% of households have seen a 47% increase in net worth under the Trump administration. Major deregulatory actions have also contributed to increased household incomes and reduced inequality. By promoting economic freedom and private-sector innovation, the administration has led to lower prices for natural gas, gasoline, electricity, and oil, resulting in savings for American families. The booming job market and higher incomes have helped reduce poverty rates and the number of people relying on means-tested welfare programs. However, there are still barriers that prevent lower-income workers from fully benefiting from the strong labor market, and the administration is working to address these through initiatives such as Opportunity Zones and combatting the opioid crisis. The evidence shows that President Trump's policies have allowed historically-disadvantaged Americans to improve their economic situations, proving that pro-growth policies are effective in delivering inclusive growth to people of all backgrounds.
