President Trump delivered a significant speech in Warsaw, Poland, three years ago, emphasizing the defense of Western civilization against its enemies. He paid tribute to the heroes of the Warsaw Uprising who fought against the Nazis in 1944. The President also acknowledged Pope John Paul II's role in bringing down Communism in Europe. Inspired by the Pope's message, the Polish people united in their determination, chanting "We want God." Recently, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited the John Paul II Shrine in Washington, D.C., to honor his contributions to ending oppression. The President continues to advocate for religious liberty and signed an executive order to promote it worldwide. He believes that religious liberties are a fundamental right bestowed by God and essential for society's flourishing.
