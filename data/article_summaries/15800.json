President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama expressed their sadness over the passing of gospel singer Albertina Walker. They described her as a Grammy Award-winning artist and the "Queen of Gospel." Walker began singing in her church youth choir at the age of four and used her voice to spread the "Good News" through song. She performed before President Bill Clinton and was honored by President George W. Bush at the White House for her contributions to Gospel music. Walker also gave back to her community through charitable endeavors, including the establishment of the Albertina Walker Scholarship Fund. The Obamas acknowledged that while America has lost an icon, Walker's influence on gospel music will continue for generations. They extended their thoughts and prayers to her family and the countless lives she touched.
