Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at the Treasury Department, discussing the importance of addressing disparities in access to capital and financial services in the United States. She highlighted the historical context of Freedman's Bank, which was established in 1865 to help newly freed Black Americans build wealth and secure a better future. However, the bank was forced to close just nine years later, resulting in the loss of savings for over 60,000 people. Harris emphasized that the vision of an inclusive economy, where all Americans have access to financial resources, remains unrealized.

Harris shared examples of the impact that community lenders have made through the investment of $8 billion distributed to 162 community lenders across the country. These lenders have provided loans to support various initiatives, such as funding an opioid addiction treatment facility on Tribal lands, helping Black-owned companies build affordable housing, and supporting Black-owned and women-owned businesses.

The Vice President acknowledged that there is still much work to be done to address the lack of capital and support for entrepreneurs, homeowners, and students in underserved communities. She emphasized the need for public-private partnerships to combine the expertise and experience of the private sector with the reach and scale of the government. Harris also highlighted the Economic Opportunity Coalition, which consists of over 20 private-sector organizations that have committed billions of dollars to promote capital access for minority-owned businesses, expand financial services, and create affordable housing.

Harris concluded by stating that America is a nation driven by the ambition and aspiration of its people, and it is crucial to continue fighting for equal opportunities to realize dreams and determine one's future. She expressed gratitude for the vision, commitment, and work of all those involved in addressing these disparities.
