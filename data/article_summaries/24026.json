President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Iowa and has ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The declaration is in response to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from May 19 to June 14, 2013. Federal funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The funding will be provided on a cost-sharing basis. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding. Joe M. Girot has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Further damage assessments may result in additional designations.
