The article is a joint statement from the governments of multiple countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, among others. The purpose of the statement is to emphasize the importance of civil society in addressing common challenges and to coordinate efforts to promote and protect civil society in the face of ongoing restrictions. The governments express concern about the increasing restrictions on civil society and commit to working together to combat this trend. They will support existing mechanisms, such as the U.N. system, the Community of Democracies, and the Open Government Partnership, and enhance their support for the work of the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. The governments also pledge to promote laws, policies, and practices that foster a positive space for civil society and oppose measures that impede its efforts. They will take joint diplomatic action to support civil society in countries where it is under threat and work on providing technical, financial, and logistical support. The governments will continue to engage with representatives of civil society and gather again to review progress. They call on other governments, civil society, philanthropic community, and the private sector to partner with them in supporting and defending civil society.
