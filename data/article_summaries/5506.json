The National Climate Task Force, chaired by National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, held its eleventh meeting to kick off Earth Week. The Task Force discussed the recently-published IPCC Report on Climate Mitigation and agreed that urgent climate action is necessary across all sectors of the economy. The Administration's efforts align with the IPCC's findings and focus on deploying clean energy, electrifying transportation, decarbonizing industries, and reducing super-polluting HFCs. Since Earth Day 2021, the Biden Administration has made significant progress in offshore wind, electric transportation, home weatherization, and environmental justice. The Task Force emphasized the importance of reaching all communities and ensuring the benefits of clean energy are accessible to everyone. Energy Secretary Granholm emphasized minimizing the impact of rising gas prices caused by international conflicts, while Infrastructure Coordinator Landrieu highlighted the benefits of infrastructure investments for rural and disadvantaged communities. The Task Force is comprised of Cabinet-level leaders from over 25 federal agencies, working to implement President Biden's whole-of-government approach to tackling the climate crisis.
