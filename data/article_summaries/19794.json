The deployed personnel, approximately 47 individuals, are equipped for combat but their main objective is to protect US citizens and property. They will remain in South Sudan until the security situation improves. Additional US Armed Forces, around 130 military personnel currently in Djibouti, are prepared to provide support if necessary. President Obama has taken this action to fulfill his responsibility to protect US citizens and in line with US national security and foreign policy interests.
