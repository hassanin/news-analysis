The alliance between Japan and the United States is crucial for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and globally. Space cooperation is an essential part of this alliance. During a meeting between Prime Minister Kishida and the US, both countries expressed their interest in enhancing collaboration in outer space, including commercial, civil, and security sectors. As a result of these discussions, Japan has announced its intention to extend its support of International Space Station (ISS) operations until 2030, following the US's announcement of its ISS extension a year ago. Furthermore, both countries have agreed to collaborate on the Lunar Gateway orbiting platform, which will facilitate humanity's return to the Moon. Japan's contributions to these endeavors will advance scientific knowledge and ensure the safety of astronauts exploring outer space. This progress brings Japan one step closer to having a Japanese astronaut walk on the Moon. Overall, the cooperation between the US and Japan in space is stronger than ever.
