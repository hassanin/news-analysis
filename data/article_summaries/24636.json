The White House has released a report called "Teacher Jobs at Risk" which outlines the challenges faced by the education system and the impact of the American Jobs Act. The report states that the American Jobs Act will support nearly 400,000 education jobs, preventing layoffs and allowing for the hiring or rehiring of teachers. The plan also aims to modernize 35,000 public school buildings and community college campuses, creating job opportunities for construction workers. The severe recession has caused budget problems for state and local governments, leading to layoffs of teachers and education personnel. Without additional support, as many as 280,000 teacher jobs could be at risk in the coming year. President Obama believes that investing in education is crucial for the future of the country and has urged Congress to pass the American Jobs Act. The President and Vice President have both visited educational institutions to highlight the importance of the act.
