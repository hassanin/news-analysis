The White House announced that President Obama's planned trips to Indonesia and Australia will be postponed due to the delayed final vote on the health care legislation. The President called the leaders of both countries to inform them of the change and expressed his regret for the delay. While the President recognizes the importance of international alliances, he is determined to prioritize the passage of health insurance reform. The visit to Indonesia is now expected to take place in June.
