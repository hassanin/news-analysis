On January 23, 1995, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat posed by foreign terrorists disrupting the Middle East peace process. This emergency was modified on August 20, 1998, to include four additional individuals who posed a threat to the peace process. On February 16, 2005, the President clarified the steps taken in the previous executive orders. The terrorist activities in the Middle East continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, President Trump has decided to extend the national emergency for one year, starting from January 23, 2018. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
