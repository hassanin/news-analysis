The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017, has enacted several tax cuts and reforms. Wage growth has been stagnant for the past two decades, and between 2007 and 2016, it was negative. This departure from historical wage growth may be attributed to trends in capital deepening, which measures capital per worker. Capital per worker influences productivity and therefore wage growth. In 2014, capital deepening turned negative for the first time since WWII. It is possible that policies discouraging capital investment in the US, such as the high corporate tax rate, played a role in this. However, with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the corporate tax position is now expected to encourage investment and wage growth in America. The Act is also expected to reduce the trade deficit and increase the corporate income tax base. Evidence suggests that a corporate tax rate cut does not lead to an increase in government debt or interest rates. As a result, GDP growth forecasts have increased, with Wall Street's largest banks now predicting an average growth of 2.5% compared to 1.9% in October 2016. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is expected to contribute to GDP growth by 0.3 to 0.5 percent this year, and other economists estimate that the individual side of the reform will add an additional 0.8 percent growth through 2019.
