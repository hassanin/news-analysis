President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in Oklahoma due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from April 28 to May 2, 2017. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Charles Maskell has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made later if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
