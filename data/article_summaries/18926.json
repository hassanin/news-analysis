The White House has announced its intention to rescind Cuba's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. Cuba was designated as such in 1982 due to its support for armed revolution and terrorism. The President is required to submit a report to Congress justifying the rescission and certifying that Cuba has not supported terrorism in the past six months and will not support it in the future. After a review of Cuba's record and assurances from the Cuban government, the Secretary of State recommended the rescission. The decision is based on the statutory standard and facts, and although the US still has concerns about Cuba's policies, they are not relevant to the terrorism designation. The US will continue engaging with the Cuban government and people to support its interests and values.
