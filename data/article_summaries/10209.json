National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan to discuss the U.S.-Afghanistan Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA). Rice conveyed that the U.S. is prepared to sign the agreement, which was overwhelmingly endorsed by the Loya Jirga. However, Karzai outlined new conditions and indicated he is not prepared to sign the BSA promptly. Rice stressed that delaying the signature would jeopardize the planning for a potential post-2014 military presence and the assistance pledges made by NATO and other nations. Without a prompt signature, the U.S. would begin planning for a future without U.S. or NATO troops in Afghanistan. Rice also highlighted the support she found among the Afghan people for an enduring partnership with the U.S. and the prompt signing of the BSA.
