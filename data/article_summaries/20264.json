In this op-ed, First Lady Michelle Obama discusses the business case for healthier food options. She highlights how businesses across the country are achieving success by creating and selling healthy products. For example, Wal-Mart has reduced the costs of fruits and vegetables for consumers by $2.3 billion and reduced the sugar in its products by 10%. Other companies like Disney, Walgreens, and various restaurants are also making efforts to offer healthier options. These companies are responding to consumer demand, with 82% of consumers believing it's important for companies to offer healthy products that fit family budgets. The First Lady also emphasizes the economic impact of obesity-related health conditions, which cost businesses $190 billion a year. She calls for more businesses to invest in a healthier future for children and states that progress is being made, but there is still work to be done. The First Lady expresses optimism and confidence that with leadership from the business community, the childhood obesity problem can be solved.
