In this article, President Barack Obama discusses the progress being made in the US economy. He highlights that the GDP increased for the first time in over a year and at a faster rate than in the previous two years. He acknowledges that there is still a long way to go and that there will be ups and downs, but these positive indicators show that the country is moving in the right direction. Obama credits his government's actions, such as providing credit to families and businesses, reducing foreclosures, and implementing the Recovery Act, for mitigating the worst of the recession and preserving and generating over a million jobs. He also emphasizes the importance of investing in infrastructure, education, medical research, and clean energy to create long-term prosperity. However, he acknowledges that there is still work to be done and that positive economic news may not be felt by everyone, especially those who have lost their jobs or are struggling with healthcare costs or mortgages. Despite the challenges, Obama remains committed to building an economy where everyone has access to jobs and opportunities for success.
