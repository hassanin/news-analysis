The United States is doubling down on mobilizing financial solutions in the Americas, including launching a new investment platform to build sustainable infrastructure and strengthening critical supply chains. They are also establishing a Fund for Nature to support nature-based climate solutions. The second focus is investing in people by launching the Americas Partnership Accelerator, a program to help entrepreneurs develop and fund their ideas. Additionally, they are establishing a regional Center of Excellence in Costa Rica to provide education and training in the digital economy. Lastly, they are affirming a region-wide approach to managing migration flows by stabilizing migrant populations, expanding legal pathways, and enforcing immigration laws in a humane and effective way. The President urges the United States Congress to provide supplemental funds for this strategy.
