Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the President and White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, Stefanie Feldman, Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and Rosie Hidalgo, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor on Gender-Based Violence, held a meeting with state legislative leaders from Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas to discuss Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) laws. ERPOs, also known as "red flag" laws, allow individuals to petition for a court order that temporarily prevents people in crisis from accessing firearms if they pose a danger to themselves or others. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, signed into law by President Biden, includes $750 million for states to implement crisis interventions like ERPOs. Currently, 19 states have ERPO laws, and with federal funding available, the meeting aimed to encourage more states to pass ERPO legislation and educate the public and law enforcement on how to seek an ERPO. During the meeting, legislative leaders from Florida and Maryland shared their successful experiences in passing ERPO laws, while leaders from other states discussed their plans for advancing ERPO legislation. The participants also discussed best practices for ERPO education and outreach campaigns.
