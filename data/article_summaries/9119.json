President Biden held a Cabinet meeting in the East Room to discuss the progress made on his executive order to promote competition in the economy. He highlighted the need to address the concentration of power in industries such as big tech, big pharma, and big agriculture, which has resulted in higher prices and lower wages for Americans. The President mentioned three specific areas where progress has been made: the right to repair, making hearing aids more accessible and affordable, and scrutinizing mergers to protect consumers and small businesses. He emphasized the importance of capitalism with competition and outlined upcoming priorities, including addressing non-compete clauses and protecting farmers and ranchers. The President then handed over the floor to Brian Deese to start the meeting. During a brief interaction with the press, President Biden mentioned a call with European leaders regarding Ukraine but did not provide details. He also responded to questions about sending troops to Ukraine and inflation.
