The United States' electric grid is in desperate need of upgrades due to its age and vulnerability to natural disasters. Power outages cost American businesses $150 billion annually, and increased transmission is necessary to support clean energy and reduce emissions. To address these issues, President Biden's Investing in America agenda is delivering the largest electric grid infrastructure investment in history, with over $30 billion allocated. The Department of Energy has announced a $1.3 billion commitment to develop transmission lines across six states, creating thousands of jobs. A National Transmission Needs Study has also been released to identify areas that would benefit from increased transmission. In addition, the Department of Energy has invested nearly $3.5 billion to strengthen grid reliability and resilience across 44 states, bringing more renewable energy online and creating job opportunities. The administration aims to expand capacity for renewable energy, reduce power outages, and mitigate the risk of wildfires. They are also working on streamlining permitting processes and advancing planning for transmission projects.
