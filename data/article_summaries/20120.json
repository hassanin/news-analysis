The completion of the destruction of Syria's declared chemical weapons stockpile is an important achievement in the effort to counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The most lethal declared chemical weapons possessed by the Syrian regime were destroyed ahead of schedule by dedicated U.S. civilian and military professionals aboard the M/V Cape Ray. This milestone is a result of the international community's efforts, led by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), to rid the Syrian regime of its chemical weapons. It sends a clear message that the use of these weapons will not be tolerated. The United Nations-OPCW Joint Mission and the entire international coalition, including close allies and partners, played a crucial role in this achievement. However, there are concerns about Syria's declaration to the OPCW and allegations of continued use of chemical weapons. These concerns must be addressed, and the international community will work closely with the OPCW to seek resolution while urging the Asad regime to end its atrocities against the Syrian people.
