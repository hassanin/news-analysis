President Trump is meeting with workers and businesses in West Virginia who are benefiting from tax reform, including receiving bonuses and experiencing new investment and hiring. Several companies, such as Citizens Bank of West Virginia, Worldwide Equipment, McCormick & Co., and Southwire, have given bonuses to their employees due to the savings from the federal tax reform. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is expected to save state employees in West Virginia $50 million per year, and the new tax law will directly cut taxes for nearly two-thirds of households in 2018. The lower corporate tax rate is projected to save Wisconsin utility customers over $275 million, and companies like Dixon Valve and Coupling Co., Wichita Railway Services, and Sun Solar are also reinvesting in their employees due to the tax cuts.
