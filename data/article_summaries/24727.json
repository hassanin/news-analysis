President Obama has signed a major disaster declaration for the state of Minnesota, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that began on March 16, 2009. The declaration enables federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The affected counties include Clay, Kittson, Marshall, Norman, Polk, Traverse, and Wilkin, with the possibility of additional assistance being designated after further assessments are completed. Michael H. Smith has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the area. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-4600.
