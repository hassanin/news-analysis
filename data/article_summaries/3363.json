President Joseph R. Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Michigan and authorized federal assistance for the areas affected by severe storms, flooding, and tornadoes in late June 2021. The declaration makes federal funding available to individuals in Washtenaw and Wayne counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Scott A. Burgess has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are complete. Affected residents and business owners can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. seven days a week.
