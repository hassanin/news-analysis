President Barack Obama has proclaimed November 13 through November 19, 2016, as National Apprenticeship Week. In his proclamation, he highlights the importance of apprenticeship programs in helping people succeed in the workforce. Apprenticeships provide job-seekers with hands-on experiences and allow them to earn while they learn, ultimately preparing them for meaningful employment. These programs also benefit employers by increasing productivity and innovation. Various industries, such as healthcare, construction, information technology, and advanced manufacturing, are utilizing apprenticeship programs to meet their workforce needs. President Obama applauds the efforts of state and local leaders in expanding apprenticeships and emphasizes his administration's commitment to supporting these programs. Over the past few years, the number of registered apprenticeships has doubled, and federal funding has been invested to further enhance these initiatives. The president also encourages more employers to offer apprenticeships and urges workers to take advantage of these valuable learning and training opportunities. The proclamation concludes by calling on Congress, state and local governments, educational institutions, industry, labor leaders, and all Americans to support and raise awareness of apprenticeship programs in the United States.
