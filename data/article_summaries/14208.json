President Barack Obama has proclaimed April 2016 as National Donate Life Month in the United States. The proclamation highlights the importance of organ donation and the impact it can have on the lives of those in need. It emphasizes the urgent need for more organ donors and calls for support and innovation to reduce the number of people awaiting vital organ transplants. The proclamation also recognizes the efforts made by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to increase the availability of organs for transplant, such as the nationwide kidney exchange program and financial support for low-income living donors. The Affordable Care Act is mentioned for providing greater security to living donors by prohibiting insurers from denying health coverage to someone with a preexisting condition. The bipartisan HOPE Act is also mentioned, which paved the way for the first HIV-positive organ transplants in the United States. The proclamation encourages all Americans to indicate their desire to be a donor and provides information on how to register at OrganDonor.gov. It highlights the financial burden of caring for patients with end-stage kidney failure and the potential cost savings that can be achieved by increasing accessibility to organs. The proclamation acknowledges the progress made in organ transplants but emphasizes the need for more work to help the over 120,000 Americans on the organ waiting list. It calls on various sectors, including government, industry, academia, and philanthropic communities, to join forces in supporting efforts to boost the number of organ, eye, and tissue donors throughout the nation.
