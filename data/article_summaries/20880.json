The White House held a press call to provide an update on the campaign to counter ISIL. The call included three senior administration officials: Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications; Christine Wormuth, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; and Brett McGurk, Deputy Presidential Special Envoy for the Coalition to Counter ISIL. The officials discussed the progress made in degrading ISIL in Iraq and Syria and the challenges associated with the training-and-equip program. They announced a pause in the program and a shift in strategy to focus on equipping groups already fighting ISIL on the ground. The officials also addressed concerns about the Russian air campaign and the role of Turkey in the coalition. They emphasized the need for a political resolution in Syria and the ongoing efforts to support opposition groups. The officials stated that a no-fly zone is not currently under consideration.
