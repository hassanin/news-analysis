President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Rhode Island, ordering federal aid to supplement recovery efforts from a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred from January 26-28, 2015. The declaration allows federal funding for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, snow assistance, and hazard mitigation measures. Albert L. Lewis has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made later based on further damage assessments.
