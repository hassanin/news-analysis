In a speech delivered at a private residence in New York, President Joe Biden discussed his decision to run for office again and outlined the reasons for his candidacy. He highlighted the progress made during his administration, such as job creation, tackling climate change, and rallying the world against Russian aggression. However, he emphasized that the country is still at risk, with attacks on democracy, gun violence in schools, book banning, and racial and religious discrimination persisting. He criticized former President Donald Trump and his supporters for their divisive rhetoric and expressed his commitment to defending democracy and uniting the country.

He ended his speech on an optimistic note, believing that the United States has the potential to lead the world in addressing global challenges and creating a better future.
