On June 10, 2014, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 1726, awards a single congressional gold medal to the 65th Infantry Regiment, known as the Borinqueneers, in recognition of their military service, dedication, and acts of valor. The second bill, H.R. 3080, is called the "Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014." This bill authorizes the construction of 34 Army Corps of Engineers water resources projects, which aim to manage flood risks, improve navigation, reduce hurricane and storm damage risks, and restore the environment. The bill also modifies previously authorized projects and includes several other provisions related to water resources projects.
