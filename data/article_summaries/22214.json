The White House has announced its intention to withdraw Russia's designation as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. This decision is based on the fact that Russia is deemed to be sufficiently advanced in economic development and trade competitiveness, and therefore no longer requires preferential treatment under the GSP. President Barack Obama plans to issue a proclamation to officially withdraw Russia's designation.
