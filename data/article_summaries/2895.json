President Joe Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance in Hawaii due to wildfires that started on August 8, 2023. The increase in funding means that federal funds for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance, will cover 100 percent of the total eligible costs for a continuous 30-day period. The State of Hawaii can choose this 30-day period within the first 120 days from the start of the incident.
