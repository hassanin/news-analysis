The executive order issued on March 28, 2017, by President Donald Trump focuses on promoting clean and safe development of energy resources in the United States. The order aims to avoid unnecessary regulatory burdens on energy production, support job creation, and ensure the nation's geopolitical security. It emphasizes the need for affordable, reliable, safe, secure, and clean electricity, which can be produced from various domestic sources including coal, natural gas, nuclear material, and renewable sources. The order directs all agencies to review existing regulations that potentially hinder domestic energy development and suspend, revise, or rescind those that unduly burden such development. It also calls for actions to promote clean air and water while respecting the roles of Congress and the States in environmental matters. The order further revokes certain energy and climate-related Presidential actions, withdraws documents related to social cost estimates of greenhouse gases, and reviews regulations concerning the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan and oil and gas development. The order also lifts the federal land coal leasing moratorium and reviews regulations related to oil and gas development on federal and Indian lands. The order concludes with general provisions clarifying its implementation and stating that it does not create any substantive or procedural rights enforceable against the United States.
