The White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Center for Open Data Enterprise recently co-hosted a roundtable on Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset, a new Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal in the President's Management Agenda (PMA). The goal is to unlock federal data in ways that improve government services, inform policy, create value and jobs in the economy, and make government more effective and efficient. The event brought together federal and industry data experts to begin crafting a strategy for achieving these goals. The Deputy Director of Management at OMB, Margaret Weichert, emphasized the importance of federal data in growing the economy and increasing government effectiveness and transparency. The roundtable discussions focused on the need to view the nation's data as a strategic asset and find ways to leverage it to its full potential. The goal is to develop a federal data strategy that strengthens the government's ability to provide and use data for mission accountability and economic growth, while ensuring privacy and confidentiality are protected. The administration is committed to delivering a comprehensive federal data strategy with short-term and long-term visions for implementation. The strategy will be developed through an inclusive process involving experts and thought-leaders from government, industry, non-profit, and research sectors. The roundtable is the first step in this process. The administration has also taken steps to push IT modernization to the forefront, aligning with the goal of leveraging data. The roundtable marks progress against all three pillars of the PMA. A report on the learnings and next steps from the discussion will be released in the coming weeks.
