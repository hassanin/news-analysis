The White House, Department of Defense, and Department of Veterans Affairs have released a web video in which President Obama encourages active duty troops and veterans who had their service extended due to 'stop loss' to apply for special retroactive pay. The deadline for application is October 21, and eligible individuals can submit their applications to www.defense.gov/stoploss. The retroactive pay is $500 per month for each month their service was extended between September 11, 2001 and September 30, 2009. The Obama Administration has been working to provide better healthcare, services, and support for veterans, including funding increases for the VA, eliminating co-pays for the catastrophically disabled, and improving the delivery of services. They have also helped veterans transition back to civilian life through the post-9/11 GI Bill and provided resources for treating traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The administration has also made it easier for veterans suffering from PTSD to qualify for VA benefits and eliminated obstacles for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange to access healthcare and benefits.
