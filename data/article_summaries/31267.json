During a press briefing on Air Force One, White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters addressed several topics. First, she expressed condolences for the shooting at the Capital Gazette Newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, and stated that the President has been briefed on the situation. Walters also highlighted the upcoming ceremony at the White House to mark the six-month anniversary of the tax cuts becoming law, as well as the groundbreaking of the Foxconn plant in Wisconsin. She mentioned that more than 300,000 new manufacturing jobs have been created since President Trump took office. Walters also thanked Justice Anthony Kennedy for his service and stated that the process to find his replacement has begun. When asked about the President's timeline for making an announcement, Walters said the President takes the process very seriously and will pick a nominee from the list previously released. She also refuted a report that the President is looking to replace Chief of Staff John Kelly, stating that the article is inaccurate. Walters provided updates on the reunification of families at the border and the upcoming meeting between President Trump and President Putin. She declined to comment on whether the President believes Putin's denial of election interference and whether he will demand that Russia return Crimea to Ukraine. Walters also stated that the court ruling on family reunification highlights the need for congressional action on immigration and mentioned that the President is focused on fair and reciprocal trade with the European Union. She did not confirm reports of the President campaigning in Montana or comment on reports of North Korea's nuclear site improvements. Walters emphasized that the White House condemns violence and reiterated that there is no room for violence in the country.
