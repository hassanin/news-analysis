On November 14, 1994, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency due to the threat posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such weapons. This national emergency was further amended in 1998 and 2005 to respond effectively to the worldwide threat of proliferation activities related to weapons of mass destruction. The President states that the proliferation of these weapons and their means of delivery continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 1994 must continue beyond November 14, 2020, for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
