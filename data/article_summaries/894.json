On National Rural Health Day, President Joe Biden emphasizes the commitment to delivering quality and affordable healthcare to every area in America. The goals include making insurance and prescription drugs more affordable, expanding mental health and substance use disorder services, and ensuring that rural facilities remain open and staffed with dedicated healthcare professionals.

The article acknowledges that progress has been made, but challenges still exist. Rural hospitals and clinics have been closing, resulting in trauma patients having to travel longer distances for care and experiencing higher fatality rates compared to urban areas. These closures also have negative impacts on rural economies, as hospitals are often major employers in these areas. Additionally, hunger and diet-related diseases are more prevalent in rural areas, further exacerbating health inequities. The COVID-19 pandemic has further strained the already stretched healthcare system.

President Biden's administration is working to address these issues. The American Rescue Plan allocated $8.5 billion to assist rural providers in covering the rising costs associated with COVID-19. This funding has helped keep rural hospitals and clinics open and has allowed nearly 700,000 previously uninsured rural Americans to gain healthcare coverage. The administration has also established a new Rural Emergency Hospital designation with additional Medicare reimbursement to improve access to emergency and outpatient care. Furthermore, $1.5 billion has been allocated for scholarships and student loan assistance for rural clinicians and nurses, including members of the National Health Service Corps. The administration has launched a program to train rural providers through the Department of Veterans Affairs to better serve the millions of veterans residing in rural areas. Investments in rural broadband and telehealth services have been made to enhance access to healthcare in remote areas.

Efforts are also being made to expand mental health and substance use disorder services, support community health centers, train specialists, and reduce the stigma associated with these conditions. Addressing the mental health crisis and the drug overdose epidemic in rural America are priorities for the administration.

Additionally, the administration is working on ensuring that no child in America goes hungry and that families can trust the safety of their drinking water. The first White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in over 50 years was convened, and a national strategy to combat hunger and improve nutrition for all Americans was released. The strategy includes providing free and healthy school meals for all children and increasing access to local foods, benefiting both rural families and local farmers. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, efforts are being made to replace lead pipes, eliminate lead paint, and provide clean water to every home in the country.

President Biden emphasizes that rural Americans deserve access to healthcare without worrying about the distance to the nearest hospital or the potential migration of their children and jobs due to inadequate healthcare. He views healthcare as a right, not a privilege, and vows to continue fighting for the health and well-being of rural Americans.

In conclusion, President Biden has proclaimed November 17, 2022, as National Rural Health Day, calling upon the people of the United States to reaffirm their dedication to the health and well-being of rural America.
