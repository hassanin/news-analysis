The Biden-Harris Administration has secured voluntary commitments from seven leading AI companies - Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI - to promote safe, secure, and transparent development of AI technology. These commitments focus on three principles - safety, security, and trust - and aim to ensure that AI innovation does not compromise Americans' rights and safety. The Administration will continue to remind companies of their responsibilities and take action to keep Americans safe. Additionally, the Administration is developing an executive order and bipartisan legislation to support responsible innovation. The United States also aims to establish an international framework with allies and partners to govern AI development and use. The announcement is part of the Administration's broader commitment to ensuring safe and responsible AI development and protecting Americans from harm and discrimination.
