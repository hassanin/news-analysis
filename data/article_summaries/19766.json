President Obama welcomes Pope Francis's encyclical on climate change and expresses admiration for the Pope's strong stance on the issue. The President believes that the United States should take a leadership role in addressing climate change by cutting carbon pollution, increasing clean energy and efficiency, and protecting vulnerable communities. He also emphasizes the need to protect the world's poor, who are most affected by climate change. President Obama looks forward to discussing these issues with the Pope during his visit to the White House in September, and hopes that world leaders will heed the Pope's call to care for our common home as they prepare for global climate negotiations in Paris.
