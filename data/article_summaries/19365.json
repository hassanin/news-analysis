President Obama visited the University of Iowa to deliver remarks and participate in a roundtable discussion with five students who are currently receiving Stafford federal student loans. The students shared their stories and how doubling interest rates would negatively impact them. The students included Myranda Burnett, a junior majoring in Therapeutic Recreation who would be the first in her family to receive a degree, Blake Anderson, a junior majoring in Finance who is planning to graduate early to keep his student loans low, Jordan Garrison-Nickerson, a sophomore with a double major in accounting and communications who would not have been able to attend college without Stafford federal student loans, Marissa Boles, a senior majoring in Psychology who has worked part-time to pay for her education and hopes to continue working in child psychology, and Martin Lopez, a sophomore majoring in Social Work who is actively involved on campus and would not be able to attend the university without financial aid.
