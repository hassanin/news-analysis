After years of being wrongfully detained in Venezuela, seven individuals are being brought back to the United States. The individuals, Jorge Toledo, Tomeu Vadell, Alirio Zambrano, Jose Luis Zambrano, Jose Pereira, Matthew Heath, and Osman Khan, will soon be reunited with their families. The U.S. Government has played a crucial role in securing their release and remains committed to helping Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained worldwide. The President signed an executive order this summer to impose sanctions and visa bans on those responsible for such acts. The State Department has also introduced a new warning indicator, "D", to inform Americans about travel destinations that may have an increased risk of wrongful detention. Travelers who decide to go despite the warning should be aware of the personal risks involved, as the U.S. Government may not be able to secure their release.
