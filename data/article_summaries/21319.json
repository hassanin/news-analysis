President Obama has issued an executive order on preventing and responding to violence against women and girls globally. The order aims to enhance the rights and status of women and girls, promote gender equality in U.S. foreign policy, and create a world without violence. The order establishes an interagency working group, led by the Secretary of State and the Administrator of USAID, to implement the new United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-based Violence Globally. The strategy focuses on increased coordination among U.S. government agencies and stakeholders, integrating prevention and response efforts into existing work, improving data and research, and expanding programming. The working group includes representatives from various government departments and agencies. This strategy builds upon existing efforts and complements ongoing initiatives, such as promoting gender equality in national security and foreign policy, addressing gender-based violence in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, and combating human trafficking.
