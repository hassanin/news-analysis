President Donald Trump has taken action to protect the American automobile industry, its workforce, and American innovation. This action comes after a review of the Department of Commerce's Section 232 automobile report, which concluded that imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts pose a threat to the national security of the United States. The President has directed the United States Trade Representative to negotiate agreements to address this threat, with a 180-day deadline. If agreements are not reached within this timeframe, further action will be determined by the President. The competitiveness of the automobile industry and the research and development it generates are crucial to United States defense and military superiority.
