Earnest mentions that the United States welcomes the announcement by the United Nations to convene the Geneva Conference on Syria in January 2014. The goal of the conference is to bring the Syrian government and opposition to a negotiating table for the first time since the start of the conflict. Earnest also states that the President still believes that Bashar Assad needs to go and that the Syrian people believe the same. Regarding Iran, Earnest explains that the US is ready to begin conversations with the Iranians to resolve differences regarding their nuclear program. The US wants to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon and that there is an inspection regime in place to verify this.
