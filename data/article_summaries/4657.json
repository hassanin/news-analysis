On July 26, 2019, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the situation in Mali. This was done through Executive Order 13882, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The national emergency was declared to address the unusual and extraordinary threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by the situation in Mali. The reasons for this declaration include repeated violations of ceasefire arrangements, the expansion of terrorist activities, drug trafficking, human rights abuses, hostage-taking, and attacks against civilians, the Malian defense and security forces, and international security presences. The President has determined that the national emergency must continue beyond July 26, 2021, and has therefore extended it for one year, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
