President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of California and ordered Federal aid to support recovery efforts in areas affected by wildfires since August 14, 2020. The declaration makes Federal funding available to individuals in the counties of Lake, Napa, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Solano, Sonoma, and Yolo. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid individuals and business owners in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation statewide. Willie G. Nunn has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the affected counties can start applying for assistance online or by phone. The FEMA News Desk can be contacted for further information.
