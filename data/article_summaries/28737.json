President Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Mississippi due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred on January 20-21, 2017. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. This includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other assistance programs for individuals and business owners. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Joe M. Girot has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage surveys are still ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling the toll-free numbers provided. The numbers will be available from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week until further notice. For further information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
