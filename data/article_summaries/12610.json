President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Colorado, providing federal aid for recovery efforts from severe storms, tornadoes, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred between May 4 and June 16, 2015. The funding will be available to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding. Dolph A. Diemont has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
