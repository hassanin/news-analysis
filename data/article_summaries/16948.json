President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Iowa due to severe storms and flooding that occurred in July 2011. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Michael R. Scott has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
