President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Arkansas, authorizing federal aid to support the recovery efforts following a severe winter storm that occurred on December 25-26, 2012. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, to assist with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Garland, Grant, Hot Spring, Lonoke, Perry, Pulaski, and Saline. Additionally, federal funding will be available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Sandy Coachman as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Further designations may be made in the future based on additional damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
