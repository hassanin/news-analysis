This memorandum, issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., extends federal support to governors' use of the National Guard to respond to COVID-19 and increases reimbursement and other assistance provided to states. The policy of the administration is to combat and respond to COVID-19 with the full capacity and capability of the federal government, while also assisting state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments to do the same. The Secretary of Defense is directed to request that all governors order National Guard forces to fulfill mission assignments issued by FEMA on a fully reimbursable basis. FEMA will fund 100% of the cost of activities associated with these mission assignments. The memorandum also provides assistance for emergency protective measures, such as the safe opening and operation of schools, healthcare facilities, and transit systems. FEMA will make this assistance available under the Public Assistance program with a 100% federal cost share until September 30, 2021. To expedite reimbursements, FEMA will provide advance reimbursement for eligible emergency work projects. The 100% federal cost share for the use of National Guard forces will be available for orders authorizing duty through September 30, 2021. The memorandum includes general provisions and is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations.
