The United States Senate has passed the bipartisan Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022, which aims to provide expanded access to health care and disability benefits for veterans affected by toxic exposures. The bill also allows the Department of Veterans Affairs to determine if illnesses are related to military service more quickly and comprehensively, and offers support to survivors harmed by exposures, including water contamination at Camp LeJeune. The legislation is part of the Unity Agenda outlined in the State of the Union address and is the largest single bill in American history addressing service members' exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances. The House is urged to pass the bill swiftly so it can be signed into law.
