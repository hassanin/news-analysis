The United States has deployed approximately 80 armed forces personnel to Libreville, Gabon, in order to support the security of US citizens, personnel, and diplomatic facilities in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. This deployment is a response to the potential for violent demonstrations following the December 30, 2018, elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The personnel arrived in Gabon on January 2, 2019, with appropriate combat equipment and additional forces may be deployed if necessary. The personnel will remain in the region until the security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo improves. President Donald Trump states that this action was taken to protect US citizens and in line with national security and foreign policy interests. He also mentions that he is providing this report to keep Congress informed, as required by the War Powers Resolution.
