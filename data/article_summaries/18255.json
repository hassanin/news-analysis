The White House hosted the first-ever Arctic Science Ministerial, where Science Ministers from 25 governments and the European Union discussed Arctic research priorities. They signed a Joint Statement on increased international collaboration on Arctic science and inclusion of Indigenous peoples in understanding and responding to changes in the Arctic. The Ministers highlighted several new initiatives, including the release of the first ever Arctic-wide digital elevation model, the development of an Integrated Arctic Observing System, and the initiation of projects to understand the impact of the changing Arctic on weather and climate. The Ministers also emphasized the need for increased monitoring and research to better understand the causes and consequences of the rapidly changing Arctic environment. They discussed the importance of strengthening and integrating Arctic observations and data-sharing, as well as applying expanded scientific understanding of the Arctic to build regional resilience and shape global responses. The Ministers also recognized the importance of empowering citizens through STEM education leveraging Arctic science. Overall, the ASM aimed to deepen international collaborations and increase the pace of discovery in the Arctic.
