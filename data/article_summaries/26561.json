President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order with respect to Iran, taking additional steps in response to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995. The order implements certain requirements of various Iran-related legislation, including the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, and the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012. The President's order reimposes and extends sanctions that were lifted pursuant to a previous Executive Order, and continues the effect of certain implementation authorities for other legislation. The order aims to deny Iran the ability to develop or acquire a nuclear weapon, neutralize its campaign of regional aggression, disrupt the activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, and impede its development of longer-range missiles and other weapons capabilities. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, has been delegated the authority to take necessary actions to carry out the purposes of the order.
