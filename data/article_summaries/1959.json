On World Suicide Prevention Day, President Joe Biden expresses his condolences and support for those affected by suicide in the United States. He acknowledges that there is no single cause or solution to suicide but emphasizes the importance of access to support and treatment. The administration is committed to expanding suicide prevention programs to reach every community and ensuring that all Americans receive the care and support they deserve. The mental health crisis is a priority for the administration, and they are working to address the risk factors associated with suicide. The goal is to transform how mental health is understood, accessed, treated, and integrated into healthcare settings. The statistics on suicide in America are alarming, with over 48,000 Americans lost to suicide in 2021, and millions considering or attempting suicide. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth and young adults, and the rate among veterans is significantly higher than among non-veterans. However, access to mental health treatment is often limited and expensive. Less than half of adults with mental illness receive care, and nearly 70 percent of children who seek mental health or substance use care are unable to access it. The administration has proposed steps to expand access to mental health care, including requiring health insurance plans to identify and address gaps in mental health care coverage. President Biden acknowledges the despair felt by families who lack the means to get help for their loved ones and emphasizes the need for health insurers to cover mental health crises on par with physical health conditions. The American Rescue Plan has allocated funds to expand mental health and substance use services, and measures have been taken to increase the availability of school psychologists and counselors, as well as establish helplines for maternal mental health and national suicide and crisis support. Efforts are also being made to invest in mental health care and suicide prevention for service members, veterans, and first responders. President Biden calls on all Americans, communities, organizations, and levels of government to take action in preventing suicide and ensuring accessible and affordable help and support for every American.
