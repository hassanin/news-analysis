Consumer confidence in the US rose in August to its highest level since October 2000, according to a report by the Conference Board. The percentage of consumers expecting business conditions to improve over the next six months increased to 24.3% from 22.9% in July. Economists believe that these high confidence levels will continue to support healthy consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of US economic activity.
