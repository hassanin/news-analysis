The White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed disagreement with the Supreme Court's decision to stay the Clean Power Plan during ongoing litigation. Earnest argued that the plan is legally and technically sound and provides states with the necessary time and flexibility to develop cost-effective strategies to reduce emissions. He also emphasized the plan's potential benefits, including improved air quality, public health, clean energy investment, job creation, and progress in addressing climate change. The administration remains confident in its ability to succeed in court. Despite the litigation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will work with states that choose to continue plan development and provide the necessary tools. Additionally, the administration will continue taking aggressive measures to reduce carbon emissions.
