On World Suicide Prevention Day, the United States commits to expanding access to crisis intervention and mental health treatment options. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the country, with one death occurring every 12.3 minutes on average. The government particularly focuses on supporting veterans, as 20 of them tragically take their own lives every day. More service members have died by suicide than in combat in recent years. The government aims to provide world-class healthcare to veterans. Suicide leaves behind sorrow among families, friends, colleagues, classmates, and neighbors, but communities can prevent suicides by openly discussing the issue, recognizing risk factors, and providing help to those in need. The nation strives to prevent loss of life caused by suicides and aims to help Americans experience the joyful life that is possible in the country.
