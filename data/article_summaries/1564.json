President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed the establishment of the Castner Range National Monument in El Paso, Texas. The monument, located on Fort Bliss, encompasses approximately 6,672 acres and is home to significant archeological, paleontological, biological, and geological resources. It contains evidence of the area's historical role in the military, as well as archeological sites documenting the presence of Indigenous Peoples dating back to 6,000 B.C. The monument also provides habitat for various plant and animal species, including endangered ones. The Department of the Army will manage the monument and develop a management plan in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior. Military munitions response actions will be conducted in a phased manner to ensure public safety, and the protection of sacred sites and traditional cultural properties will be prioritized in collaboration with Tribal Nations. The establishment of the monument does not affect valid existing rights or the jurisdiction of the State of Texas or any Tribal Nation.
