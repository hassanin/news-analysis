The Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new commitments to workforce development from the Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Sprint. This initiative aims to build a diverse and skilled pipeline of workers for advanced manufacturing jobs, including union jobs that do not require a four-year college degree. The administration's Investing in America agenda, which includes various acts and plans, has created a strong demand for skilled workers in clean energy, biotechnology, semiconductors, and more.

Neera Tanden, Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, will highlight these commitments in remarks to community college and labor leaders. Over 160 organizations, including community colleges, employers, unions, and philanthropic organizations, are participating in the Sprint. They are taking tangible steps to help more Americans train for and succeed in advanced manufacturing careers.

The administration continues to encourage and support the expansion of high-quality pathways into advanced manufacturing and invites more organizations to join the Sprint. They are also highlighting concrete actions taken by Sprint participants and agencies to expand pathways into these jobs. Additionally, there are new federal investments to expand and diversify the advanced manufacturing workforce.

The Advanced Manufacturing Sprint is part of the administration's broader efforts to address workforce development and job quality improvement. Previous sprints have focused on expanding apprenticeships in trucking and cybersecurity, as well as building pathways into jobs in broadband, electrification, and construction. The Sprint aligns with the administration's plan to expand education and training opportunities in biotechnology and biomanufacturing.
