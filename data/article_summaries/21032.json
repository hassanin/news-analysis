The White House has released a statement applauding the bipartisan efforts of Senators Alexander and Murray to replace the No Child Left Behind Act. The statement emphasizes President Obama's commitment to providing schools with more flexibility, investing in effective teaching methods, promoting innovation in education, and expanding access to high-quality preschool. The White House believes that any new legislation should focus on transparency in school performance, reject proposals that would take funding away from underprivileged schools, and prioritize closing achievement and opportunity gaps.
