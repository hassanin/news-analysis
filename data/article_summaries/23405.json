President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Montana, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that occurred between April and May 2011. The declaration allows for federal funding to be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures in various counties and reservations within the state. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA.
