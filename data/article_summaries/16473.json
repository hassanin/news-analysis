The article discusses a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process. The letter states that Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act allows for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless the President publishes a notice stating that it is to continue. The national emergency was initially declared on January 23, 1995, due to grave acts of violence committed by foreign terrorists. The crisis has not been resolved, as terrorist groups continue to engage in activities that threaten the peace process and are hostile to US interests in the region. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain economic sanctions against these terrorists.
