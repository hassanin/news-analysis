The White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative (CVIC) held its final national meeting, which was attended by mayors, law enforcement leaders, CVI experts, and representatives from philanthropic institutions. The CVIC is a cohort of 16 jurisdictions committed to using funding to scale and strengthen their community violence intervention (CVI) infrastructure. CVIC has helped CVI organizations advance their work by providing technical assistance and making them more competitive for grant funding. The Biden Administration reaffirmed its commitment to community violence interventions and called for Congress to provide $5 billion over 10 years for these programs. The CVIC initiative, announced in June 2021, aimed to enhance partnerships and coordination among jurisdictions and facilitate peer-to-peer learning on effective community-based public safety strategies. Various national experts and federal agencies are providing training and technical assistance to help communities assess their public safety ecosystem and expand programming to address gun violence. The CVI Collaborative includes jurisdictions such as Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. Philanthropic organizations supporting CVIC include Arnold Ventures, Ford Foundation, and Open Society Foundations, among others.
