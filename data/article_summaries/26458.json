The United States is committed to promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region where nations uphold the international rules-based order. The illegal fishing and harassment by China in the exclusive economic zones of other countries in the Indo-Pacific threaten the sovereignty and stability of the region. To counter these actions, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) is modernizing its fleet of major cutters and strategically homeporting enhanced Fast Response Cutters in the western Pacific. These cutters will conduct maritime security missions, enhance domain awareness, collaborate with regional partners, and ensure freedom of navigation. In Fiscal Year 2021, the USCG plans to evaluate the feasibility of basing Fast Response Cutters in American Samoa, which could further expand the US presence in the South Pacific. The goal is to enhance the USCG's capacity and presence in the Indo-Pacific to remain the preferred maritime partner in the region.
