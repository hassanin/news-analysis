President Donald Trump spoke with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and confirmed that Turkey will proceed with its planned operation in Northern Syria. The United States will not support or be involved in the operation, as the US forces have already defeated the ISIS territorial "Caliphate" and will no longer be present in the immediate area. The US government has urged European nations, including France and Germany, to take back the captured ISIS fighters from their countries, but they have refused. As a result, Turkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters captured in the area over the past two years.
