The Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers provides an analysis of the U.S. economy in 2017 and outlines the Administration's economic policy priorities for the coming years. The report highlights the strong growth in real GDP in 2017, exceeding expectations and reaching 2.5 percent, with two successive quarters above 3.0 percent. The unemployment rate also fell to its lowest level since December 2000 at 4.1 percent, and 2.2 million jobs were added. The report identifies policy factors that have hindered investment and labor productivity, such as an internationally uncompetitive U.S. corporate tax code, excessive regulations, and labor market challenges. It also discusses the benefits of tax cuts, regulatory reform, infrastructure investment, and reciprocal trade agreements. The report emphasizes the importance of improving health outcomes and addressing cybersecurity threats. The Administration's policy-inclusive forecast predicts an average annual real GDP growth of 3.0 percent through 2028, with expected moderation after 2020. The report concludes by endorsing an agenda to return the American economy to its full growth potential.
