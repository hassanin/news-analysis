President Obama has announced the appointment of Ambassador Princeton N. Lyman as the new U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan. Ambassador Lyman has extensive experience working on African challenges and is well-suited to continue efforts in Sudan. The President also thanked the previous Special Envoy, Scott Gration, for his work. Ambassador Lyman will oversee the implementation of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, tensions between north and south Sudan, the birth of an independent South Sudan, and an end to the conflict in Darfur. The President has confidence in Ambassador Lyman's abilities and believes his knowledge of Africa will benefit U.S. interests and the Sudanese people during this transformative time.
