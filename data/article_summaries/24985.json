The United States and Brazil are working together to facilitate travel and exchange between the two countries. In 2011, a record number of Brazilians visited the United States, making Brazil the fourth largest source of overseas visitors. The Department of State has been taking action to expand the ties between the two nations. Visa issuances to Brazilians have tripled between 2006 and 2011, and are expected to continue increasing in 2012. The Department of Commerce forecasts that 2.8 million Brazilians will travel to the United States in 2016. Visa interview wait times have significantly decreased, and the Department of State plans to open new consulates in Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre to further facilitate travel and trade. They are also investing in improving facilities and increasing consular staffing to meet the growing demand. Additionally, a pilot program is being implemented to waive in-person interviews for certain qualified individuals, streamlining the visa process.
