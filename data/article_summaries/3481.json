In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declares February as National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. He highlights the various forms of teen dating violence, such as physical assault, sexual assault, stalking, emotional abuse, and harassment. The article emphasizes that this violence can occur in person, online, or through technology. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that more than 8 percent of high school students in the United States experience physical or sexual dating violence. Young women and LGBTQI+ youth face the highest rates. Survivors of teen dating violence may suffer from depression, substance abuse, suicidal tendencies, eating disorders, poor academic outcomes, unintended pregnancy, and other difficulties. The article also mentions that survivors of teenage dating violence are more likely to be revictimized as adults. Girls and young women of color face additional barriers to seeking help and are less frequently recognized as survivors of dating and sexual violence. President Biden's administration pledges support for programs that promote safe and healthy relationships among preteens and teens. They have released resources to aid communities in preventing and addressing teen dating violence, including tools for online safety, response to abuse on college campuses, and training programs that prevent abuse and encourage healthy relationships. The administration also enforces Title IX protections for students based on gender identity and sexual orientation, particularly supporting transgender students who experience higher rates of violence. The proclamation urges individuals to educate themselves and others about teen dating violence to work together in ending it.
