The article is a press briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney and Assistant to the President for Manufacturing Policy Ron Bloom. They discuss a report on the auto industry and its progress after measures taken by the President two years prior. The report shows that the Detroit Three automakers have gained market share, added jobs, and shown the ability to make money. The President's decision to stand behind these companies and provide assistance was a difficult one, but it has led to positive signs of progress. The future of the industry is not assured, but steps have been taken to position the companies for success. The briefing also touches on the President's meeting with House Republicans and the need to raise the debt ceiling.
