The article discusses the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade and highlights the fact that last year, the Supreme Court took away a constitutional right from the American people. It mentions that Americans have consistently expressed their belief that women should be able to make personal decisions without political interference. However, Republicans in Congress and across the country are pushing for a national abortion ban, criminalizing doctors and nurses, and limiting access to contraception. The article argues that these efforts are dangerous, extreme, and out of touch. The author pledges to continue fighting to protect a woman's right to choose and emphasizes the need for Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law to ensure this right in every state.
