President Obama congratulated Congressman John Dingell on becoming the longest-serving member of Congress in U.S. history. Dingell, who was first elected in 1955, has worked tirelessly for the people of Michigan and for working families across America. He has played a significant role in passing important laws, such as Medicare, the Civil Rights Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Affordable Care Act. Dingell continues to advocate for workers' rights, affordable healthcare, and environmental preservation. President Obama and his wife, Michelle, send their warmest wishes to Dingell and his family, and the president looks forward to congratulating him in person at the White House.
