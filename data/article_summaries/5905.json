President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566 with respect to Libya will continue beyond February 25, 2021. The ongoing instability in Libya, stemming from actions taken by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his associates in 2011, requires the protection of Libyan state assets to prevent them from being misappropriated by parties seeking to undermine the United Nations' peace process. This instability benefits terrorist groups such as ISIS and poses a threat to the national security of the United States and its regional partners. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency in Libya.
