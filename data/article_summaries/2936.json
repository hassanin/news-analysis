The article discusses President Biden's executive order to reverse the ban on transgender individuals serving in the United States military. The order states that all qualified Americans should be able to serve in the Armed Forces, regardless of their gender identity. It emphasizes that there is no meaningful negative impact on military readiness or healthcare costs by allowing transgender individuals to serve openly. The previous administration's policy to bar transgender individuals from serving was deemed unnecessary and based on a flawed review. The order directs the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that all directives, orders, and policies are consistent with the new policy. It also prohibits involuntary separations, discharges, and denials of reenlistment based on gender identity and instructs the correction of military records for individuals affected by the previous ban. The Secretaries are required to report on the progress of implementation within 60 days. The order does not create any new rights or benefits enforceable against the United States.
