Senator Graham has introduced a national ban on abortion, a move that is seen as a threat to women's rights. The bill goes against the beliefs of many Americans and is criticized for taking away rights from women. In contrast, President Biden and Vice President Harris are focused on passing the Inflation Reduction Act and addressing issues such as the cost of prescription drugs, healthcare, and climate change. Democrats are committed to restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade and ensuring that healthcare decisions remain with women and their doctors, despite efforts by elected Republicans to intervene.
