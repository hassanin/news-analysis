The Biden-Harris Administration is taking six initial actions to address the gun violence public health epidemic in the United States. These actions include proposing rules to stop the proliferation of "ghost guns" and regulating devices that can turn pistols into short-barreled rifles. The administration will also publish model legislation for states to adopt "red flag" laws, invest in evidence-based community violence interventions, issue an annual report on firearms trafficking, and nominate David Chipman as Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. President Biden is also calling on Congress to pass legislation to reduce gun violence, including closing background check loopholes and banning assault weapons.
