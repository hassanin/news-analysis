The memorandum also includes general provisions, clarifying that it does not impair existing authorities or affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. The Administrator of FEMA is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
