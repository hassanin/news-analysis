The White House has announced over $80 million in new federal investment and a doubling of participating communities in the Smart Cities Initiative. The initiative aims to make it easier for cities, federal agencies, universities, and the private sector to work together to develop and test new technologies that can make cities more inhabitable, cleaner, and more equitable. The new investments and collaborations will focus on key areas such as climate, transportation, public safety, and transforming city services. The funding will support projects such as energy and climate challenges, urban transportation, public safety and disaster response, and the adoption of innovative social programs. The initiative is part of the Administration's efforts to develop a smarter and more collaborative approach to working with local communities.
