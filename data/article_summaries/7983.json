Today, on the anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), the Biden-Harris Administration celebrates the progress made through VAWA in addressing sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. President Biden has consistently prioritized preventing and addressing gender-based violence throughout his career, and his commitment to this cause has remained steadfast. In 2023, he implemented bipartisan military justice reform and issued the first-ever U.S. National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence. President Biden has also worked across the aisle to reauthorize and strengthen VAWA since first championing it in 1994. With each reauthorization, VAWA has been expanded to improve safety and support for survivors, increase prevention efforts, and inspire social change. Most recently, President Biden signed the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022 and secured the highest-ever funding level for VAWA implementation. The Biden-Harris Administration has been working diligently over the past year to implement the changes passed as part of the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022.
