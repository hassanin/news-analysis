On World Teachers' Day, First Lady Jill Biden will be appearing on The Kelly Clarkson Show and participating in Pinterest's livestream to celebrate teachers. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to elevating and supporting the teaching profession. The American Rescue Plan provided $122 billion to K-12 schools, and the administration has urged states and districts to use these funds to increase compensation for teachers, invest in teacher pipeline programs, and hire more professionals in education. The ARP has helped create 261,000 more jobs in local education and increased the number of school social workers, counselors, and nurses. ARP funds are also being used to improve working conditions for teachers and learning conditions for students. The administration has also made additional federal investments in teacher recruitment and preparation, including grants for high-quality teacher preparation programs and support for teacher pipeline and development programs. The Department of Labor has committed to prioritizing the education sector in apprenticeship funding. The administration is also working to ensure that education jobs are good jobs by advocating for better pay and proposing increased funding for Title I schools. They are also taking action to reduce student debt for teachers.
