The Presidential Task Force on Protecting Native American Children in the Indian Health Service System recently held its third meeting in Montana. During the meeting, the Task Force discussed institutional vulnerabilities in Indian Country healthcare services and jurisdictional challenges and investigative processes related to suspected child abuse cases. They also visited the Blackfeet Community Hospital to assess protocols and practices, recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals, and reporting mechanisms for child abuse. The Task Force then traveled to Great Falls, Montana, where they met with a multi-disciplinary team focusing on crimes against Native American children. At the conclusion of the meeting, individual members were assigned to conduct further inquiries and develop policy recommendations for the final report to the President. The Task Force was established in March 2019 to examine factors contributing to the failure to prevent the abuse of Native American children in the care of the Indian Health Services. It is co-chaired by Joseph Grogan and Trent Shores, and includes members with diverse expertise and experiences. The Task Force operates independently from other investigations into the Indian Health Services, including the criminal investigation of a pediatrician and reviews conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services and an independent contractor.
