President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New York and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that occurred between May 13 and May 22, 2014. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to assist with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The funding is available on a cost-sharing basis and covers various counties in New York. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Steven S. Ward as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, with the possibility of additional designations in the future based on further damage assessments.
