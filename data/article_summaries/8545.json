The President will announce in the State of the Union address a plan to crack down on COVID-19 fraud and serious identity theft of public benefits. The administration aims to prevent, deter, and punish criminal syndicates involved in these activities. The expansion of pandemic relief in 2020 led to a rise in foreign and domestic criminal syndicates defrauding unemployment insurance and other benefits programs, resulting in the loss of billions of dollars meant for small businesses and workers. The Federal Trade Commission reported a 3000% increase in reports of identity theft involving public benefits from 2019 to 2020. The administration has already taken significant actions to address this issue.
