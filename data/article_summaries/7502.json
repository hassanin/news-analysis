One year ago, the people of Belarus held an election to shape their own future. However, the Lukashenka regime committed election fraud and then launched a brutal campaign to suppress dissent. This included detaining peaceful protesters, imprisoning activists, civil society leaders, and journalists, and even diverting an international flight. These actions are an illegitimate attempt to hold onto power at any cost. It is the responsibility of those who value human rights, free and fair elections, and freedom of expression to oppose this oppression. The United States is taking action by issuing a new Executive Order that strengthens their ability to impose consequences on the Lukashenka regime and imposing sanctions on Belarusian individuals and entities involved in attacks on democracy, human rights, repression, and corruption. The United States, along with allies and partners, will continue to support human rights and free expression and stand with the people of Belarus in their pursuit of democracy.
