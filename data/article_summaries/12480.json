The White House is announcing over $120 million in funding to support the growth of clean energy in 24 states across the country. This funding will help promote the use of smart, simple, and low-cost technologies to transition to cleaner energy sources, save on energy bills, and address climate change. The actions taken by the Administration build upon previous executive actions and private sector commitments to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy and promote energy efficiency. The funding will drive the development of affordable clean energy and has already resulted in significant growth in the solar industry, with the number of homes with rooftop solar increasing from 66,000 to 734,000 since President Obama took office. The funding will support various initiatives, including bringing new solar technologies to market, spurring the next generation of solar technology, supporting local governments in driving up solar adoption, cutting the time it takes to install solar energy on households, increasing concentrating solar power, improving the quality of solar panels, expanding access to solar in rural areas, and highlighting veterans in the solar energy workforce. Additionally, the Department of Energy's State Energy Program has awarded $5 million to 11 states to advance clean energy development and reduce energy bills.
