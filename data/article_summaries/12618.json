Vice President Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Yanukovych about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Biden urged Yanukovych to sign the parliament's repeal of certain laws without delay and encouraged him to work with the opposition to find compromises for a peaceful solution. These compromises include an amnesty law and the formation of a new government that can bring political unity and strengthen democratic institutions. The goal is to take Ukraine in the direction of Europe and achieve economic prosperity through necessary reforms.
