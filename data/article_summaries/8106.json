President Joseph R. Biden has declared a major disaster for the La Jolla Band of Luise√±o Indians, providing federal aid to supplement their efforts in areas affected by Tropical Storm Hilary in August 2023. The federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Andrew F. Grant from FEMA has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations, and further designations may be made if requested by the tribe and warranted by damage assessments.
