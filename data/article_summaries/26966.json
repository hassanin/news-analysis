President Donald J. Trump is signing an Executive Order to enhance the effectiveness of Federal Agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs) in improving agency information technology. Past legislation has attempted to consolidate agencies' IT spending, but the success of implementing reforms has varied from agency to agency. Federal agencies have struggled to improve information technology, resulting in backward-looking and wasteful spending. The goal is to embrace big change, bold thinking, and outsider perspectives to transform government and make it more efficient and cost-effective.
