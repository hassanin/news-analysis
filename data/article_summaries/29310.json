President Donald J. Trump commends the House of Representatives for passing the VA MISSION Act, which aims to modernize and improve the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system. The legislation will enhance the quality of care for VA patients, invest in VA assets, and allocate $5.2 billion to prevent any disruptions for veterans currently using the Choice Program. The President urges the Senate to prioritize the needs of veterans and pass this crucial legislation before Memorial Day, to ensure that veterans receive the timely care they deserve, without enduring long wait times.
