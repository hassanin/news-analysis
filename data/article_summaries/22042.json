Officials from the Obama Administration are visiting over 35 communities this week to assess the achievements and employment generated with the Recovery Act one year after its enactment. The President, Vice President, and agency officials will propose additional measures to increase the successes of the Recovery Act and generate more jobs. The events will include meetings and discussions with governors, mayors, and members of Congress in over 25 states. The President will commemorate the anniversary at the White House on Wednesday, where he will be joined by Americans from across the country who have benefited from the Recovery Act. The Vice President is spending the day in Saginaw, MI, hearing from local residents about how the Recovery Act is helping this affected community, formerly dedicated to the automotive sector, to renew itself and be competitive in the 21st-century economy. Government officials will discuss how the President's additional job creation proposals will build on the previous achievements of the Recovery Act to generate more jobs and promote further economic growth. Many of the President's proposals, from assistance to small businesses to additional investment in energy-efficient equipment upgrades, are expansions or extensions of some of the most popular and effective programs of the Recovery Act. The Recovery Act was enacted by President Obama on February 17, 2009. The program is a combination of tax cuts, economic assistance, and infrastructure projects designed to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn and lay the foundation for economic recovery. Public and private experts estimate that the program is already responsible for approximately 2 million jobs, putting it on track to support over 3.5 million jobs by the end of 2010.
