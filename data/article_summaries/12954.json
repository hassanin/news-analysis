President Obama signed an Executive Order to renew and enhance the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics. The new order provides a better structure for the initiative to take action and forge partnerships between the public, private, and non-profit sectors in local communities. An enhanced inter-agency working group and a 30-member Presidential advisory commission will work with the initiative to bring the voice of the American people into the policy-making process. The new order is based on feedback gathered from community conversations and comments from over 10,000 Americans. The initiative aims to address the educational challenges faced by Hispanic students, such as low participation in early childhood education programs and low high school graduation rates. The signing ceremony follows a National Education Summit and Call to Action hosted by the U.S. Department of Education.
