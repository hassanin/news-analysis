On World AIDS Day, the Biden-Harris Administration reflects on the global and U.S. losses due to AIDS-related illnesses, honors the 38 million individuals living with HIV, and celebrates the progress made in combating the disease. The administration is committed to implementing the updated National HIV/AIDS Strategy and ending the HIV epidemic both domestically and abroad. They are also releasing a new strategy for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) globally. In the past year, the administration has taken action to accelerate domestic HIV efforts, respond to HIV/AIDS globally, address stigma and discrimination, ensure equity, support and treat at-risk individuals for syndemic illnesses, and advance new research. PEPFAR has saved 25 million lives and contributed to a brighter future for those living with HIV/AIDS over the past 20 years.
