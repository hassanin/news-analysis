The Department of Education official announced that President Trump is signing an executive order to ensure that education decisions are made by those closest to students. The order aims to give more control to states and localities, allowing them to make educational decisions as required by law. The executive order directs Secretary DeVos to review and potentially modify or repeal regulations and guidance issued by the Department of Education. The review will be conducted by a regulatory review task force, which will assess whether the regulations are consistent with federal law. The process will take 300 days, and a public report will be issued at the end. The executive order focuses on K-12 education and does not include pre-K or higher education. The order empowers the Secretary of Education to modify regulations that are inconsistent with federal law.
