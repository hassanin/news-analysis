The article argues that President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration is constitutional and a proper use of executive power. The authors state that the crisis at the southern border can only be solved by the federal government and since Congress has not provided any solutions, the president is executing his duties by invoking the National Emergencies Act. They explain that the act grants the president broad authority to determine what constitutes a national emergency and that President Trump has followed the proper procedures by notifying Congress. The authors also highlight that unlike previous presidents who unlawfully used executive power, President Trump is using it lawfully to address a crisis exacerbated by congressional inaction. They conclude by stating that the president has acted within the scope of his authority and that Congress should support him.
