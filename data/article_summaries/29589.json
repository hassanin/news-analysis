According to the Council of Economic Advisers, the strong economic performance in 2017 and 2018 was a distinct break from previous trends and exceeded expectations. The advance estimate of real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2019 also suggests that the economy continues to outperform expectations. The Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Open Market Committee had projected lower GDP growth for 2017, 2018, and 2019 compared to the actual growth rates. The estimate for the first quarter of 2019 may underestimate the current pace of economic growth due to historical trends of lower growth in the first quarter and the impact of the partial government shutdown. Without these factors, real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2019 could have been up to 1.2 percentage points higher, implying an annualized growth rate of 4.4 percent.
