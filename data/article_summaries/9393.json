The Department of Labor is proposing a new rule to enhance safety standards for emergency responders, including equipment, training, and vehicle operations. This is the first update in over 40 years and aims to prevent injuries for the more than one million emergency responders in the US. The administration is committed to supporting these brave individuals and providing them with the necessary resources for their jobs.
