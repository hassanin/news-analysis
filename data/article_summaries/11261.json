On April 13, 2010, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order blocking the property of certain individuals contributing to the conflict in Somalia. The order was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the National Emergencies Act (NEA). The United Nations Security Council had expressed concern about the violence and piracy in Somalia and called on member states to take action. The order declares a national emergency to address the threat to national security and foreign policy posed by the conflict in Somalia. It targets individuals who threaten peace and stability in Somalia, obstruct the delivery of humanitarian assistance, or violate the arms embargo. The order blocks their property and interests in the United States or in the possession or control of US persons. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, has the authority to designate additional persons for blocking. The order also authorizes the promulgation of rules and regulations and directs all executive agencies to take appropriate measures to carry out its provisions. The order became effective on April 13, 2010.
