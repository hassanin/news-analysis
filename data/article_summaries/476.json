In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reaffirms America's commitment to the ideals of freedom, democracy, equality, liberty, and justice for all. He acknowledges that while the country has not fully lived up to these ideals, it has never abandoned them either. The United States believes in supporting people around the world who live under oppressive regimes and aims to demonstrate how representative governance benefits everyone. The article highlights the importance of defending democracy, particularly in light of alarming trends such as autocratic nations invading neighboring territories, digital surveillance, human rights abuses, and transnational repression. Repressive regimes are not only subjugating their own citizens but also reaching across borders to threaten and harm human rights defenders, journalists, and civilians in other nations. This behavior undermines the rules-based international order. The United States is leading global efforts to counter authoritarianism, defend democracy, protect human rights, and promote peace, security, and prosperity. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine is condemned, and the valor and sacrifice of the Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom and democracy are honored. During Captive Nations Week, the United States stands in solidarity with human rights and pro-democracy advocates worldwide, reaffirming its commitment to amplifying their voices and ensuring their protection. The article concludes by calling on all Americans to champion justice, dignity, and freedom for all and designating July 17 through July 23, 2022, as Captive Nations Week.
