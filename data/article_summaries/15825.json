In this statement, President Obama discusses the state of the American auto industry when he took office and the steps his administration took to prevent its collapse. He mentions that GM and Chrysler were on the verge of failure, which would have had a negative impact on suppliers, distributors, and communities. The president states that he refused to let this happen and decided to rescue and retool the companies with taxpayer dollars. In 2011, Chrysler repaid all the money it owed to the American taxpayers, and now, the remaining shares of the government's investment in General Motors are being sold. The president highlights that each of the Big Three automakers is now strong enough to stand on its own and has become profitable for the first time in nearly a decade. The industry has also added more than 372,000 new jobs. President Obama praises the workers' ingenuity and resilience and states that the American auto industry is back. He acknowledges that the road to recovery has been long and difficult but emphasizes that the administration will continue working to restore opportunity and growth for all Americans.
