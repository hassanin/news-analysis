The President of the United States has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate stating that the national emergency with respect to the Central African Republic, which was declared in Executive Order 13667 on May 12, 2014, will continue beyond May 12, 2017. The letter explains that the situation in the Central African Republic, characterized by a breakdown of law and order, sectarian tension, widespread violence and atrocities, and the forced use of child soldiers, poses a threat to the peace, security, and stability of the country and its neighboring states, as well as to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
