Vice President Joe Biden, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, and IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman announced that average tax refunds are up nearly 10 percent this year, largely due to the tax benefits provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act). The White House launched a new interactive Tax Savings Tool to help taxpayers understand and take advantage of these tax credits. The Recovery Act provides several tax benefits, including the Making Work Pay tax credit, up to $2,500 in college expenses, up to $8,000 for the purchase of a first home, up to $1,500 in energy efficiency incentives, and the deduction of state and local sales taxes for new vehicle purchases. These tax benefits aim to put more money back into the pockets of middle-class families and stimulate the economy. The average tax refund for 2010 is $3,036, a $266 increase from the previous year. However, less than half of the expected tax returns have been filed so far, and the Obama Administration is making efforts to ensure that taxpayers are aware of the benefits they are eligible for this year. There will be a series of events held across the country to educate taxpayers on the Recovery Act benefits. The article also provides examples of how different families can benefit from the Recovery Act tax cuts.
