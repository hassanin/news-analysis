The article discusses the controversy surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Democrats have accused Kavanaugh of misleading the Senate regarding his involvement in the nomination of Judge Charles Pickering. The New York Times published emails that suggest Kavanaugh's involvement was minimal, but the article argues that Kavanaugh's work on the nomination was that of a minor player. The article also notes that the Times did not reach out to Judge Pickering for comment. The author concludes that Kavanaugh is highly qualified and that the Democrats have missed the mark with their accusations.
