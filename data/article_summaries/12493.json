The article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2012 to support the safe and responsible development of unconventional domestic natural gas resources. The order aims to coordinate the efforts of federal agencies responsible for overseeing natural gas development and infrastructure. It also seeks to reduce the country's dependence on oil by promoting the use of natural gas, which is a cleaner source of energy. The order establishes an interagency working group to facilitate coordinated policy efforts for safe and responsible development. The working group includes representatives from various government departments and agencies. The order emphasizes the importance of protecting natural and cultural resources, air and water quality, and public health and safety during natural gas development. It also recognizes that while natural gas production is carried out by private firms, the federal government has a role to play in regulating activities on public and Indian trust lands and setting health and environmental standards. The order is implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to available appropriations.
