In this statement, the President congratulates the people of Libya on their historic declaration of liberation after four decades of dictatorship and eight months of conflict. Now that the fighting has ended, the Transitional National Council (TNC) must focus on the political transition. The United States looks forward to working with the TNC and an empowered transitional government as they prepare for free and fair elections. The Libyan authorities are urged to respect human rights, initiate a national reconciliation process, secure weapons, and bring armed groups under civilian leadership. The United States will continue to cooperate with international partners and the UN Support Mission in Libya to support a stable and democratic transition.
