The White House announced new national standards for fuel efficiency and emissions for vehicles. The standards require an average fuel economy of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016, reducing oil consumption by 1.8 billion barrels and preventing greenhouse gas emissions by 950 million metric tons. This proposal emerged from a coalition of diverse groups and aims to protect health, the environment, and move towards a sustainable, energy-efficient economy. Automakers will be able to build a single national fleet that satisfies requirements under federal programs and the standards of California and other states. Consumers will save over $3,000 in fuel costs and the standards will conserve 1.8 billion barrels of oil, reducing dependence on foreign fuel. The program is designed to ensure a cleaner, more sustainable transportation sector for America. The Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency worked together to develop these standards.
