Vice President Joe Biden released a statement expressing his sadness over the passing of Nuala Pell, a close friend of his and his wife Jill. Nuala and her husband, Senator Clairborne Pell, were supportive of Biden during his early days in the Senate after he had lost his wife and daughter. The Pells provided him with a welcoming home in Washington. Biden also spoke about the love and partnership that marked Nuala and Clairborne's marriage. They worked together on various issues such as elderly care, women's health, arts and humanities, and access to education. After Clairborne's passing, Nuala continued her lifetime of service by creating the Nuala Pell Leadership Program in Public Service, which aims to equip future leaders with the skills needed to enter public service. Biden believes that Nuala's legacy will live on through the next generation of leaders she helped nurture and in the hearts of her many friends.
