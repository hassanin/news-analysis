In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims October 11, 2012, as General Pulaski Memorial Day. He highlights the contributions and sacrifices of Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski, a Polish-born patriot who fought for American independence. Pulaski, who was known as the "Father of the American Cavalry," fought alongside men from Europe and America to extend the principles of liberty, equality, and justice. Despite not living to see the success of the revolution, Pulaski's legacy lives on, and Polish Americans continue to contribute to the growth and progress of the United States. President Obama encourages Americans to commemorate this day and honor Pulaski's heroism and the dedication of those who defend the freedom of the nation.
