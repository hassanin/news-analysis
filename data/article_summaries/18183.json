The article is a transcript of a press gaggle by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney aboard Air Force One en route to Cincinnati, Ohio. Carney discusses the President's visit to the Brent Spence Bridge, which is in need of repair and symbolic of the overall crumbling infrastructure in the United States. The President is calling on Congress to pass the American Jobs Act to put Americans back to work and upgrade the country's infrastructure. Carney also addresses questions about the New York Police Department's surveillance of Muslim communities, Iran's criticism of U.S. policy, the vote in the House on the CR, and the pace at which the Senate has taken up the American Jobs Act.
