In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims October 2015 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. He emphasizes that domestic violence affects people of all ages, backgrounds, and beliefs. He states that nearly 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men in the United States have experienced severe physical violence from an intimate partner. The President highlights that domestic violence not only causes physical harm but also leads to financial insecurity and lifelong trauma for children who witness it. He acknowledges the progress made through legislation such as the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, which have enhanced the criminal justice response and provided support for survivors. The President also highlights his administration's efforts to extend protections to more victims, including those in Native American and immigrant communities, and to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and identity in providing services. He mentions that the Affordable Care Act now covers preventive services for domestic violence at no additional cost. The President emphasizes that despite the progress made, more work needs to be done to raise awareness and provide assistance to those affected by domestic violence. He highlights initiatives such as the 1is2many campaign and the White House Conference on Aging, which address dating violence, sexual assault, and elder abuse. The President encourages people in need to seek assistance from the National Domestic Violence Hotline and calls on all Americans to speak out against domestic violence and support local efforts to assist victims.
