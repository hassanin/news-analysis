In a press briefing, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar outlined the Trump administration's blueprint for driving down prescription drug prices. Azar highlighted four major problems with the current system: high list prices for drugs, government rules that hinder good deals for seniors, foreign countries freeriding off American innovation, and high out-of-pocket costs. The blueprint includes strategies to increase competition, improve negotiation, lower list prices, and reduce out-of-pocket costs. Azar emphasized that the plan would take time to implement and would require restructuring the complex system. He also stated that most of the actions could be accomplished through executive action, although some may require legislative action.
