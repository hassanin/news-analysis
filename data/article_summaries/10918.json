On May 22, 2015, the President signed several bills into law. H.R. 606, known as the "Don't Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act," excludes certain compensation from gross income for federal income tax purposes. This applies to compensation received by public safety officers who have died or become permanently and totally disabled as a result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty. 

H.R. 651 designates the United States Postal Service facility located at 820 Elmwood Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island, as the Sister Ann Keefe Post Office. 

H.R. 1075 designates the United States Customs and Border Protection Port of Entry located at First Street and Pan American Avenue in Douglas, Arizona, as the Raul Hector Castro Port of Entry. 

H.R. 1191, also known as the "Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015," amends the Atomic Energy Act to provide for congressional review and oversight of a potential comprehensive nuclear deal with Iran. 

Lastly, S. 1124, the "WIOA Technical Amendments Act," makes technical corrections to several drafting errors in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, ensuring that the law applies as intended.
