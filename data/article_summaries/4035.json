President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Louisiana and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following Hurricane Ida. The declaration makes federal funding available to individuals, businesses, and local governments in several affected parishes. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. Federal funding is also available for debris removal and emergency protective measures. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are eligible for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. John E. Long has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and more parishes and types of assistance may be designated in the future. Residents and business owners in the designated parishes can apply for assistance starting tomorrow through the Disaster Assistance website or by phone. The FEMA News Desk can be contacted for further information.
