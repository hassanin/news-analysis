President Trump held a meeting with state, local, and tribal leaders to discuss the potential for unlocking energy reserves on Native American lands and in various states. Trump expressed his commitment to lifting restrictions and regulations that have hindered access to these energy resources, stating that it is unfair to Native Americans and denying them the benefits of their own lands. He also mentioned the progress being made in healthcare reform, expressing confidence in a plan that would be a "fantastic tribute" to the country and provide better care at a lower cost. Trump emphasized the importance of working with Republican senators to achieve the approval of the healthcare plan.
