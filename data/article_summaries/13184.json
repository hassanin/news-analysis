President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House and the President stating his intention to continue the national emergency with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process. This national emergency was declared on January 23, 1995, and is set to expire on January 23, 2016. The President believes that the crisis with respect to these terrorists has not been resolved, as they continue to engage in activities that threaten the peace process in the Middle East and are hostile to US interests in the region. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency and the sanctions against these terrorists in order to respond to this ongoing threat.
