The article discusses the benefits of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) for the state of Illinois, particularly for its agriculture and manufacturing sectors. The Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, highlights how the USMCA will open up new markets for agricultural products and ensure that manufacturing jobs stay in America. Illinois exports over $27 billion worth of goods to Mexico and Canada, with machinery being the state's top export. Companies like John Deere and Caterpillar, which are leaders in farming and construction equipment manufacturing respectively, will benefit from increased exports to North American neighbors. The USMCA also includes a new labor value content rule to drive higher wages for manufacturing jobs, benefiting blue-collar workers in Illinois. Additionally, the agreement maintains Illinois' duty-free access to Mexico's hog market, which is the state's largest meat export. Overall, the article emphasizes that the USMCA will support economic growth, expand market access, and benefit farmers, ranchers, and workers in Illinois.
