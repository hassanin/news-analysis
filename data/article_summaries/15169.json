President Obama has proposed a plan for early education for all Americans, emphasizing the importance of investing in high-quality early learning programs. The plan includes providing high-quality preschool for every child, growing the supply of effective early learning opportunities for young children, and extending and expanding evidence-based, voluntary home visiting programs. The President's proposal aims to close the school readiness gap and ensure that children have the chance to enter kindergarten ready for success. The plan also includes expanding access to high-quality public preschool through a federal-state partnership, improving quality and expanding access to preschool through federal funding, and encouraging states to expand the availability of full-day kindergarten. The President will also launch a new Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership program to support states and communities in expanding the availability of early learning settings for infants and toddlers. Additionally, the plan includes expanding the administration's evidence-based home visiting initiative to provide support for at-risk families. The President's commitment to early education is built upon previous initiatives, such as Race to the Top - Early Learning Challenge, Head Start and Early Head Start programs, and supporting the federal child care system.
