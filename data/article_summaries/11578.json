In this letter, President Barack Obama announces an alternative plan for pay increases for federal civilian employees in January 2017. He states that due to "national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare," he has determined that across-the-board pay increases will be 1.0 percent for 2017. He also mentions that a decision will be made by November 30, 2016, regarding an alternative plan for locality payments. The total combined cost of the base pay increase and locality pay increases will be limited to 1.6 percent of basic payroll. The adjustments will take effect on the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The President assures that these decisions will not significantly impact the ability to attract and retain a well-qualified Federal workforce.
