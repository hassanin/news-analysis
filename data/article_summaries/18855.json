President Obama has declared a major disaster in West Virginia due to severe storms, flooding, mudslides, and landslides that occurred starting on March 12, 2010. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Affected individuals in certain counties can receive grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help with recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide can also receive federal funding. Terry L. Quarles has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance through DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling FEMA. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.
