The White House has announced new rules proposed by the U.S. Department of Labor to provide minimum wage and overtime protections for nearly two million workers who provide in-home care services for the elderly and infirmed. These workers, who provide critical health care services, deserve the protections provided under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This is part of a series of executive actions taken by the Obama Administration to strengthen the economy. The proposed regulation would ensure that home care workers employed by third parties, like staffing agencies, receive protections, and that those performing skilled in-home care work are covered. However, those engaged in tasks related to fellowship and protection would still be considered 'companions' and not subject to wage protections. This issue gained national attention when the Supreme Court ruled that a home care worker was not entitled to overtime pay, leading to the proposed regulations. Currently, states vary in whether they extend minimum wage and overtime provisions to home health care workers. The proposed rule would provide home care workers in states without these protections with new protections. The Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division is responsible for enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act, and interested parties can submit comments on the proposed rule.
