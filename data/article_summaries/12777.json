The President met with House Ways and Means Committee Democrats to discuss health reform legislation. They agreed that the legislation should lower costs, expand coverage, and not add to the deficit. The President mentioned plans to announce additional savings for Medicare and Medicaid. He also expressed support for a revenue-raising proposal that would restore the itemized deduction rate for the wealthiest Americans to the level during Ronald Reagan's presidency. The meeting also covered important components of health care reform, including primary care, prevention, and wellness. They agreed to aim for final passage of the bill in October.
