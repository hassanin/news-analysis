Vice President Biden kicked off his "Road to Recovery" tour in Pennsylvania, where he attended the groundbreaking for the Route 34 bridge project. The tour aims to highlight the impact of Recovery Act funds in creating jobs and improving infrastructure. The Vice President previously visited the bridge in February, and since then, a $1.7 million contract has been awarded to replace the 80-year-old bridge. Pennsylvania Governor Edward G. Rendell and Senator Arlen Specter were also present at the event. The Vice President emphasized that these projects are not only creating immediate employment but also investing in the economic future. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood stated that transportation projects funded by the Recovery Act are making a difference in communities across the country. Governor Rendell highlighted the efficient use of Recovery dollars in rebuilding the state's economy and employing workers who had been laid off. Senator Specter emphasized the importance of repairing bridges for the safety of Pennsylvanians. As of June 11, 2009, over $135 billion in Recovery Act funds have been obligated to programs and projects, creating or saving over 150,000 jobs.
