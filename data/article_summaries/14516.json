This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2015 to create a National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI). The purpose of the initiative is to maximize the benefits of high-performance computing (HPC) research, development, and deployment for economic competitiveness and scientific discovery. The order establishes the NSCI as a whole-of-government effort, executed in collaboration with industry and academia, to create a cohesive, multi-agency strategic vision and investment strategy for HPC. The order identifies five strategic objectives for the NSCI, including accelerating the development of an exascale computing system, increasing coherence between modeling/simulation and data analytics, and developing a comprehensive approach to transition HPC research into operations. The order also establishes lead agencies, foundational research and development agencies, and deployment agencies to carry out the objectives of the NSCI. An NSCI Executive Council is established to coordinate and oversee the implementation of the initiative. The council is co-chaired by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The executive council will meet regularly to assess the progress of the NSCI and may seek advice from other agencies and private sector groups. The order also requires the executive council to establish an implementation plan and prepare annual reports on the status of the NSCI for the President. The order clarifies definitions of terms related to high-performance computing and specifies that it does not impair existing authorities or create new rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States.
