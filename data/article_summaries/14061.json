President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Arkansas and has ordered Federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from May 24-26, 2011. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in Franklin and Johnson Counties. This assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available to State and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for cost-sharing funding. Nancy M. Casper has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week until further notice. For more information, contact FEMA.
