President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Oregon and has ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts after a severe winter storm, flooding, landslides, and mudslides occurred in January 2012. The declaration allows federal funding to be provided to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide can also receive federal funding. Dolph A. Diemont has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
