First Lady Michelle Obama will be delivering commencement addresses at Tuskegee University, Oberlin College, and King College Prep as part of her Reach Higher initiative. These institutions were chosen because they are working towards the goal of increasing the proportion of college graduates in America. Tuskegee University was selected because of its legacy as a historically black university. Oberlin College and King College Prep were chosen based on their outstanding video submissions to two challenges issued by the First Lady: the "Near-Peer" Mentoring College Challenge and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Completion Challenge. The First Lady's Office received nearly 200 video submissions from schools across the country. The commencement addresses will take place on May 9, May 25, and June 9.
