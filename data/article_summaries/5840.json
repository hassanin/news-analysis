The article discusses the pressures that economies around the world are facing as they emerge from the global pandemic, particularly in terms of rising prices. However, recent developments show that price and cost increases are slowing, although not as quickly as desired. Half of the price increases mentioned in the report are related to cars and energy costs from November. Since then, there have been significant reductions in energy prices, with gas prices nationally decreasing from their peak and prices in 20 states already below their 20-year average. The price of natural gas is also down 25% from its November average. In the car market, there has been a recent decline in used car prices on the wholesale market, which is expected to translate into lower prices for Americans in the coming months.

Despite these positive developments, price increases continue to put pressure on family budgets. Efforts are being made to address supply chain challenges that have made it more expensive to get goods on shelves, and progress is expected in the weeks ahead. The article emphasizes the importance of passing the Build Back Better plan in Congress to provide relief to American families by lowering the costs of health care, prescription drugs, child care, and more. The plan is projected to save a typical family of four $7,400 every year and ease long-term inflationary pressures on the economy.

The article also highlights the devastation that the pandemic has caused to the economy but notes that the jobs recovery is on track, with unemployment insurance claims falling to their lowest level in 50 years and nearly 6 million Americans back to work. Economic growth in the United States is stronger than in most other nations, and Americans have more money in their pockets compared to the same time last year, even after accounting for price increases. However, it is crucial to bring down prices and costs for consumers to feel confident in the recovery. This is a top goal of the administration.
