President Biden is meeting with G7 leaders to discuss creating a fair and sustainable global economy. They are committed to supporting a global recovery that benefits middle-class and working families. One of the key agreements reached is endorsing a strong global minimum tax of at least 15%, which aims to end the race to the bottom in corporate tax rates. This will ensure multinational corporations pay their fair share and provide resources for domestic priorities such as infrastructure and education. The G7 also agreed to replace discriminatory taxes with a broader reallocation of taxing rights to profitable multinational corporations. Additionally, there are discussions about reallocating Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to countries in need, which would support health needs and promote a more balanced and inclusive global recovery.
