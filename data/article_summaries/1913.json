President Joe Biden has declared a state of emergency in Tennessee and authorized federal assistance to supplement the state and local response efforts following severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes that occurred from December 10 to December 11, 2021. The declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts aimed at helping the affected population and providing necessary emergency measures to save lives, protect property, and ensure public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to identify and mobilize equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency, with emergency protective measures and direct federal assistance funded at 75 percent by the federal government. Myra M. Shird has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
