This article discusses the importance of investing in the youth population in Africa. It highlights the fact that Africa has the youngest population in the world, with a projected increase from 200 million to 330 million people between the ages of 15 and 24 by 2034. The article emphasizes the need for leadership, skills, and innovation from the youth in order for African nations to succeed in the future. 

The United States is committed to investing in the next generation of African leaders through the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI), which includes the development of Regional Leadership Centers, online classes, and resources, as well as funding and networking opportunities for young entrepreneurs. The flagship program of YALI has been renamed the Mandela Washington Fellowship in honor of Nelson Mandela and is set to reach 1,000 young leaders each year by 2016.

Various African governments have also made commitments to invest in their youth populations. Examples include Benin's support for young farmers and efforts to address youth unemployment, Burkina Faso's youth investment project, Burundi's Youth Employment Agency and initiatives to support young entrepreneurs, Cabo Verde's expansion of youth centers, and the Republic of Congo's youth volunteer and civil service program. Other countries such as Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea, Senegal, Seychelles, Somalia, and Tanzania have also made efforts to empower and support their youth populations through various programs and initiatives.
