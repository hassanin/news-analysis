The United States strongly condemns the attack on the National Theater in Mogadishu, Somalia, expressing condolences to the Somali people affected by the tragic loss of life. The statement highlights Somalia's progress in improving security and rebuilding the city with the support of African Union peacekeepers. The attack by Al-Shabaab on the newly reopened theater is seen as an obstacle to Somalia's path to peace and stability, indicating the group's rejection by the Somali people. The US remains committed to assisting Somalia in countering Al-Shabaab's violence and restoring peace to the country.
