President Obama signed an Executive Order to improve partnerships between the government and faith-based and neighborhood organizations. The changes were recommended by a taskforce of the President's Advisory Council on Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships and aim to strengthen the legal footing of these partnerships and provide support to these organizations. The Executive Order requires the government to protect beneficiaries of federally funded social service programs, clarifies that financial awards must be free from political interference, and allows faith-based organizations to use their facilities and retain religious characteristics. It also establishes an interagency working group to ensure consistency in regulations and guidance documents.
