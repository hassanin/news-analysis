Brett McGurk, the Deputy Assistant to the President and Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, is embarking on a trip to several countries in the region. In Belgium, he will brief NATO Allies and European Union partners on a coordinated approach to the current situation in the Middle East, with a focus on providing more humanitarian assistance to Gaza, putting economic pressure on Hamas and other terrorist groups, and securing the release of hostages held by Hamas. In Israel, he will discuss Israel's security needs, the protection of civilians during military operations, efforts to secure the release of hostages, and the need to address violent extremist settlers in the West Bank. In the West Bank, McGurk will express the Biden Administration's support for the Palestinian Authority and the importance of reforms for long-term stability in both the West Bank and Gaza. He will also emphasize the aspirations of Palestinians for freedom, security, and dignity in their own state. In the Gulf region, McGurk will discuss containing the conflict with Hamas and deterring any group or state seeking to expand it, as well as providing U.S. security assistance to Gulf Cooperation Council partners. In Doha, he will focus on efforts to secure the release of hostages, including Americans, being held by Hamas. Lastly, in Jordan, McGurk will consult with senior leaders on the Biden Administration's support for Jordan and a viable pathway to a Palestinian state. He will be accompanied by Assistant Secretary for Near East Affairs, Ambassador Barbara Leaf.
