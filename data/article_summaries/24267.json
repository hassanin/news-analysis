In this article, President Barack Obama announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Burma. He explains that Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act allows for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless the President publishes a notice stating that it will continue. The crisis between the United States and Burma, caused by the actions and policies of the Burmese government, including the repression of the democratic opposition, has not been resolved. These actions and policies are seen as a threat to U.S. interests and national security. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency and the sanctions against Burma in response to this threat.
