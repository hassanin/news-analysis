In a statement issued on October 27, 2019, President Trump announced that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, had been brought to justice and is dead. The United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years, considering him a top national security priority. A dangerous nighttime raid was conducted in Northwestern Syria by U.S. Special Operations forces to accomplish this mission. No U.S. personnel were lost in the operation, but a large number of Baghdadi's fighters and companions were killed. Baghdadi died after running into a dead-end tunnel and ignited his vest, killing himself and three children he had dragged with him. The compound was cleared, and eleven young children were moved out unharmed. The mission took approximately 2 hours, and sensitive material and information were taken from the raid. President Trump emphasized that Baghdadi's demise shows America's commitment to relentlessly pursue terrorist leaders and completely defeat ISIS. The President also thanked Russia, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and the Syrian Kurds for their support in the mission. The statement concludes with President Trump expressing gratitude to the intelligence professionals, military personnel, and other agencies involved in the successful operation. He states that Baghdadi's death makes the world a safer place and ends with "God bless the United States of America!"
