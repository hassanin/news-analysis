In recognition of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, President Joe Biden emphasizes the importance of addressing elder abuse and protecting the rights of older Americans. Elder abuse can take various forms, including financial, emotional, physical, sexual abuse, exploitation, and neglect. Unfortunately, many cases go unreported. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the issue due to increased social isolation among seniors. However, with the majority of Americans aged 65 and older now fully vaccinated, there is hope for a brighter future. The American Rescue Plan includes funding to promote community living and ensure the safety of older adults. The plan also enhances the Elder Justice Act and provides Medicaid funding for home and community-based healthcare services. The American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan will further support the care infrastructure for older Americans. President Biden instructs federal agencies to combat elder abuse and hate in all forms. The administration is working to renew and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act, which addresses abuse and neglect in later life. Federal funding has also been provided to Adult Protective Services programs in each state to investigate abuse and assist victims. On this day, caregivers and professionals who work to prevent elder abuse are acknowledged and celebrated. President Biden calls upon all Americans to create inclusive communities, learn the warning signs of elder abuse, and challenge age-related biases. The proclamation designates June 15, 2021, as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day.
