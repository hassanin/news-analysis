President Barack Obama has proclaimed March 2, 2011, as Read Across America Day. This day is dedicated to promoting the importance of reading and literacy in the lives of children. The proclamation emphasizes that reading is the foundation for all other learning and encourages parents, mentors, and educators to instill a love for reading in young people. The proclamation also recognizes the role of teachers in preparing students for the challenges of the future and highlights the importance of reading in subjects such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The day coincides with the birthday of Dr. Seuss, whose stories have helped generations of children enjoy reading and develop basic reading skills. The proclamation calls upon children, families, educators, librarians, and public officials to observe Read Across America Day with appropriate programs and activities.
