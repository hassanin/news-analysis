In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims June 15th as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. He highlights the importance of raising awareness about elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, which is often under-identified and under-reported. Elder abuse can take various forms, including physical, emotional, sexual abuse, neglect, abandonment, and financial exploitation. The President emphasizes the need for all Americans to recognize and report mistreatment and to ensure that older citizens receive the support and protection they deserve. He mentions initiatives such as the Elder Justice Act and rules requiring financial advisors to prioritize their clients' interests. The Federal Government, along with non-profit and private sector leaders, is working to provide education, outreach, and resources for older Americans. The President also mentions the upcoming White House Conference on Aging, which aims to address issues related to healthy aging, long-term services and support, retirement security, and protecting older Americans from abuse. He concludes by calling on all Americans to observe this day and learn about the signs of elder abuse while raising awareness about this important public health issue.
