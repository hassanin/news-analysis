The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order, signed by President Obama, aims to crack down on federal contractors who violate labor laws and put workers at risk. The order requires prospective federal contractors to disclose labor law violations and gives agencies guidance on considering these violations when awarding contracts. It also encourages companies to settle disputes and ensures workers receive accurate pay information. The order holds corporations accountable by requiring them to disclose labor law violations before receiving contracts and cracks down on repeat violators. It aims to promote efficient federal contracting by preventing contracts from being awarded to companies with a history of labor law violations. The order also protects responsible contractors who have clean records and focuses on helping companies improve compliance with workplace protections. It prohibits companies with federal contracts of $1 million or more from requiring employees to enter into arbitration agreements for certain disputes. The order requires contractors to provide employees with information about their paychecks and streamlines reporting requirements for contractors. Overall, the order aims to ensure fair pay and safe workplaces for all workers and increase efficiency in federal contracting.
