The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the United States Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) have held a counternarcotics dialogue with the Government of Colombia to develop a joint action plan. The plan aims to reduce coca cultivation and cocaine production by 50 percent by the end of 2023. The dialogue focused on increasing eradication and interdiction efforts, improving security and economic opportunities in affected rural areas, and targeting money laundering and illicit finances related to narcotics. The ONDCP also released the 2019 estimate for coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia, which showed stable coca cultivation at 212,000 hectares and a slight increase in potential pure cocaine production. The Colombian government's efforts in eradication have shown positive results, and security forces have made significant seizures of cocaine and coca base. The aim of these efforts is to reduce the supply of drugs and save lives, as drug use and overdose deaths involving cocaine have increased in the United States. In Fiscal Year 2019, the United States and partner nations seized or disrupted over 280 metric tons of cocaine destined for the United States.
