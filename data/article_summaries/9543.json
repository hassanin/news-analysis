President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Oklahoma and ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding occurred from May 5-10, 2015. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Cleveland, Grady, and Oklahoma. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. John Long has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone.
