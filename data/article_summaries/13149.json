President Obama is calling on Congress to fully fund the Administration's budget request to improve security at U.S. embassies around the world. He is also urging Congress to support the full implementation of the recommendations of the Benghazi Accountability Review Board (ARB), which includes additional support, authorities, and resources for the State Department. The President is also asking for support to enhance Marine Security Guard detachments at high-risk posts. The Department of State has already taken steps to address security vulnerabilities, including reallocating $1.4 billion in FY 2013 resources. The FY 2014 budget request provides over $4 billion for embassy security programs, including $2.2 billion for increased embassy security construction recommended by the Benghazi ARB. The budget also includes resources for increased security training and a 5% increase in diplomatic security staff. The Department of State also needs authority to address immediate security concerns, including the ability to transfer resources from other State Department operating accounts. The President will continue to work towards preventing future tragedies and urges members of Congress to work together on behalf of the American people.
