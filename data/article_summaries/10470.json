President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 2016 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month in the United States. Ovarian cancer is a serious and deadly disease that affects women of all ages and backgrounds. Although the incidence and death rate of ovarian cancer have fallen in recent years, it still causes more deaths than any other female reproductive system cancer. The lack of effective screening tests and early warning signs often results in cases being caught at an advanced stage, making it more difficult to treat. It is estimated that over 22,000 American women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year. Therefore, it is important for all women to consult with their healthcare providers if they experience symptoms such as pressure, swelling, and abdominal pain. The Affordable Care Act has eliminated annual and lifetime limits on insurance coverage, expanded preventive services like well-woman visits, and prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions or family history of cancer. Earlier this year, President Obama announced a new national effort to cure cancer, led by Vice President Joe Biden. The White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force aims to promote research efforts and eliminate cancer by identifying new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat it. The Department of Defense Ovarian Cancer Research Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also been actively involved in fighting ovarian cancer. The proclamation calls upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, healthcare providers, and research institutions to raise awareness about ovarian cancer and contribute to improving the lives of those affected by the disease.
