The article discusses a meeting between the President and a bipartisan group of Senators to discuss the need for passing comprehensive energy and climate legislation. The President emphasized the importance of transitioning to clean energy and stated that it would require a national effort. He suggested that a bill should be passed to make clean energy profitable for businesses by putting a price on pollution. However, not all Senators agreed with this approach, and the President welcomed other ideas to reduce oil dependence, create jobs, strengthen national security, and reduce pollution. Despite differing opinions, there was consensus on the urgency of taking action, and the President expressed confidence in getting something done this year.
