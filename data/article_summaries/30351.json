The article discusses President Donald J. Trump's call for immigration reforms to address issues with chain migration and the visa lottery system. It argues that the current immigration system, which prioritizes family ties over merit, poses risks to national security and does not meet the needs of the modern United States economy. The article cites a joint report from the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, which found that a significant number of individuals convicted of international terrorism-related charges since September 11, 2001, entered the country through family ties and extended-family chain migration. Additionally, it highlights concerns about the diversity visa lottery program, which randomly selects foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence in the US without requiring special skills or much education. The article states that this program invites fraud and does not serve the national interest, citing warnings from the State Department's Deputy Inspector General about threats to national security and instances of sophisticated fraud perpetrated by organized fraud rings. It also mentions that the US has issued thousands of immigrant visas through the visa lottery program to nationals from countries designated as "State Sponsors of Terrorism," raising further concerns. The article concludes by listing examples of terrorists and criminals who entered the US through chain migration or the visa lottery program.
