The Biden-Harris Administration has announced that it is allocating over $40 billion to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories to deploy affordable, reliable high-speed internet service to American families through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. This investment is the largest single investment in high-speed internet in history and the largest one-time announcement from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Every state will receive more than $100 million in BEAD allocations, with 19 states receiving more than a billion dollars. Bipartisan public officials and industry leaders from all 50 states, D.C., and territories have praised the announcement. The funding will be used to expand broadband infrastructure, close the digital divide, and ensure that all Americans have access to reliable, affordable high-speed internet.
