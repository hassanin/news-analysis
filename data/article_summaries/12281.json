President Obama has signed into law the "Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010," which strengthens the Coast Guard as a military service and branch of the Armed Forces. The Act provides organizational flexibility for the Coast Guard and improves its military housing. It also enhances the marine safety and maritime security missions of the Coast Guard and implements the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, 2001. However, there are some provisions in the Act that the President has concerns about. Section 818 requires the Comptroller General to determine the feasibility of delivering a transportation security card to an approved applicant's place of residence. The President believes this provision gives the Comptroller General authority to bind the Secretary of Homeland Security, which is an executive function, so the Secretary will treat the Comptroller General's findings as advisory and nonbinding. Additionally, certain provisions in section 401 may grant significant authority to the Coast Guard Chief Acquisition Officer, who is not appointed in accordance with the Constitution's Appointments Clause. Therefore, the President will interpret these provisions as requiring approval from a supervisor who is an officer of the United States before exercising significant authority.
