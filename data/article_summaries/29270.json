President Donald Trump has issued a Presidential Memorandum titled "The Effect of Uranium Imports on the National Security and Establishment of the United States Nuclear Fuel Working Group." The memorandum addresses concerns about the impact of uranium imports on the national security of the United States. The Secretary of Commerce conducted an investigation and found that uranium imports threaten to impair national security. However, the President does not concur with this finding and believes a fuller analysis of national security considerations is necessary. Therefore, the President has established the United States Nuclear Fuel Working Group to develop recommendations for reviving and expanding domestic nuclear fuel production. The working group will include various government officials and will examine the current state of domestic nuclear fuel production. Within 90 days, the working group will submit a report to the President with their findings and recommendations. The memorandum also includes general provisions to ensure compliance with applicable law and international agreements.
