The White House is concerned about the ongoing conflict in South Sudan and the actions of the government and rebel forces. The violence has resulted in thousands of deaths and the displacement of nearly one million civilians. The United States is committed to supporting peace and stability in South Sudan and will not tolerate those who threaten it. President Obama has signed an Executive Order that allows for sanctions against individuals who obstruct the peace process, target UN peacekeepers, or commit human rights abuses. The government and rebel forces are urged to engage in the inclusive peace process and end military actions. The people of South Sudan are calling for peace, and there is no room for excuses or delay.
