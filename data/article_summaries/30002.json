On May 30, 2018, the President signed into law the "Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017" (S. 204). This law allows certain patients to request access to unapproved investigational drugs directly from a drug sponsor or manufacturer. It also limits the use of clinical outcomes and liability related to the provision of these drugs and establishes reporting requirements for the use and outcomes of this new authority.
