The Biden-Harris Administration has announced $785 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan to support community-based organizations in building vaccine confidence, aid Tribal communities in mitigating the spread of the virus, respond to the needs of people with disabilities and older adults, and expand the public health workforce. This funding is in line with the recommendations of the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force. Over 80% of the Task Force's recommendations have already been fulfilled, and the Administration is committed to incorporating the remaining recommendations into future initiatives and programs.
