On January 28, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order entitled "Ethics Pledge" that outlines a set of obligations for appointees in executive agencies. The order requires every appointee in an executive agency appointed on or after January 20, 2017, to sign a pledge committing to certain ethical obligations. These obligations include refraining from engaging in lobbying activities with respect to the agency they are appointed to serve within five years after the termination of their employment, abiding by post-employment restrictions on communicating with employees of their former executive agency, and not engaging in lobbying activities with respect to any covered executive branch official or non-career Senior Executive Service appointee for the remainder of the Administration. The pledge also includes commitments to not engage in activities on behalf of foreign governments or political parties that would require registration under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, not accepting gifts from registered lobbyists or lobbying organizations, and not participating in any matter involving specific parties that is directly related to their former employer or clients. The order also defines various terms and provides mechanisms for enforcement, including the possibility of waivers and penalties for violations. The order supersedes a previous executive order on ethics commitments by executive branch personnel issued in 2009.
