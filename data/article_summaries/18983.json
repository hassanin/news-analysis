The article is a statement by the President on the signing of the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) and NATO Status of Forces Agreement in Afghanistan.

The NATO Status of Forces Agreement gives legal protections to Allied and partner countries' forces for the NATO Resolute Support mission. These agreements follow an historic Afghan election and reflect the commitment to support the new Afghan Unity Government.
