President Biden has announced the nomination of eight individuals to serve as U.S. Attorneys across the country. These nominees, who are historic firsts in many cases, were chosen for their dedication to enforcing the law, professionalism, experience, commitment to equal justice, and support for the independence of the Department of Justice. The President's comprehensive effort to address the increase in gun crime includes putting more police officers on the streets, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys as chief federal law enforcement officers in their districts is crucial for these efforts. The nominees include Erek L. Barron for the District of Maryland, Nicholas W. Brown for the Western District of Washington, Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia, Clifford D. Johnson for the Northern District of Indiana, Zachary A. Myers for the Southern District of Indiana, Rachael S. Rollins for the District of Massachusetts, Trini E. Ross for the Western District of New York, and Vanessa Waldref for the Eastern District of Washington.
