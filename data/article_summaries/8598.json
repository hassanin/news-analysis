The Biden-Harris Administration has announced its Improving Student Achievement Agenda for 2024, which aims to accelerate academic performance for every child in school. The agenda focuses on three evidence-based strategies: increasing student attendance, providing high-dosage tutoring, and increasing summer learning and extended or afterschool learning time. The administration believes that these strategies will help students recover from the effects of the pandemic and improve their academic progress. The article emphasizes the importance of reducing chronic absenteeism, implementing well-designed tutoring programs, and expanding summer and afterschool programs. The Department of Education will work with states to track progress, allocate resources, and support school improvement efforts. The administration has also made historic investments to reopen schools and support students during the pandemic. Several philanthropic and national organizations have announced commitments to support academic achievement, and the administration will continue to collaborate with them.
