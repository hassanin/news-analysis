During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One en route to Midway Atoll, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Senior Advisor Brian Deese discussed various topics. President Obama had telephoned FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate to discuss hurricane preparedness in Florida and Hawaii. The President also discussed the Marine Monument Papahānaumokuākea, which he was going to visit. Deese explained that the President's approach to conservation is grounded in science, seeks to elevate native voices in conservation management, and recognizes the connection between conservation and climate change. Deese also talked about the importance of the monument expansion in terms of climate resilience. The press also asked questions about the connection between climate change and conservation, the impact of the monument on fisheries, private contributions to protected areas, the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal, Russia's role in Syria, and the issue of tax avoidance by multinational corporations.
