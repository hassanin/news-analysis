First Lady Melania Trump has announced an exhibit called "Building the Movement: America's Youth Celebrate 100 Years of Women's Suffrage" to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment. The exhibit, launching in August, will showcase artwork by young Americans depicting the historic milestone of women gaining the right to vote. Students in grades 3-12 across the United States and its territories are encouraged to submit artwork representing the women's suffrage movement. One artwork will be selected from each state and territory to be included in the exhibit, which will feature images of women's suffrage parades, marches, and gatherings around the White House. The deadline for submissions is July 6, 2020. The exhibit is presented by the Office of the Curator in partnership with the Office of the First Lady.
