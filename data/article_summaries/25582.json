President Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force have issued new guidelines to help protect Americans during the global Coronavirus outbreak. These guidelines include practicing strict personal hygiene, washing hands regularly for at least 20 seconds, and wiping down surfaces in the home often. It is emphasized that even if you are young and healthy, you are still at risk of contracting the virus and can potentially spread it to others. President Trump declared a National Emergency in response to the Coronavirus, freeing up over $42 billion in resources for states and localities. The emergency declaration allows healthcare providers on the front lines to have the flexibility they need to respond. The President is ensuring that every Federal resource is available to those who need it and is cutting through unnecessary red tape that may hinder response efforts. The Vice President expressed gratitude towards governors and the American people for their cooperation and compassion during this time.
