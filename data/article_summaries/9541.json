The White House will host an event on May 11th to recognize emerging entrepreneurs from around the world. The event aims to highlight the importance of investing in women and young entrepreneurs to find innovative solutions to global challenges such as poverty, climate change, and access to education and healthcare. The Administration has set a goal for its entrepreneurship programs to generate over a billion dollars in private investment for emerging entrepreneurs by the end of 2017, with half of this goal to be raised for women and young entrepreneurs. The event will also name nine more American entrepreneurs as Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship. The speakers at the event will include entrepreneurs from various U.S. government programs and cast members of ABC's TV series Shark Tank. The event will be live-streamed on the White House website.
