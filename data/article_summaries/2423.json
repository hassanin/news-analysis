The Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to address disparities in resources and opportunities. They have delivered a cumulative investment of $5.8 billion to support HBCUs, including funds for student financial aid, infrastructure upgrades, and campus services. The Build Back Better Act would provide sustained investment in HBCUs and their students. President Biden's FY22 budget request includes $807 million in discretionary funding for HBCUs, an increase of $72 million from last year. Additionally, the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through HBCUs has been re-established, and Tony Allen, President of Delaware State University, has been named Chair of the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs.
