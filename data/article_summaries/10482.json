Columbus, OH Mayor Michael B. Coleman expressed support for President Obama's compromise agreement with Congressional leaders to extend middle-class tax relief and unemployment benefits. He agrees with the President that tax cuts for the wealthiest 2% of Americans should expire in 2012. However, Mayor Coleman believes this deal is necessary to help those in need and stimulate the economy. Without this compromise, income taxes on the middle class would rise, unemployment insurance would expire, and other important tax relief for working people would be unavailable. Mayor Coleman shares President Obama's disappointment that Congressional Republicans insisted on tax cuts for the wealthy in exchange for providing benefits for the unemployed and relief for middle-class taxpayers. Nevertheless, he commends President Obama for his leadership and urges all members of Congress to support the deal.
