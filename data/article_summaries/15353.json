The United States and Poland have a strong defense partnership rooted in their NATO alliance. They work together in the Euro-Atlantic region and globally, sharing values and democratic principles. They collaborate in various areas such as military training, modernization, missile defense, information sharing, and defense/industrial research. They have established an Aviation Detachment to strengthen interoperability through regular training exercises. They are also working on the European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense, with plans to deploy a land-based interceptor site in Poland in 2018. The United States supports Poland's deployments to Afghanistan and assists them in becoming a fully interoperable Special Operations Forces partner nation. They also engage in air defense training through rotations of a Patriot battery to Poland. Both countries have concluded negotiations on a Reciprocal Defense Procurement MOU to facilitate defense cooperation by reducing trade barriers. They maintain regular high-level consultations on various security issues.
