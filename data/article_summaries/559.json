Three college students of Palestinian descent, two of whom are American citizens, were shot in Burlington, Vermont while spending Thanksgiving with family. Prayers are being offered for their recovery and condolences sent to their families. The incident highlights the need to eliminate violence and hate in America. There should be no fear of being shot while going about daily life, and too many Americans have experienced the devastating effects of gun violence. The suspect has been identified and arrested, with federal resources being provided for the investigation.
