Thirteen years ago, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was signed into law, marking an important step towards closing the gender and racial wage gaps. However, there is still work to be done to achieve equal pay. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the essential role of frontline workers, many of whom are women of color and are often paid low wages. Despite their contributions, women continue to be paid less than men, resulting in significant financial losses over their lifetimes. The administration is committed to preventing pay discrimination and has taken action to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors and promote pay equity in the federal workforce. The Paycheck Fairness Act is also being advocated for to provide workers with more tools to fight sex-based discrimination and increase pay transparency. Efforts will focus on prioritizing equal pay, improving job quality for women, and removing barriers to their full participation in the labor force. The White House will host a convening on Equal Pay Day to bring together partners from various sectors to fight for equal pay and enhance the economic security of women and their families.
