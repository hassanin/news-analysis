President Biden is traveling to Selma, Alabama to commemorate the 58th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday, a significant event in the civil rights movement. In 1965, civil rights leaders, including John Lewis, led peaceful protestors demanding voting rights across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where they were brutally beaten by state troopers. The Nation's response to this event led to the passing of the Voting Rights Act, which aimed to protect against racial discrimination in voting and ensure equal access to the ballot for all Americans.

President Biden and Vice President Harris have made it a priority to strengthen democracy and protect the right to vote in free and fair elections. However, state legislatures have passed laws that make it more difficult to vote and undermine the will of the people. To address this, Congress must restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act and pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act to secure the right to vote in every state.

In December 2022, President Biden signed the Electoral Count Reform Act, which establishes clear guidelines for certifying and counting electoral votes to prevent attempts to overturn elections. Congress must show the same determination in passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. President Biden supports eliminating the filibuster to prevent a minority of Senators from blocking action on voting rights.

Meanwhile, the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to using all available tools to protect the right to vote. On the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Biden signed an executive order directing efforts to promote access to voting. Government agencies are working to provide voter registration services and nonpartisan information about elections.
