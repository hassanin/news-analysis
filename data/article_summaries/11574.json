On March 16, 2016, President Barack Obama issued an executive order blocking property of the government of North Korea and the Workers' Party of Korea, and prohibiting certain transactions with respect to North Korea. The order was issued in response to North Korea's pursuit of nuclear and missile programs, which were seen as a threat to the United States and its allies. The order blocks all property and interests in property of the North Korean government and the Workers' Party of Korea, and prohibits any transfer, payment, exportation, withdrawal, or dealing in such property. It also blocks property of individuals or entities involved in various activities, including operating in industries in the North Korean economy, engaging in human rights abuses, exporting workers from North Korea, engaging in cyber attacks, and engaging in censorship. The order also prohibits the exportation or reexportation of goods, services, or technology to North Korea, new investment in North Korea, and any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee of transactions by foreign persons that would be prohibited if performed by a United States person. The order suspends entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet certain criteria. It also prohibits donations to persons whose property is blocked under the order. The order includes various other prohibitions and authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to take necessary actions to carry out its purposes. The order took effect on March 16, 2016.
