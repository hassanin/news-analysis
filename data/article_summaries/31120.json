President Trump met with Republican and Democrat members of the House Ways and Means Committee to discuss tax cuts and tax reform. He outlined four principles for the tax plan: simplification of the tax code, significant tax cuts for the middle class, lower tax rates for businesses to create jobs and higher wages, and bringing back trillions of dollars in wealth parked overseas. Trump also expressed disappointment in Republican senators who opposed the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill and discussed his upcoming trip to Puerto Rico to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Maria. He emphasized the need to provide assistance to the devastated island and praised the efforts of FEMA.
