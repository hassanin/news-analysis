The White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, gave a press briefing discussing recent data on the Affordable Care Act. He highlighted that health care prices have been growing at historically slow rates, hospitals have saved billions of dollars due to fewer unpaid bills, consumers have more competition and choice in the health insurance marketplace, and the average premium for employer-provided family health care coverage has only increased by 3 percent this year. He also addressed questions about the international coalition against the Islamic State, the Secret Service review following the fence-jumping incident, the nomination process for a new Attorney General, recent airstrikes against the Khorasan group, and the threat posed by al Qaeda.
