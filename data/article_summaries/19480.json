The article is a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House, stating his decision to continue the national emergency with respect to Yemen. The letter explains that certain members of the Yemeni government and others are threatening the peace, security, and stability of the country. These individuals are obstructing the implementation of an agreement that aimed to bring about a peaceful transition of power and meet the legitimate demands of the Yemeni people for change. Due to these reasons, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611.
