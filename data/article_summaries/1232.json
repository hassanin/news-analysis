Today marks the one-year anniversary of Congressman John Lewis's passing. He was a champion for freedom, justice, and the right to vote. Despite being beaten during the historic march in Selma, Alabama, he never gave up the fight. The battle for voting rights continues today, and to honor his legacy, we must pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the For the People Act. We should also help eligible voters get registered and ensure their votes are counted. Congressman Lewis believed that our democracy is stronger when everyone participates.
