The Obama administration is dedicated to pursuing evidence-based strategies to address substance use disorders, including integrating treatment into primary health care settings and expanding support services in various institutions.

The proclamation concludes by reaffirming the belief that recovery and limitless opportunity are attainable for all Americans battling substance use disorders.
