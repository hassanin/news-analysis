The United States and the European Union work together on cyber-related issues, with a focus on an open and interoperable Internet, multistakeholder Internet governance, and protecting human rights in cyberspace. They have established the U.S.-EU Cyber Dialogue to formalize and expand their cooperation on international cyberspace developments, human rights protection online, international security issues, and cybersecurity capacity building in third countries. The U.S.-EU Working Group on Cybersecurity and Cybercrime, established in 2010, focuses on cyber incident management, public-private partnerships on critical infrastructure cybersecurity, cybersecurity awareness raising, and cybercrime. The group has conducted various activities, including cyber exercises, workshops, and awareness campaigns. The Information Society Dialogue ensures coordination between the U.S. and EU on communication and information policy issues, such as internet governance, cross-border data flows, data protection, wireless spectrum management, broadband rollout, research and development cooperation, and market access.
