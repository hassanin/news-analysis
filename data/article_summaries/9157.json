President Biden held a virtual meeting with a group of bipartisan senators to discuss Russia's military build-up on Ukraine's borders. The senators had recently returned from a trip to Ukraine, where they reaffirmed the United States' support for Ukraine's sovereignty. The meeting focused on finding ways for the US to work closely with allies and partners to support Ukraine through diplomacy and deterrence measures. President Biden praised the bipartisan support for Ukraine and expressed his commitment to working closely with Congress in imposing consequences for Russian aggression. The senators who attended the meeting were Rob Portman, Jeanne Shaheen, Kevin Cramer, Amy Klobuchar, Chris Murphy, Richard Blumenthal, and Roger Wicker. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Jim Risch also participated in the virtual meeting.
