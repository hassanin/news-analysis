President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has established the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse. The task force is focused on preventing and addressing online harassment and abuse, particularly gender-based violence facilitated by technology platforms. The task force will work to improve coordination among government agencies, enhance data collection and research, increase access to survivor-centered services, develop programs and policies to address online harassment and disinformation campaigns, examine existing laws and regulations, and identify opportunities to address technology-facilitated gender-based violence in foreign policy and assistance. The task force will consist of various government officials and will submit a blueprint outlining its approach within 180 days, followed by an update and report with additional recommendations within one year. The task force will also provide periodic recommendations on technology sector accountability. The memorandum defines technology-facilitated gender-based violence as any form of gender-based violence, including harassment and abuse, that occurs through or is aided by the use of digital technologies and devices. The memorandum does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies and is subject to applicable law and available appropriations.
