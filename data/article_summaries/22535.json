President Obama spoke with President Kagame to discuss the situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Obama emphasized that any support to the rebel group M23 is inconsistent with Rwanda's desire for stability and peace. He stressed the importance of permanently ending all support to armed groups in the DRC, abiding by recent commitments made in Kampala, and reaching a transparent and credible political agreement that includes an end to impunity for M23 commanders and others who have committed serious human rights abuses. Obama believes that a political agreement should address regional security, economic, and governance issues while upholding the DRC's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The two presidents also discussed the longstanding governance problems in the DRC, and Obama welcomed Kagame's commitment to finding a peaceful solution for the eastern DRC.
