President Obama congratulates Kenya on the promulgation of its new constitution, which was approved by a majority of voters. He views this as an important step forward towards unity, democracy, and equal justice for all. The President believes that Kenya's example sets a positive precedent for Africa and the world. The United States looks forward to partnering with Kenya during the implementation process of the new constitution, with the shared expectation that it will deepen democracy and expand economic opportunities for all Kenyans. However, President Obama expresses disappointment that Kenya hosted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. He emphasizes the importance of honoring commitments to international justice for lasting peace.
