During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx discussed the President's announcement regarding transportation infrastructure. Secretary Foxx highlighted two main points: the announcement of the sixth round of TIGER (Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery) grants, a program that has funded 270 projects in all 50 states, and the President's framework to address the challenges with the Highway Trust Fund. The framework includes $302 billion over four years, which will not only fill the gap in the Highway Trust Fund but also provide an additional $90 billion investment in infrastructure. Secretary Foxx emphasized the need for bipartisan support in Congress to prevent the Highway Trust Fund from becoming insolvent. He also discussed the importance of long-term planning and stable funding for infrastructure projects. The press gaggle also touched on topics such as the situation in Ukraine, the upcoming meeting between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, healthcare enrollment numbers, and business tax reform.
