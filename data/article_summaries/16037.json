President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation to establish the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument in northern California. The monument, covering approximately 330,780 acres, is home to a diverse range of wildlife and plant species. The area has significant cultural and historical importance, with evidence of Native American settlements and European-American exploration. The proclamation aims to protect and preserve the scientific, historic, and cultural values of the region for future generations. The management of the monument will be carried out by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, with a joint management plan to be developed. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of protecting Indian sacred sites and ensuring access to traditional cultural and customary uses for members of Indian tribes.
