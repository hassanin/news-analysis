President Trump delivered remarks in the Rose Garden announcing a new action to increase access to affordable healthcare for millions of Americans. The action involves expanding Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs), allowing American workers to choose their own health plans with the help of their employers. The previous administration had imposed restrictions on HRAs, but those restrictions have now been eliminated. The president believes this action will increase choice, promote competition, and lower costs for the American people. He also mentioned other healthcare initiatives his administration has been working on, such as reducing drug prices, combatting the opioid epidemic, and protecting patients with preexisting conditions. The president thanked small business owners who attended the event and shared their experiences with healthcare costs and the benefits of the new rule. Overall, the president emphasized the importance of freedom, choice, and high-quality care in the American healthcare system.
