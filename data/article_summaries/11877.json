President Obama has announced funding for innovative measures to assist families in states that have been hit hardest by the housing crisis. The funding will help housing finance agencies in these states to address urgent problems facing homeowners, such as unemployment and underwater mortgages. The program will provide $1.5 billion to work with state housing agencies to develop programs tailored to local needs. These programs may include assistance for unemployed homeowners, programs to help borrowers who owe more than their home is worth, and programs to address challenges arising from second mortgages. The funding will be subject to accountability and transparency measures, with program designs posted online and program effectiveness measured and published online. The goal of the program is to stabilize the housing market and help responsible homeowners stay in their homes.
