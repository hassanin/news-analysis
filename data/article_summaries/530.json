Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at the C.W. Avery Family YMCA in Plainfield, Illinois, addressing the recent Supreme Court decision on abortion rights. She expressed concern over the decision and emphasized the importance of maternal health as a national priority. Harris stated that millions of women in America will now be without access to reproductive healthcare, and called the decision a healthcare crisis. She argued that the decision not only affects the right to abortion, but also raises questions about other settled rights, such as birth control, same-sex marriage, and interracial marriage. Harris called on people to stand together in defense of liberty and self-determination, and urged them to vote for leaders who will protect their rights. She ended her speech by saying that this fight is not over and encouraged everyone to have faith in the power of their vote.
