President Biden has declared a major disaster for the Poarch Band of Creek Indians due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This declaration enables federal aid to supplement the tribe's efforts in dealing with the pandemic. The funding will be available for crisis counseling and emergency protective measures for the entire tribe. Gracia B. Szczech has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Further designations may be made if requested by the tribe and deemed necessary.
