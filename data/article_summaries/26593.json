President Donald J. Trump has declared an emergency in Puerto Rico due to the conditions resulting from Hurricane Irma. This declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate disaster relief efforts. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency, including debris removal and emergency protective measures. The federal funding for these efforts will be at 75 percent. Alejandro DeLaCampa has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
