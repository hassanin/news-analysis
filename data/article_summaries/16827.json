The article discusses the Returning Heroes and Wounded Warrior Tax Credits, which were included in the American Jobs Act and signed into law by President Obama on November 21, 2011. The Returning Heroes Tax Credit provides businesses with a maximum credit of $5,600 per veteran for hiring unemployed veterans, while the Wounded Warriors Tax Credit offers a maximum credit of $9,600 per veteran for hiring veterans with service-connected disabilities.

The article also mentions several executive actions taken to help get veterans back to work. These include the Veteran Gold Card, which provides enhanced services to post-9/11 veterans, the My Next Move for Veterans online resource that helps veterans find civilian occupations they are qualified for, the Veterans Job Bank that helps veterans find job postings, and the Joining Forces initiative led by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden to encourage the private sector to hire or train veterans and military spouses.

Other initiatives mentioned in the article include the challenge to Community Health Centers to hire 8,000 veterans in three years, the effort to help veterans become physician assistants, and the commitment from over 1,500 private sector companies to employ veterans and spouses. These initiatives aim to lower veteran unemployment, improve resources for veterans to transition to civilian jobs, and provide new tools for veterans in their job search.
