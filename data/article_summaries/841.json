During a press briefing, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo discussed the role of the Department of Commerce in implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. She highlighted how the deal will help close the digital divide in America by providing reliable, high-speed internet to over 30 million Americans who currently lack access, particularly in minority and rural communities. Raimondo emphasized the importance of broadband in areas such as education, healthcare, and economic opportunity. She explained that the Commerce Department will receive $45 billion to administer programs aimed at expanding broadband infrastructure and improving affordability. Raimondo also mentioned that the department will work closely with states, counties, cities, community-based organizations, and the private sector to develop grant programs and ensure efficient implementation. She emphasized the need for equity in the distribution of broadband access and affordability, and expressed confidence in the department's ability to close the digital divide with the resources provided by the infrastructure deal.
