The U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan has announced that HUD will be awarding $2 billion in Recovery Act funding to states, local governments, and non-profit housing developers through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP). The grants aim to stimulate economic development in communities that have been hit hard by the economic crisis and create jobs. The funding will be given to applicants who have developed innovative ideas to rebuild local communities and have demonstrated the ability to responsibly manage taxpayer dollars. The grants will be used to acquire land and property, demolish or rehabilitate abandoned properties, provide down-payment and closing cost assistance to homebuyers, and create "land banks" to manage and sell foreclosed homes. The program also requires housing counseling for families receiving homebuyer assistance funds and protects homebuyers by ensuring that they obtain mortgages from lenders who comply with sound lending practices. This round of NSP grants builds on the work done last year, where nearly $4 billion in NSP formula funds were awarded to over 300 grantees nationwide. The Recovery Act, signed into law in 2009, has already provided tax relief, filled budget gaps for state and local governments, and initiated projects that create jobs and promote long-term economic growth.
