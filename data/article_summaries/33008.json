Charter Communications, a telecommunications company, has committed to investing $25 billion in the United States and hiring 20,000 American workers over the next four years. The company also plans to end its offshore call centers and base all of its call centers in the United States. Charter's CEO, Tom Rutledge, stated that using high-skilled American workers is more cost-effective and leads to better service. The company will be opening a new call center in McAllen, Texas, creating 600 new jobs. This announcement follows similar commitments from other American businesses, such as Exxon, Intel, Lockheed, and Boeing, to invest billions of dollars and create thousands of jobs in the United States.
