In this memorandum, President Barack Obama outlines the need for government reform to ensure competitiveness and innovation in the global economy. He emphasizes the importance of reducing the deficit while investing in areas such as education, innovation, and infrastructure. The current organization of the Federal Government is deemed inadequate for the information age, with agencies growing without strategic planning and duplicative programs hindering goal attainment. The President's administration has already proposed terminations, reductions, and savings in agency programs, as well as consolidating various initiatives. However, further action is required to maximize efficiency and effectiveness in supporting American competitiveness and innovation. The President assigns the Chief Performance Officer the responsibility of leading the effort to restructure and streamline the executive branch, with a focus on trade, exports, and overall competitiveness. The Chief Performance Officer is directed to establish a Government Reform for Competitiveness and Innovation Initiative, conduct a comprehensive review of relevant agencies and programs, and consult with stakeholders. Within 90 days, recommendations for restructuring and streamlining federal programs related to trade and competitiveness should be submitted. Agencies are instructed to provide necessary information and assistance. The memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized to publish the memorandum.
