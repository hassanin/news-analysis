The article discusses the success of a border wall in Yuma, Arizona, and argues that funding the construction of a wall along the Southern border will help secure the homeland and save lives. The Yuma sector, which was previously overwhelmed by illegal immigration and drug trafficking, saw significant improvements after the implementation of a border wall. The bipartisan Secure Fence Act of 2006 mandated the construction of additional miles of secure fencing, and Yuma was one of the first areas to receive infrastructure investments. As a result, apprehensions in the Yuma sector have decreased and crime rates have significantly dropped. The article also criticizes previous lax enforcement policies and encourages Central American and Mexican citizens not to subject themselves or their families to the dangers of human smuggling. It concludes by calling on lawmakers to come together and fully fund the construction of a border wall to provide the Department of Homeland Security with the necessary resources to defend the homeland.
