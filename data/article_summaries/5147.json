The Biden administration has released two presidential directives aimed at advancing quantum technology. These directives are part of the administration's broader approach to cybersecurity and emerging technology policy. The first directive focuses on enhancing the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee, which provides expert advice on quantum information science and technology. The second directive addresses the national security implications of quantum technology, particularly the need to protect against the potential threat of quantum computers breaking current cryptographic standards. The directives emphasize the importance of balancing innovation and security in the field of quantum information science and technology. The administration aims to foster American leadership in quantum tech while mitigating risks. The directives are the beginning of a longer-term effort to update IT infrastructure and protect against future quantum computing threats. The U.S. is also working to maintain leadership in quantum technology compared to other countries and is investing in building a skilled workforce in this area. The cost implications of transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptography are being considered, and a partnership between the government and private sector is expected to drive down costs. Quantum-resistant cryptography can be achieved through classical computers without the need for quantum technology. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is working on developing and deploying quantum-resistant algorithms.
