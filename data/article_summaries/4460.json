During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki addressed several topics. Regarding budget talks on Capitol Hill, Psaki responded to concerns from some Democrats about President Biden's lack of outreach. She stated that the President has spoken with a range of different voices and is focused on working to unify Democrats and reach an agreement to get 50 votes in the Senate. Psaki also discussed the rate of new vaccinations, stating that while rates have declined over time as expected, the requirements and mandates put in place by the government and companies have been effective in increasing vaccination rates. On the topic of the ATF nominee, Psaki expressed frustration that David Chipman was not confirmed and stated that the President has confidence in him and his qualifications. Psaki also provided updates on the ongoing negotiations for the reconciliation package and infrastructure bill, emphasizing that the President is working in lockstep with Speaker Pelosi and is focused on getting both pieces of legislation passed. She stated that the President trusts the Speaker's assessment of what her caucus needs to win the vote and that their objective is to win two votes and move the agenda forward. Psaki also addressed questions about the debt ceiling, the President's role in the negotiations, and the potential for a government shutdown, stating that the White House is working to avoid a shutdown and that the debt ceiling should be raised to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.
