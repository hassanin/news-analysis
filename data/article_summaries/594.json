The Biden-Harris Administration is pledging to defend the constitutional right established in Roe v. Wade, which grants access to reproductive health care. They believe this right should be codified into law and are committed to protecting access to health care, including reproductive health care. They highlight that access to reproductive health care is under attack in states like Texas and Mississippi, and these restrictions disproportionately affect underserved communities, including communities of color and rural areas. The administration supports efforts to codify Roe and will work with Congress on the Women's Health Protection Act. They emphasize that all people deserve access to reproductive health care regardless of their gender, income, race, zip code, health insurance status, immigration status, disability, or sexual orientation. They aim to ensure that future generations have the same fundamental rights as their predecessors and recommit to strengthening access to reproductive health care and defending the constitutional right established by Roe.
