President Barack Obama expressed his concern about child labor on World Day Against Child Labor. He emphasized that even in the modern era, children are being forced to work in dangerous and deplorable conditions instead of attending school or enjoying their childhood. This perpetuates a cycle of poverty that hinders the development of families and nations. In response to this issue, Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis announced a commitment of $60 million to fight child labor. Obama also highlighted the particular plight of young girls, as out of the 218 million child laborers worldwide, 100 million are girls, with over half of them exposed to hazardous work. He called for global unity in opposing child labor and a renewed commitment to ending this practice in all its forms.
