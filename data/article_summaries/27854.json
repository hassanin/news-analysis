President Donald J. Trump is standing up against the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens. The Chinese Civil Aviation Administration recently sent a letter demanding that foreign air carriers, including American carriers, change how they refer to "Taiwan," "Hong Kong," and "Macao" on their websites and promotional material. The Trump administration sees this as an attempt by China to impose its political views on American citizens and private companies. The United States strongly objects to China's attempts to compel private firms to use specific language of a political nature in their publicly available content. The US is calling on China to stop threatening and coercing American carriers and citizens.
