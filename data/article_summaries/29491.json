The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has released a report highlighting the positive effects of youth sports on children's lives. The report states that participating in youth sports can improve physical health and help develop valuable life skills. However, it also notes that girls and children from lower-income families have lower participation rates compared to boys and those from higher-income families. The report suggests that even small investments in youth sports can have a positive impact on children, promoting an active lifestyle and facilitating positive mentorship and peer relationships. The evidence reviewed by the CEA indicates a positive relationship between youth sports participation and outcomes in children's lives.
