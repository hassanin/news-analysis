The President has been in communication with members of the House and Senate regarding the latest infrastructure proposal. He informed Senator Capito that her group's offer did not meet the country's essential needs. Despite being willing to reduce his plan by over $1 trillion, the Republican group only increased their proposed investments by $150 billion. The President also spoke with Senators Sinema, Cassidy, and Manchin, urging them to continue bipartisan work on a proposal that addresses the country's infrastructure needs. While in Europe, he plans to stay in contact with the group and designated his Jobs Cabinet and White House aides to meet with them in person. The President has maintained his stance on not raising taxes for Americans making under $400,000 and not accepting inaction. He consulted with Speaker Pelosi on advancing a jobs package in the House and discussed the need to start the budget resolution process with Senate Majority Leader Schumer. The President is committed to pushing his economic legislation through Congress this summer and is exploring different approaches to achieve this.
