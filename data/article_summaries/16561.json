The Vice President, Joe Biden, issued a statement in response to a new report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on the employment and economic impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The report confirms that the Recovery Act is working to rescue the economy and rebuild it stronger than before. The CBO states that as many as 3.3 million Americans are employed today because of the Recovery Act, and the unemployment rate is up to 1.8 percent lower. This report provides further evidence that we can't afford to go backward and must continue to move forward with measures like the Recovery Act to create jobs and compete in the 21st century economy.
