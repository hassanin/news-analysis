The President and First Lady, Michelle and Barack Obama, send warm wishes to families celebrating Kwanzaa. They acknowledge that Kwanzaa is a week-long celebration of African-American heritage and culture, and highlight the seven principles of Kwanzaa: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith. These principles are seen as shared values that unite Americans. The Obamas also reflect on the blessings of the past year and express their commitment to building a brighter future for all children. They send their best wishes for a happy and healthy new year as families come together to light the Kinara.
