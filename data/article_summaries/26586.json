On December 12, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order establishing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. The purpose of this council is to encourage public and private investment in economically distressed communities, including qualified opportunity zones. The council will be chaired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Vice Chair will be the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. The council consists of various members from executive departments and agencies, and its mission is to prioritize federal investments and programs in distressed communities, minimize regulatory burdens that discourage investment, and coordinate efforts to stimulate economic development. The council will also evaluate policies and methods to support economic growth, identify federal resources for community development, and measure the effectiveness of investments in distressed communities. The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy will be responsible for submitting reports to the President on the council's work, including a detailed work plan, recommended changes to federal statutes and policies, best practices for economic growth, and any subsequent reports requested by the President. The executive order also amends a previous executive order related to the President's National Council for the American Worker. The council will terminate on January 21, 2021, unless extended by the President.
