The article discusses the High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program in Florida. The program aims to create a new high-speed rail corridor connecting Tampa Bay, Orlando, Miami, and other communities in central and south Florida. The region has experienced significant population growth and increased visitor volume, leading to strains on roads and airports. The new rail service will provide an alternative transportation option for residents and visitors. The first phase will connect Orlando to Tampa, with intermediate stops at major tourist destinations. The second phase will connect Orlando to Miami. The investments in high-speed rail are expected to create jobs and stimulate economic activity in Florida. The Tampa-Orlando segment will have speeds of up to 168mph and completion is anticipated in 2014. The Orlando-Miami line, expected to operate at speeds up to 186mph, is scheduled for completion in 2017.
