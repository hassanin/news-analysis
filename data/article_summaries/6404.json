Vice President Kamala Harris held a discussion with American business leaders about the importance of small businesses in the country's economy. She emphasized that small businesses are not only crucial for economic growth but also play a significant role in communities. The Vice President focused on increasing access to capital for minority- and women-owned small businesses, which have historically faced challenges in this area. The discussion also touched on issues such as childcare, eldercare, and paid family leave, which are vital for supporting working people. The leaders present at the discussion represented a variety of small businesses, including restaurants, construction companies, architectural design firms, and IT consulting firms. The Vice President highlighted that Hispanic small businesses encompass a wide range of industries and are essential for a productive society. The Biden administration has implemented various policies to support small businesses, including funding from the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. The Build Back Better plan aims to lower costs for childcare and eldercare, cut taxes for families with children, and create jobs through workforce training and apprenticeships. Vice President Harris thanked Congresswoman Barrag√°n for her leadership in Congress on these issues.
