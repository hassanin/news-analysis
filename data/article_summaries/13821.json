He also mentioned that the President had a phone conversation with the Cuban President, Raul Castro, and that the Pope and the Vatican played a role in facilitating the release of Alan Gross. Earnest stated that the US government does not plan to change its designation of Hamas as a terrorist organization, despite the recent decision by the European Union to remove Hamas from its terrorist list. He also mentioned that the US government does not plan to lift the embargo on Cuba until it sees progress in the areas of human rights and democracy. Finally, Earnest discussed the recent ban on fracking in New York state, stating that the President believes it is important for fracking operations to be conducted in a way that does not harm the health and well-being of people who live in the area.
