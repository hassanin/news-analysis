Congressman Michael E. McMahon has expressed his support for President Obama's decision to extend the Bush tax cuts for two years and unemployment benefits for thirteen months. McMahon believes that raising taxes during a recession is not advisable and that extending the tax cuts will benefit middle-class families and small businesses. He also emphasizes the importance of extending unemployment benefits for those who are still struggling to find work. McMahon sees this as a common-sense approach to help the economy recover and reduce the deficit. He commends President Obama for his willingness to compromise and prioritize the needs of the American people over political interests.
