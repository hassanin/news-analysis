The United States Navy currently uses highly enriched uranium in its submarines and aircraft carriers for their reactors. However, in an effort to minimize the use of highly enriched uranium globally and for national security reasons, the United States is exploring the feasibility of using low-enriched uranium in its naval reactors. Previous studies conducted in 1995 and 2014 concluded that existing naval reactor designs are not suitable for low-enriched uranium due to the impact it would have on reactor lifetime, size, and ship costs. However, the 2014 report suggested that it is possible to develop an advanced fuel system that could allow for the use of low-enriched uranium with less impact on these factors. In response to a directive from Congress, the Navy and Department of Energy are now working on a conceptual research and development plan for such an advanced fuel system.
