This memorandum, issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 22, 2020, addresses the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The memorandum states that it is the policy of the United States to assist state governors in their responses to threats and hazards to the American people. Due to the seriousness of the public health risks posed by COVID-19, cooperation between the federal government and states is crucial. The memorandum highlights the declaration of a national emergency and the activation of Emergency Operations Centers in all states. To provide support to the governors of California, New York, and Washington, the memorandum directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fund 100% of the emergency assistance activities conducted by these states using their National Guard forces. Additionally, the memorandum directs the Secretary of Defense to request that these states order National Guard forces to fulfill mission assignments issued by FEMA on a reimbursable basis. The memorandum includes general provisions and emphasizes that it does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits.
