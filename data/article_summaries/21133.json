President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New Jersey and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in February 2010. The federal funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Assistance will also be provided for emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation measures. William L. Vogel has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
