President Obama will be visiting auto plants in Michigan and Illinois to highlight the success of the auto industry since his decision to save Chrysler and General Motors. These companies have returned to profitability, hired workers, and kept plants open. The Hamtramck GM plant is one of nine that remained open during a scheduled shutdown, and the Jefferson North Chrysler plant added a second shift, creating approximately 1,100 jobs. The Chicago Ford plant plans to add 1,200 new jobs with the help of Department of Energy loan guarantees for clean energy upgrades.
