Karen Pence, the Second Lady of the United States, visited the Florida Hospital Cancer Institute in Orlando to learn about the impact of art therapy on patients. She met with two patients who shared their experiences with art therapy. Julie, a cancer patient, initially resisted seeing an art therapist but later found it helpful in focusing on her future and maintaining a hopeful outlook. Anne, a colon cancer survivor, continues to attend art therapy sessions to address lingering issues related to her illness. Both patients emphasized how art therapy helped them unlock buried emotions and process them in a therapeutic setting. The session was accompanied by soft flute music played by a music therapist. Pence commended Florida Hospital for its vibrant art and music therapy programs and expressed her dedication to promoting art therapy nationally and internationally. She encouraged readers to learn more about her initiative, "Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART."
