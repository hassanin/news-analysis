The Council of Economic Advisers discusses the slow recovery of labor incomes in the United States since the Great Recession. While government transfers have offset the decline in household income, this level of redistribution is not sustainable without substantial increases in economic growth. The administration's actions on tax and regulatory reforms, as well as infrastructure investment, aim to stimulate economic growth and increase the demand for workers. However, reductions in disincentives to work and increased enforcement of work provisions and eligibility requirements in welfare programs are also necessary. The administration is also implementing supply-side tools such as retraining programs, addressing the opioid crisis, improving broadband access, and increasing geographic mobility to boost the labor supply. Policies that incentivize work at older ages and encourage practical labor force training for younger workers are also discussed. Overall, changes in public policies are seen as important mechanisms for getting workers back into the workforce and fully participating in the economy.
