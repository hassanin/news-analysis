The White House has announced the launch of "Digital Promise," a new national center aimed at advancing technologies in teaching and learning. The center will receive funding from the Department of Education, as well as the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. It will be overseen by a board of leaders in education and technology appointed by Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Digital Promise will work with researchers, entrepreneurs, and schools to identify and promote breakthrough learning technologies, evaluate their effectiveness, and transform the fragmented learning technology market. The initiative is in line with President Obama's goal of out-innovating and out-educating other countries. The center will focus on three key challenges: identifying breakthrough technologies, evaluating their effectiveness quickly, and transforming the market for learning technologies. The launch of Digital Promise was accompanied by several other announcements, including new awards from the National Science Foundation to support research on next-generation learning environments.
