The President of the United States has sent a message to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe will continue beyond March 6, 2011. The crisis caused by certain members of the Zimbabwean government and others undermining the country's democratic processes and institutions has not been resolved. Although there have been some economic improvements, the lack of progress in fundamental reforms threatens peace and security in the region and the foreign policy of the United States. Politically motivated violence and intimidation are ongoing concerns. The President has determined that it is necessary to maintain sanctions in response to this threat, but also expresses willingness to modify the sanctions if there is a clear commitment to the rule of law, democracy, and human rights. The United States continues to review the sanctions list and hopes to take further action in the future if there is progress towards a peaceful and democratic Zimbabwe.
