This article is about an executive order issued by President Obama in September 2016. The executive order amends Executive Order 13467 to establish the roles and responsibilities of the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB) and related matters. The order states that the NBIB will be responsible for conducting effective, efficient, and secure personnel background investigations for the federal government. It also outlines the responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense in designing and operating information technology systems that support background investigations. The order further states that existing delegations and designations of investigative authority will remain in effect until amended or revoked. The order also calls for a review and update of executive-level authorities across the vetting enterprise to clarify and de-conflict existing authorities and address necessary governance changes. Finally, the order amends Executive Order 12171 to include the National Background Investigations Bureau as one of the agencies or subdivisions of the Office of Personnel Management.
