On May 5, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation recognizing Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives Awareness Day. The proclamation acknowledges the generations of injustice endured by these communities and the high rates of violence, including domestic violence, sexual assault, and abuse, particularly against women and girls. The administration expresses its commitment to ending this violence and supporting tribal governments in their efforts to address the issue. The Department of Justice has awarded grants to improve public safety and combat violence against women in these communities, while the Department of the Interior is taking action to address critical concerns through roundtables and equipping officers to handle cold cases and child abduction investigations. The Department of Health and Human Services is also prioritizing the health and safety of American Indian and Alaska Native communities through prevention, health, and education activities. The proclamation also highlights the establishment of Operation Lady Justice, an interagency task force focused on ending the cycle of violence and providing grants to improve public safety. The proclamation calls on all Americans and governments to increase awareness of this crisis through appropriate programs and activities.
