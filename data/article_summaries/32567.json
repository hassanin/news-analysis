On October 27, 2006, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This was done through Executive Order 13413, which ordered measures to block the property of certain individuals contributing to the conflict in the country. The President took this action due to the widespread violence and atrocities occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which posed a threat to regional stability and the foreign policy of the United States.

In 2014, President Trump further addressed this national emergency through Executive Order 13671. The situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States, thus requiring the national emergency to remain in effect beyond October 27, 2019. As per the National Emergencies Act, President Trump is continuing the national emergency for an additional year.

This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
