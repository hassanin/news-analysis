President Obama held a meeting at the White House to discuss the economic impact of infrastructure investment. The meeting included Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, former Transportation Secretaries Norman Mineta and Samuel Skinner, and several governors and mayors. The group discussed the current state of transportation infrastructure, the challenges in improving it, and the short and long-term economic impact of new infrastructure investment. President Obama emphasized the need for a long-term plan to rebuild and modernize roads, railways, and airports in the United States. Secretary Geithner highlighted the immediate and future benefits of investing in transportation infrastructure, including creating middle-class jobs and increasing productivity and exports. The group also discussed a new report from the Treasury Department and Council of Economic Advisers, which found that investing in infrastructure would have a positive economic impact by increasing production, improving U.S. competitiveness, and generating jobs in construction, industrial production, and retail sectors. The full report can be found on the White House website.
