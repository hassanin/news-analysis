The White House and the U.S. Department of Energy have announced new commitments by over 120 businesses, non-profits, and schools to purchase electric vehicles (EVs) and technologies and to install workplace charging stations. This is part of the Obama Administration's efforts to combat climate change and reduce dependence on oil. Some of the commitments include over 70 electric utility companies devoting at least 5 percent of their annual fleet acquisition budgets to purchasing EVs and technologies, as well as 61 businesses committing to install workplace charging stations. The U.S. Department of Energy will also support new projects to enable aggregated purchases of EVs and other advanced technology vehicles. The goal is to make EVs as affordable as gasoline-powered vehicles for the average American family. Since 2009, the cost of battery technology for EVs has already decreased by more than 60 percent. The number of EV models available to consumers has also increased, and sales have grown rapidly in recent years.
