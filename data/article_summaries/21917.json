The article announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The President declared this national emergency on November 14, 1994, due to the threat posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and the means of delivering them. The President issued subsequent executive orders in 1998 and 2005 to address this threat more effectively. The national emergency is being extended for another year, as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction continues to pose a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
