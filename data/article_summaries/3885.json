The White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, and the Department of Agriculture Under Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation, Robert Bonnie, led a call to discuss the Department of Agriculture's new Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program. This program will invest $1 billion to support farmers, ranchers, and foresters in implementing practices that reduce greenhouse gases and store carbon in soils, trees, and vegetation. The program aims to fund pilots and demonstration projects that encourage climate-smart production, measure and verify greenhouse gas benefits, and connect these commodities to markets that value them. The initiative is expected to gather more information than ever before on the climate benefits of the agricultural and forestry sectors. The program also emphasizes equity, ensuring that smaller and underserved producers benefit from the program.
