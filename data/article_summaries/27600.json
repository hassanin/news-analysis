President Trump has commuted the sentence of Roger Stone, a long-time associate who was charged with crimes related to the Mueller investigation. Stone was not charged with collusion with Russia, as no evidence of such a crime was found. Instead, he was charged for his conduct during the investigation. The President argues that Stone would not be facing prison time if the investigation had not been baseless. The Mueller prosecutors also faced criticism for the way they arrested Stone, using excessive force and making it a public spectacle. There were also concerns about the jury, as the forewoman was found to have a bias against President Trump. Stone has appealed his conviction and maintains his innocence. The President believes that Stone deserves a fair trial and has decided to commute his sentence.
