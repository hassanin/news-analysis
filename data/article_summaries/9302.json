Vice President Kamala Harris announced a $600 million investment in 11 organizations with close community ties to fund local environmental justice projects. These grants aim to address the disproportionate levels of air, water, and soil pollution faced by low-income communities, immigrant communities, Native communities, and communities of color in the United States. The investment is structured in a way that prioritizes speed and impact, as it will be administered by community organizations that understand the needs of their communities. Harris emphasized that this investment is a down payment, and the administration will continue to fight for resources to advance environmental justice and ensure clean air, clean water, and healthy communities for all.
