President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of North Carolina, providing federal aid to help with recovery efforts from severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred from July 3-13, 2013. The declaration makes federal funding available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Jackson, Macon, Madison, Mitchell, Polk, Watauga, and Yancey, as well as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, are eligible for this assistance. Hazard mitigation measures are also eligible for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for all counties and tribes within the state. Michael Bolch has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
