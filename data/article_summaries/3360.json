Narges Mohammadi has been awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her commitment to fighting for human rights and gender equality in Iran. Despite enduring arrests, persecution, and torture by the Iranian regime, Mohammadi's advocacy has only grown stronger. However, she is currently unjustly held in Evin prison. The article calls for her immediate release, as well as the release of other gender equality advocates. It also highlights the recent assault on Armita Geravand by Iran's morality police for not wearing a headscarf. The people of Iran continue to fight for a free and democratic future, demanding respect for their human rights. The United States is supporting Iranians' ability to advocate for their own future through diplomatic initiatives, anti-censorship tools, and sanctions against individuals and entities supporting the regime's oppression. The United States will continue to stand with Mohammadi, the people of Iran, and those working for equality and freedom worldwide.
