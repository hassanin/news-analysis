Congressman Scott Murphy from New York released a statement in support of President Obama's tax cut compromise. He acknowledges the two major problems currently faced by the country: high unemployment rates and a large deficit. Despite not agreeing with all the provisions in the compromise, Murphy believes that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. He states that the plan would help businesses create jobs, ease the tax burden on middle-class families, and address the long-term fiscal crisis. Murphy emphasizes the need to balance immediate economic recovery with long-term fiscal concerns. He sees the compromise as a bipartisan solution that Congress should act on now to protect middle-class families from a potential tax increase.
