The article discusses the declaration of a national emergency by the President of the United States with respect to Sudan. The national emergency was initially declared in 1997 and was expanded in 2006 due to the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan, particularly in the Darfur region. The President took additional steps to address the emergency and implemented the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006. However, in 2017, positive efforts by the Government of Sudan led to the revocation of certain executive orders related to the national emergency. In 2021, Sudan made progress towards democracy, but a military takeover in October 2021 reversed those gains. As a result, the national emergency declared in 1997 and expanded in 2006 must continue beyond November 3, 2022, due to the ongoing crisis and the threat it poses to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
