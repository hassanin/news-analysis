The President thanks Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson and the U.S. Conference of Mayors for establishing a Mayors Task Force dedicated to the "My Brother's Keeper" initiative. This initiative aims to ensure that every young person, especially boys and young men of color, can reach their potential. The task force will focus on expanding early childhood programs, promoting public-private partnerships for more summer jobs, enhancing existing mentorship programs, and eliminating suspensions and expulsions in preschool and early learning settings. The President commends the mayors for prioritizing these issues in their communities and expresses the desire to work with them to expand opportunities and improve outcomes for all children in America.
