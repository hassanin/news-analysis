In this press gaggle, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney discusses the ongoing negotiations for the fiscal year 2011 budget. President Obama has called for a meeting with congressional leaders to reach an agreement on the budget. Carney states that the President believes a deal is possible and that the Democrats have already come more than halfway towards the Republican position on spending cuts. The President wants to get a deal done so that the country can move on to other important issues. Carney also mentions that the President will be meeting with Israeli President Shimon Peres to discuss events in the Middle East and efforts towards finding compromise on the Middle East peace process. On the topic of the one-week stopgap measure proposed by Speaker Boehner to prevent a government shutdown, Carney does not provide a clear answer on whether the President supports it or not. He emphasizes that the focus should be on reaching an agreement for the full year and that short-term measures are not productive. Carney also briefly mentions that the administration is considering additional sanctions on senior members of Qaddafi's circle in Libya to encourage more defections. He declines to comment on Congressman Ryan's budget proposal, stating that he will address questions about it in a later briefing. Carney also mentions that the President remains committed to closing Guantanamo and that the administration is engaged in ongoing efforts to work towards that goal.
