First Lady Melania Trump has announced a new awareness campaign called BE BEST, which focuses on addressing major issues facing children today. The campaign aims to encourage children to be their best in all aspects of life and educate them about the importance of social, emotional, and physical health. The three main pillars of the campaign are well-being, social media use, and opioid abuse. It will promote values such as healthy living, kindness, and respect to help children navigate challenges and avoid negative social media interactions. Additionally, BE BEST will support families affected by the opioid crisis, raise awareness about neonatal abstinence syndrome, and educate parents on healthy pregnancies. The campaign was launched in the White House Rose Garden and was attended by children who have written to the First Lady. More details about BE BEST can be found at www.BeBest.gov.
