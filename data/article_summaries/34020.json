In a recent order, a district judge has prevented the Trump Administration from keeping families together during their immigration proceedings. This ruling perpetuates a loophole that the judge previously created, which has been exploited by criminal cartels to smuggle children across the Southern Border of the United States, often leading to their physical and sexual abuse. The Trump Administration has been working to enforce the laws enacted by Congress, while activist judges have imposed their own interpretations instead. The Flores 20-day Loophole, which allows for the release of detained children after 20 days, violates Congressional removal and detention mandates and needs to be stopped.
