On June 3, 2011, President Barack Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding the Jerusalem Embassy Act. The Memorandum states that the President has determined that it is necessary to suspend the limitations set forth in sections 3(b) and 7(b) of the Act for a period of 6 months in order to protect the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to transmit this determination to Congress, along with a report, and to publish the determination in the Federal Register. The suspension will take effect after the transmission of the determination and report to Congress.
