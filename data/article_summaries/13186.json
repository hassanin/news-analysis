President Obama has appointed Major General J. Scott Gration as the U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan. Sudan is a priority for the Obama administration, particularly due to the worsening humanitarian crisis in the country. The appointment of General Gration, who has both military and humanitarian experience, is seen as a strong signal of the administration's commitment to supporting the people of Sudan and seeking a lasting settlement to the violence in the region. The government of Sudan's decision to expel humanitarian relief organizations will have negative consequences and they will be held accountable for the lives lost. The administration will also continue to work with both parties to Sudan's Comprehensive Peace Agreement to ensure its full implementation.
