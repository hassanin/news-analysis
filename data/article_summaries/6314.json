The United States and G7 partners have announced their commitment to defeat COVID-19 through financing, donations, and capacity building. They have pledged to provide more than one billion safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to accelerate global coverage. Since 2020, the G7 has committed to financing and providing approximately 2.3 billion vaccines worldwide, with the United States contributing nearly half of that support. This includes expanding local production capacity to add over a billion doses to the global vaccine supply by the end of 2022. The G7 has previously committed to financing and sharing over one billion doses, and their investment in local vaccine production capacity will support at least one billion doses by the end of 2022. The United States is urging countries to donate additional doses, strengthen vaccine readiness, and collaborate with the private sector to vaccinate the world. They will also continue to share doses from their domestic supply as they become available.
