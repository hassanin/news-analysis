The article discusses the G-8 Muskoka Summit and its commitment to transparency and accountability. President Obama believes that the credibility of the G-8 relies on members honoring their commitments by reporting progress transparently and identifying areas that require more effort. The G-8 released the Accountability Report: G-8 Action and Results, which assesses the extent to which the G-8 has fulfilled its commitments, with a focus on development and development-related commitments. The report emphasizes the impact of G-8 initiatives and the importance of improving development outcomes on the ground. This focus on development is timely, given the commitments made to Africa at Gleneagles five years ago and the upcoming United Nations review of progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals. The United States has demonstrated leadership in several key G-8 development commitments, such as increasing Official Development Assistance to Africa, focusing investments in the poorest countries, providing debt relief, enhancing trade and investment, mobilizing resources for global health challenges, promoting agricultural development and food security, and strengthening peacekeeping capacity.
