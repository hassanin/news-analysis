Vice President Kamala Harris addressed a quarterly meeting of the Declaration for American Democracy, praising their efforts to protect the right to participate in democracy. She acknowledged the record voter turnout in 2020 but expressed concern over the passing of anti-voter laws in various states. Harris emphasized that these laws are designed to make it harder for people to vote and undermine the integrity of the voting process. She called on Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, stating that these bills would establish basic voting standards and prevent obstructionist tactics. Harris acknowledged the unwillingness of Senate Republicans to debate these bills but emphasized the need to continue fighting for voting rights. She shared her experiences from meetings with activists, advocates, policymakers, and voters across the country who are committed to ensuring that everyone's vote is counted. Harris stressed that the right to vote is a cornerstone of democracy and expressed gratitude for the work being done to protect it.
