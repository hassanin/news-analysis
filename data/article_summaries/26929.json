First Lady Melania Trump joined President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in the Oval Office for the signing of the Executive Order on Strengthening the Child Welfare System for America's Children. This executive order aligns with the goals of Melania Trump's Be Best initiative, which aims to improve the well-being of children and youth in foster care. In May, Melania Trump urged governors to designate child welfare staff as first responders to ensure they have access to Personal Protective Equipment during face-to-face interventions amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The First Lady and the Trump Administration have also provided guidance for remote court hearings in child welfare cases and supported caseworkers through videoconferencing for monthly visits. The Executive Order focuses on three key actions: improving partnerships, improving resources, and improving oversight. Melania Trump hopes that this order will bring about reforms and demonstrate the administration's commitment to the health and safety of children in the United States.
