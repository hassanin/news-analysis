The Biden-Harris Administration has announced that approximately 18 million students have received direct financial aid through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) since the beginning of 2021. This fund was expanded by President Biden in the American Rescue Plan (ARP). The Department of Education's report shows that a significant portion of the ARP funds, amounting to tens of billions of dollars, has gone directly to students in the form of emergency financial aid grants and the discharge of unpaid student account balances. First Lady Jill Biden, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, and American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling discussed the impact of these funds on a call with Delaware State President Tony Allen and students who have benefited from the HEERF funds. The funds have helped students avoid dropping out during the pandemic, afford college costs, and meet basic needs such as food, housing, transportation, and child care. The assistance provided by HEERF is also expected to contribute to a stronger post-pandemic workforce. The Department's data shows that approximately 50% of the total HEERF funds have directly supported students through emergency aid grants. HEERF is part of the Administration's broader efforts to support students and borrowers, including making community college free and investing in sectors like manufacturing, infrastructure, and clean energy to create more job opportunities.
