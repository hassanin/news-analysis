On December 19, 2011, the President signed three bills into law. The first is S. 535, the "Fort Pulaski National Monument Lease Authorization Act," which allows the Department of the Interior to lease certain lands and improvements within the Fort Pulaski National Monument to the Savannah Bar Pilots Association. The second is S. 683, the "Box Elder Utah Land Conveyance Act," which instructs the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer about 31.5 acres of public lands to the town of Mantua, Utah, without any payment. The third is S.J.Res. 22, which grants Congress's consent to an amendment made by Missouri and Illinois to the Compact that established the Bi-State Development Agency. This amendment permits the Agency to issue bonds with a maturity of up to 40 years, rather than the previous limit of 30 years.
