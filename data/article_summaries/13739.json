The joint statement by the Presidents of the United States and Russia discusses the need to improve cooperation on visa issues between the two countries. They express their determination to strengthen bilateral ties and expand economic and trade relations. They acknowledge that the current state of visa procedures does not match the level of collaboration and bilateral relations they hope to achieve. They intend to streamline the visa process to make travel easier, particularly for business travelers, tourists, and official representatives. They are working on a new agreement to issue multiple-entry visas for eligible business travelers and tourists for 36 months, as well as 12-month, multiple-entry visas for official representatives. They aim to sign the agreement in the near future and seek further simplification and liberalization of visa systems in the future.
