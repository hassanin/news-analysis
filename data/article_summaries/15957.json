President Obama has declared September 2014 as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month in the United States. In his proclamation, he highlights the impact of pediatric cancer on thousands of young Americans and the need to combat this disease. The President acknowledges the progress made in pediatric cancer research and treatment, with mortality rates decreasing by over 50% in the past 30 years. He emphasizes the importance of supporting scientific advances and calls on Congress to invest in the 10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund. The Affordable Care Act is also mentioned, as it improves access to quality and affordable healthcare for families, including those affected by childhood cancer. The proclamation encourages Americans to remember those who have lost their lives to pediatric cancer, support families and children battling cancer, and work towards a future where all children are free from this disease.
