President Biden has shown commitment to supporting Puerto Rico since his first day in office by providing unprecedented levels of federal funding for resilience, recovery, infrastructure, and economic growth. To further this support, the White House hosted the first Puerto Rico Economic Dialogue, bringing together Puerto Rico's leadership and the White House Working Group on Puerto Rico. The meeting aimed to develop a comprehensive plan for joint action to promote the island's economic growth. Both governments agreed on shared priorities, which include investments in Puerto Rico, improved coordination of disaster recovery funding, and long-term partnership and transparency. Various actions were announced in areas such as human capital and workforce development, infrastructure, energy and resilience, broadband, economic development, governance and data, and more.
