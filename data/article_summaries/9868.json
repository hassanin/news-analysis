This article is a press gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest aboard Air Force One en route to Decatur, Georgia. The President will be discussing an initiative to expand high-quality preschool education for every child in America. Studies show that for every dollar invested in a quality preschool program, more than 7 dollars are saved due to the positive impact on graduation rates, teen pregnancy rates, and even violent crime rates.

The President will call on members of Congress in both parties to act quickly on this issue.
