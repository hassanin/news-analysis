The National Security Memorandum, NSM-8, outlines the requirements for improving the cybersecurity of National Security Systems (NSS), Department of Defense, and Intelligence Community Systems. It establishes that NSS should meet or exceed the cybersecurity requirements set forth in Executive Order 14028 and provides methods for securing exceptions based on unique mission needs. The memorandum assigns additional authority and responsibilities to the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) in connection with NSS. It defines NSS as systems defined in 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(6) and includes all Department of Defense and Intelligence Community systems. The memorandum provides instructions for the implementation of Executive Order 14028 for NSS, including the development of guidance for minimum security standards and controls related to cloud migration, adoption of Zero Trust Architecture, and implementation of multifactor authentication and encryption. It also establishes the National Manager's authorities relating to NSS, including incident reporting, directives, and coordination of cross-domain solutions. The memorandum allows for exceptions to cybersecurity requirements under certain circumstances and requires agencies to maintain records of system exceptions. The memorandum concludes with provisions for policy creation and adjustments, and it clarifies that it does not alter existing authorities or interfere with ongoing investigations.
