President Joe Biden has proclaimed April 2021 as National Fair Housing Month, commemorating the signing of the Fair Housing Act by President Lyndon B. Johnson 53 years ago. The Fair Housing Act was enacted to eliminate racial segregation in American neighborhoods and ensure equal access to housing without discrimination. The law prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing and requires governments to dismantle discriminatory structures. While progress has been made, there is still work to be done to achieve the goals of the Fair Housing Act, as many neighborhoods remain segregated, and the racial wealth gap has widened. President Biden has taken steps to address these disparities through executive orders and memoranda, aiming to advance racial equity and close persistent gaps in wages, housing, credit, lending opportunities, and access to education. The administration is committed to ending unlawful housing discrimination and fulfilling the promise of the Fair Housing Act.
