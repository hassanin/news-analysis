President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued an Executive Order expanding the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997, and expanded by Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 2006, regarding Sudan. The situation in Sudan, including the military's seizure of power in October 2021 and inter-service fighting in April 2023, is deemed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The policy of the United States is to support a transition to democracy and civilian transitional government in Sudan, defend the transitional government from those who would prevent its formation through violence, and protect it once formed. The United States, along with like-minded partners, will assist the transitional government in meeting the needs of the Sudanese people and preparing for democratic elections. The Executive Order imposes sanctions on individuals engaged in actions or policies that threaten Sudan's peace, security, or stability; undermine the formation or operation of a civilian transitional government; hinder Sudan's transition to democracy or a future democratically elected government; undermine democratic processes or institutions in Sudan; limit freedom of expression, association, or peaceful assembly through censorship or other actions; engage in corruption or serious human rights abuses; target women, children, or civilians; obstruct United Nations missions; or launch attacks against United Nations missions.
