President Biden announced that the United States has administered 200 million COVID-19 vaccine shots within his first 100 days in office. This goal was achieved ahead of schedule, as the initial target was to reach 100 million shots in the same timeframe. The President praised the efforts of the American people, including volunteers, healthcare workers, and government agencies, in achieving this milestone. He also highlighted the impact of the vaccination effort, noting that it has already saved tens of thousands of American lives. Moving forward, the President announced that all adults over the age of 16 are now eligible to receive the vaccine. He emphasized the importance of vaccination in preventing illness and protecting the community. To encourage vaccination, the President called on employers to provide paid time off for employees to get vaccinated and recover from any side effects. He also mentioned plans to assist other countries in their vaccination efforts once the U.S. has sufficient supply. President Biden urged Americans to remain vigilant, continue wearing masks, and get vaccinated to ensure a return to normalcy by July 4th.
