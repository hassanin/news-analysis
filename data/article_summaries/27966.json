According to a 2018 estimate from the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia have remained high but are leveling off. The estimate shows a minor decrease in coca cultivation in 2018 compared to 2017, as well as a decrease in potential pure cocaine production. Although coca cultivation in Colombia is still at historically high levels, it did not increase for the first time since 2012. President Iv√°n Duque has increased counter-narcotics efforts in Colombia since taking office in 2018, targeting cocaine labs and traffickers. The goal is to significantly reduce coca cultivation and cocaine production. Drug traffickers move large quantities of cocaine from Colombia to the United States, primarily across the Southwest border. The increase in cocaine-involved overdose deaths and current cocaine users in the United States highlights the need to combat the drug trade and prevent the flow of deadly drugs into the country.
