The White House released a readout of the President's meeting with senators on September 10, 2009. The meeting lasted for over an hour and took place in the Roosevelt Room. The President and the senators reached a unanimous agreement that the health care reform bill should not add to the deficit, and measures should be included to reduce long-term deficits. The President appreciated the senators' support and thanked them for their constructive suggestions on making the legislation provide more stability to those with insurance, access to insurance for those without it, and lower the cost of healthcare for families, businesses, and governments. The President also urged the senators to continue providing suggestions and feedback as the process moves forward.
