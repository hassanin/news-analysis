The White House Council on Women and Girls has released a report on advancing equity for women and girls of color. The report highlights the innovative solutions and place-based work happening throughout the country. A forum will be held to discuss ways to break down barriers to success and create more opportunities for all Americans, including women and girls of color. The report builds on previous reports released in 2014 and 2015, identifying barriers and disparities faced by women and girls of color in areas such as education, economic security, health, safety, and justice. The report also outlines five data-driven issue areas where interventions can promote success for women and girls of color, including school success, meeting the needs of vulnerable youth, increasing access to STEM education, reducing teen pregnancy rates, and expanding economic opportunities. The Obama Administration has made significant strides in addressing these issues and inspiring further efforts from philanthropic leaders, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations.
