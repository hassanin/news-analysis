The House Republicans have released a tax-cut plan that aims to boost the economy and provide relief for businesses and the middle class. The plan aims to prevent businesses from moving operations overseas and increase business investment, leading to job creation and higher wages. It also includes tax cuts for middle-income taxpayers, with the lowest bracket having a higher upper limit than the current brackets. The goal is to pass this tax plan by the end of the year, which President Trump calls a "big, beautiful Christmas present."
