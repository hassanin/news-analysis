The President's Commission on White House Fellows has announced the appointment of the 2023-2024 class of White House Fellows. The program, founded in 1964, offers young leaders the opportunity to work at the highest levels of the Federal government. Fellows spend a year working with senior White House Staff, Cabinet Secretaries, and other top-ranking officials, and leave equipped to be better leaders in their communities. This year's Fellows come from diverse backgrounds and professions, including the private sector, local government, academia, non-profits, medicine, and the armed forces. Applications for the 2024-2025 Fellowship year will be accepted starting November 1, 2023.
