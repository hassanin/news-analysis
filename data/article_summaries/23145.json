The Obama Administration has released nearly 300 sets of data online as part of its commitment to transparency and public participation in government. This move aims to break down barriers between the federal government and the American people. Each major government department and agency has uploaded information to Data.gov in accordance with the Administration's Open Government Directive. The data includes information on child safety seats and physician services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries. The next step in the Open Government Directive is for each agency to create a website to serve as a gateway for open government activities, with a deadline of February 6, 2010. Additionally, an open government dashboard will be launched to track agencies' progress in increasing transparency and public participation.
