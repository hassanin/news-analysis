Second Lady Karen Pence participated in a call hosted by PREVENTS, in partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs Center for Faith and Opportunity Initiative (CFOI) and the National Chaplain Center, to discuss the role of faith-based communities and organizations in ending veteran suicide. As the Lead Ambassador for PREVENTS, Mrs. Pence highlighted the importance of suicide prevention and the need to support veterans experiencing suicidal thoughts. She also emphasized the protective factor of an individual's connection to a faith-based community. Pastors and religious leaders were recognized for their critical role in fostering purpose, connectivity, relationships, and a sense of belonging for veterans. Adherence to religious beliefs has been associated with lower suicide rates and lower rates of suicide attempts. PREVENTS recently launched a national health campaign called REACH to empower veterans and all Americans to prevent suicide. The overall suicide rate for veterans is 1.5 times higher than the national average.
