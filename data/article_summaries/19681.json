The article is a notice from the White House stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to Côte d'Ivoire. The President declared a national emergency in 2006 due to the threat to national security and foreign policy caused by the situation in Côte d'Ivoire. The ongoing conflict has resulted in the massacre of civilians, human rights abuses, political violence, and attacks against international peacekeeping forces. Despite progress made by the government and people of Côte d'Ivoire, the situation still poses a threat to the US. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2006 will continue for another year.
