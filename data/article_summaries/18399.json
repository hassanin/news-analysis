The White House Press Secretary has issued a statement expressing horror at the recent reports of massacres in South Sudan. Fighters aligned with rebel leader Riek Machar are said to have killed hundreds of innocent civilians in Bentiu. The attacks included murders at a hospital, a mosque, and on the streets and at a church, apparently motivated by ethnicity and nationality. Hate speech was also reportedly broadcast on local radio. The bodies have been buried in mass graves and the number of people seeking protection at a UN camp has significantly increased. The statement also condemns an armed attack at a UN Mission site in Bor, which resulted in the deaths of at least 48 civilians. The Press Secretary emphasizes that these acts of violence are a betrayal of the trust the South Sudanese people have placed in their leaders. Both President Kiir and Riek Machar are urged to condemn attacks on civilians, bring perpetrators of violence to justice, and put an end to the cycle of violence that has plagued South Sudan for too long.
