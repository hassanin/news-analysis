The article discusses the AUKUS security partnership announced by Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States in September 2021. The partnership aims to promote a secure and stable Indo-Pacific region. The first major initiative of AUKUS is to support Australia in acquiring conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines. The three nations will work together to develop the SSN-AUKUS submarine based on the UK's next-generation design, incorporating cutting-edge US submarine technologies. Australia and the UK will operate the SSN-AUKUS as their future submarines and will begin building them in their domestic shipyards within this decade. The plan is designed to develop Australia's infrastructure, technical capabilities, industry, and human capital necessary for a sovereign fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. The partnership also emphasizes the highest nuclear non-proliferation standards and consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The implementation of AUKUS will require information sharing, technology cooperation, and strengthening of security regimes among the three nations. The article concludes by highlighting the shared commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.
