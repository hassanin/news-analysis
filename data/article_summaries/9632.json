In a statement by Senior Advisor for Recovery Act Implementation Ed DeSeve, it was announced that over 98 percent of Recovery Act recipients complied with the requirement to file reports on their spending in the fourth quarter of 2009. This marked a 76 percent reduction in non-filers compared to the previous quarter, which was attributed to the efforts of federal agencies in eliminating cases of non-filing. The list of the less than 2 percent of recipients who failed to file in the fourth quarter has been delivered to the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. While pleased with the increased compliance, the government is still working towards achieving 100 percent participation and is urging federal agencies and the Recovery Board to develop penalties for those who fail to comply.
