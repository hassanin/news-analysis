On February 11, 2009, President Barack Obama signed a bill, S.352, which postponed the DTV transition date to June 12th. The purpose of this extension was to provide more time for American consumers to prepare for the switch from analog television to digital television. The President emphasized that, during challenging economic times, the needs of American consumers are a top priority. The bipartisan bill passed overwhelmingly in the House and Senate, ensuring that citizens would have sufficient time to prepare for the conversion. The President acknowledged that millions of Americans, especially those in vulnerable communities, would have been left without access to television if the conversion had proceeded as planned. This extension was seen as an important step in getting the nation ready for digital TV, and the administration pledged to work with Congress, broadcasters, consumer groups, and the telecommunications industry to improve information and assistance available to citizens before June 12th.
