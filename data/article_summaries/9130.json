The Biden Administration has announced a series of actions aimed at reducing the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are potent greenhouse gases found in various appliances and substances. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will release a new rule, along with other interagency actions, to phase down the production and consumption of HFCs by 85% below baseline levels within the next 15 years. These actions are expected to result in reductions of over 4.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2050. The United States is already a leader in innovation and manufacturing of HFC alternatives, and these actions will ensure that American industries remain competitive in the global market. The EPA's rule establishes an allowance allocation and trading program to reduce HFCs and creates a compliance and enforcement system. Additionally, the administration is taking coordinated steps across various agencies to prevent illegal trade, support the development and use of HFC alternatives, manage HFC stocks, and advance innovation and testing. The cumulative benefits of these actions are estimated to be over $272 billion through 2050 and will benefit vulnerable populations and save industry compliance costs.
