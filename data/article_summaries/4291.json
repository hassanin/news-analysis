Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, held a roundtable discussion with state legislators from Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma to discuss their efforts to protect access to reproductive health care. The legislators shared information about abortion restrictions in their states and steps they have taken to oppose new legislative proposals. The participants emphasized the negative impact these bills would have on access to reproductive health care services, particularly for low-income populations and those in rural communities. The senior administration officials expressed support for reproductive rights and pledged to protect access to health care. The discussion highlighted the numerous restrictive and unconstitutional measures that have been passed or are pending in states nationwide. The administration officials reaffirmed President Biden's commitment to uphold the constitutional right established in Roe v. Wade and his dedication to safeguard women's access to essential reproductive health care.
