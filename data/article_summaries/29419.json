During a press briefing, Chairman Hassett discussed the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on the US economy. He stated that the TCJA has had a positive impact on the economy, with increased capital formation and productivity leading to higher wages. He cited statistics such as increased business plans for hiring, higher employment rates, and wage growth for workers at the bottom of the income distribution. Chairman Hassett also discussed the success of the Opportunity Zones program, which provides tax benefits to investors in distressed communities. He mentioned that early evidence shows wage growth and property value appreciation in these zones. When asked about the impact on the deficit and whether additional tax cuts are planned, Chairman Hassett stated that the TCJA has already paid for itself on the corporate side, while the impact on individual taxes is less clear. He mentioned the potential for continued economic growth and increased revenue over the long term. When questioned about the unpopularity of the tax cuts, he emphasized the positive sentiment towards the economy and the direct benefits experienced by the majority of Americans. Finally, Chairman Hassett acknowledged the various factors that may have contributed to economic growth, but highlighted that the data aligns with the predictions made by economic models regarding the impact of the TCJA.
