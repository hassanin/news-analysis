The United States is taking additional actions to support Ukraine and hold Russia accountable for its invasion. The Department of Defense announced a new security assistance package for Ukraine, which includes unmanned aerial systems, counter-unmanned aerial systems equipment, electronic warfare detection equipment, ammunition, mine-clearing equipment, and secure communications support equipment. The United States is also disbursing $9.9 billion in grant financing to help Ukraine meet the critical needs of its citizens. In terms of energy infrastructure, the United States is delivering electrical transmission grid equipment and plans to provide additional emergency energy assistance to Ukraine. The United States, along with G7 partners, is imposing extensive sanctions on Russia's economy, targeting over 200 individuals and entities supporting Russia's war effort. Export controls will be implemented, restricting the purchase of certain items by targeted companies, and tariffs on Russian products imported to the United States will be raised. The United States is committed to holding those responsible for Russia's attacks and atrocities accountable and is working with allies to build support at the United Nations for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine.
