This article announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Burma. The President, in 1997, declared a national emergency due to the large-scale repression of the democratic opposition by the Government of Burma. The actions and policies of the Burmese government continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 1997, along with the measures adopted to address it, will continue for another year.
