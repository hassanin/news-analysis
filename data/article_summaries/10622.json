In this press gaggle, Press Secretary Jay Carney, Federal Controller of OMB Danny Werfel, and Principal Deputy Director of NEC Jason Furman discuss the potential impact of the sequester if it is allowed to take effect. They emphasize that the sequester is a blunt and indiscriminate instrument that poses a serious threat to national security, domestic priorities, and the economy. They argue that the sequester would cause significant disruptions and cuts in various government programs, leading to job losses and harm to critical services. They also state that the sequester is not a responsible way to achieve deficit reduction and call for a balanced approach to further deficit reduction that includes revenue increases and spending cuts. They stress the need for Congress to act swiftly to avoid the sequester and pursue a broader budget that achieves deficit reduction in a more balanced way.
