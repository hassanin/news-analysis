The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a fact sheet on U.S. government efforts to address bias-motivated violence against the LGBT community worldwide. The Obama Administration is committed to promoting the human rights of LGBT persons and combating hate crimes and bias-motivated violence. The U.S. government works with foreign law enforcement partners to provide training on LGBT issues and combat hate crimes. The State Department supports civil society, law enforcement, lawyers, and judges to promote and protect the rights of LGBT persons. The Department of Justice works with governments to develop police agency policies and police accountability. The U.S. also supports civil society organizations through the Global Equality Fund and the International Visitor Leadership Program. Next steps include launching a new initiative to provide technical assistance and support to civil society organizations and government, expanding training programs, facilitating a professional exchange project, and continuing coordination and engagement with civil society organizations and like-minded governments.
