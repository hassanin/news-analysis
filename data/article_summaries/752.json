The Biden-Harris Administration is proposing a significant investment in America's housing infrastructure to address the challenges of affordable, safe, energy-efficient, and resilient housing. This plan includes $213 billion in direct funding and over $100 billion in new and expanded tax credits, along with incentives for zoning reform. The goal is to build and modernize housing, producing, preserving, and retrofitting more than two million affordable and sustainable homes, including 500,000 new and rehabilitated homes for low- and moderate-income homebuyers and homeowners. These investments would also create hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, with a focus on providing opportunities for workers of color and residents of assisted housing. The plan aims to ensure that stable, affordable housing is accessible to all working families, serving as a foundation for their lives and their children's future.
