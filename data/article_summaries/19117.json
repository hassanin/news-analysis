President Obama is set to deliver a major speech on the financial crisis on September 14, 2009, at Federal Hall in New York City. The speech will mark the one-year anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered a global financial crisis. President Obama will discuss the steps taken by his administration to revive the economy, the plan to reduce the government's role in the financial sector, and the measures needed to prevent future crises. The event will be covered by media, but space is limited, and not all credentialing requests can be accommodated.
