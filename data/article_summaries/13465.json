The article discusses the action plan for the Nuclear Security Summit 2016 in support of the United Nations (UN). The UN plays a significant role in strengthening nuclear security globally through its General Assembly and Security Council. UN Security Council Resolution 1540 and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism are important legal foundations for combating nuclear terrorism. The action plan includes national implementation of nuclear security obligations, submission of voluntary reports on implementation, and support for the 1540 Committee and its Group of Experts. It also emphasizes the need to implement nuclear security-related commitments and obligations of relevant UN resolutions. The plan calls for assistance to be provided to states upon request, including support in implementing UNSCR 1540, ICSANT, and relevant UN resolutions. It highlights the importance of sharing information on effective practices and providing resources to the UN Trust Fund for Global and Regional Disarmament Affairs. The plan also emphasizes coordination and cooperation among states, the UN, and other relevant organizations, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and INTERPOL. Outreach efforts are proposed to promote the obligations of UNSCR 1540 and ICSANT, encourage ratification, and highlight the outcomes of the Nuclear Security Summits.
