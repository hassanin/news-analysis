President Biden has signed two executive orders aimed at combating transnational organized crime and illicit drugs. The first executive order establishes the U.S. Council on Transnational Organized Crime (USCTOC), which brings together key departments and agencies involved in counter-transnational organized crime efforts. The USCTOC will coordinate government-wide efforts to address transnational organized crime and enhance the Threat Mitigation Working Group. The second executive order imposes sanctions on foreign individuals and entities involved in the global illicit drug trade. The Department of the Treasury will designate 25 targets, including 10 individuals and 15 entities, contributing to the international proliferation of illicit drugs. The U.S. Government aims to modernize and expand its capabilities to target drug trafficking organizations, their enablers, and financial facilitators. The executive orders are part of the Biden Administration's efforts to address the drug overdose epidemic and substance use disorders.
