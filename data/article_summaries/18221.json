The White House Communications Director, Dan Pfeiffer, released a statement expressing the Obama Administration's satisfaction with the Supreme Court's decision to hear legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act. Pfeiffer highlighted the positive impact of the Act, such as providing health insurance to one million more young Americans, ensuring women have access to mammograms and preventive services without additional costs, and requiring insurance companies to allocate more premiums towards healthcare rather than advertising and bonuses. Pfeiffer expressed confidence in the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act and expected the Supreme Court to agree.
