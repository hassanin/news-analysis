The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced 42 new grants for its Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program, bringing the total number of grants awarded with Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 funds to 719. The DFC Program provides grants to community-based coalitions to strengthen partnerships and reduce youth substance use. These coalitions employ a variety of strategies to address local substance use problems. The Trump Administration sees stopping substance use among youth as a critical part of its approach to tackling the drug crisis, and the DFC Program has been successful in reducing youth substance use rates in communities. The additional grants announced today, combined with those announced in October, represent a federal investment of approximately $24 million.
