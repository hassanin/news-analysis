The White House has announced that the United States will host the first U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, DC on August 5 and 6, 2014. The summit aims to strengthen ties with Africa, focusing on trade, investment, security, democratic development, and the well-being of the African people. This event will build on the progress made since President Obama's trip to Africa the previous summer.
