President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. has declared a major disaster in the State of New Mexico due to wildfires and straight-line winds. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in certain counties, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. Federal funding is also available for emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation measures. Sandra L. Eslinger has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing in other areas, and additional counties may receive assistance after assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free phone numbers will operate seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time.
