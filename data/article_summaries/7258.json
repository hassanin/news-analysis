In this conversation, Vice President Kamala Harris discusses the challenges faced by the middle generation in America who are raising their children while also taking care of their aging parents. She emphasizes the immense physical, emotional, and financial demands placed on these individuals and highlights the diverse skills required for caregiving. Harris mentions the sacrifices made by working women who often have to leave their jobs to fulfill these responsibilities. She explains that the Build Back Better agenda aims to support parents and caregivers by providing resources for childcare and eldercare. The goal is to enable families to function effectively and give seniors the ability to age in their own homes with dignity. Harris emphasizes that this approach is not only the right thing to do but also cost-effective compared to assisted living facilities. The conversation concludes with gratitude for the opportunity to discuss these issues and a recognition of the urgency in addressing the challenges faced by caregivers.
