The White House has launched Ethics.gov, a website that centralizes and makes accessible various government databases in an effort to promote transparency and accountability. The website allows users to access and search records from seven different databases, including White House Visitor Records, Office of Government Ethics Travel Reports, Lobbying Disclosure Act Data, and Federal Election Commission Reports. This measure of government-verified data has never been available in such a centralized and user-friendly format. The launch of Ethics.gov is part of President Obama's commitment to creating an open and transparent government. Since taking office, President Obama has made efforts to increase public access to government information, track the use of federal dollars, and introduce initiatives for public engagement. The President also challenged other nations to make their governments more open and accountable, leading to the launch of the Open Government Partnership. The United States has implemented the U.S. National Action Plan on Open Government as part of this initiative.
