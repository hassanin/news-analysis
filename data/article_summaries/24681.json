Congressman Xavier Becerra, Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus and member of the President's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, supports President Obama's speech on a framework for shared prosperity and shared responsibility. Becerra emphasizes the need to responsibly reduce the deficit through shared sacrifice, rather than burdening seniors and working families alone. He highlights tax breaks and loopholes for millionaires and big corporations, wars funded on credit, and deregulation policies as the main causes of today's deficits. Becerra urges House Republicans to acknowledge these past policies and make difficult choices to get the country back on track.
