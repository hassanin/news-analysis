President Trump signed the America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 into law, authorizing water infrastructure projects that benefit almost every state in the country. The bill provides funding and tools to enhance coastal ports, reduce flood risks, restore ecosystems, upgrade dams and irrigation systems, and improve drinking water treatment and delivery. The legislation also extends the requirement for projects supported by the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund to use construction materials made in the USA. The President emphasized the importance of rebuilding America's infrastructure and expressed a desire for bipartisan cooperation on future infrastructure projects.
