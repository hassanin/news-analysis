This Presidential Memorandum, issued on December 30, 2020, extends a previous memorandum on visa sanctions. The original memorandum, signed on April 10, 2020, stated that countries that refuse or unreasonably delay accepting their citizens, subjects, nationals, or residents from the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic pose public health risks for Americans. The memorandum determined that the US must be able to repatriate foreign nationals who violate US laws. Due to the ongoing pandemic and the continued public health risk, section 3(d) of the April 10, 2020, Memorandum on Visa Sanctions is amended to state that the memorandum will continue in force until terminated by the President. The Secretaries of State, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security may submit a joint recommendation for termination based on US foreign policy interests and public health risks. The memorandum includes general provisions to ensure it is implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It also clarifies that it does not create any rights or benefits enforceable against the United States or its entities.
