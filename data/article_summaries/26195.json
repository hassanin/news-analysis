The United States has expressed concern over the Houthis' recent attack on a commercial vessel in the Bab al-Mandab, a busy shipping lane in Yemen. This attack comes after the Houthis threatened to target international maritime traffic in the Red Sea. The US is particularly worried because a significant amount of global trade, including energy and food supplies, passes through this area. The attack also coincided with a UN event where the Saudi-led Coalition pledged $930 million for Yemen. The US accuses the Iranian regime of perpetuating the conflict and supplying the Houthis with destabilizing weapons. The US is urging the Houthis to halt further escalation and engage in constructive dialogue to demonstrate their commitment to peace.
