The Obama Administration has announced new initiatives to help create jobs for veterans. One of the initiatives is to align accreditation requirements for nursing programs with medic training so that military medics can receive academic credit for their service. The Administration is also giving priority to nurse training programs that serve veterans when awarding grants. Additionally, the Administration has challenged Community Health Centers to hire 8,000 veterans over the next three years and will ask centers to start reporting on the number of veterans they employ. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has pledged to open up career paths beyond nursing and expand opportunities for veterans to become physician assistants. The Administration will identify model programs that offer expedited curricula for veterans and provide technical assistance to institutions with active veteran programs. These initiatives build on the President's commitment to create a 21st century health care workforce and his efforts to create jobs for veterans.
