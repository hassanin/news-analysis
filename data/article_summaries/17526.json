The article discusses the update of the U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer Policy. The policy was last updated in 1995 and has now been revised to align with current national security and foreign policy objectives. The new policy emphasizes the importance of factors such as human rights, international stability, homeland security, counter-terrorism, combatting transnational organized crime, and supporting nonproliferation. It also includes not only the transfer of arms but also related services and technical data. The update aims to provide greater clarity and transparency in U.S. arms transfer decisions and reaffirms the country's commitment to responsible and transparent arms transfers.
