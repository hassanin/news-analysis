President Biden is hosting the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health to address food insecurity and diet-related diseases. The conference aims to lay out a vision for ending hunger and reducing diet-related diseases by 2030, while also addressing disparities among affected communities. The White House launched a nationwide call to action and received over $8 billion in commitments, including investments in start-up companies and philanthropy to improve access to nutritious food and promote healthy choices. The White House announces new actions in the areas of food access, nutrition and health integration, consumer empowerment, physical activity support, and nutrition and food security research. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to working with leaders from various sectors to achieve these goals by 2030.
