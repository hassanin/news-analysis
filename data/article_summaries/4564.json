In a teleconference, a senior administration official discussed Russia's recognition of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics in Ukraine. The official stated that President Biden has issued an executive order prohibiting new investment, trade, and financing to and from these regions. The U.S. will also impose sanctions on any person operating in those areas. The official emphasized that these measures are in response to Russia's recognition and not the severe economic measures that the U.S. and its allies have been preparing for a potential invasion of Ukraine. The official also criticized President Putin's speech, stating that it was an attack on Ukraine's sovereignty and an attempt to justify a war. The official expressed concern about Russia's escalating actions in and around Ukraine, including troop movements and false-flag events. The U.S. will continue to consult with allies and partners on diplomatic solutions and potential consequences for Russia. The official mentioned that a proposed Biden-Putin summit would be contingent on Russia not taking further military action in Ukraine. The U.S. is closely monitoring the situation and will respond accordingly to Russian actions.
