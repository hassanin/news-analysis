President Obama is scheduled to visit Marquette, Michigan on February 10 to discuss the National Wireless Initiative. The initiative aims to extend wireless coverage to 98% of the population, with Marquette serving as an example of how broadband access has helped local businesses grow and export goods to new markets. The President's plan for a 21st-century infrastructure includes rebuilding roads, rails, and runways, as well as attracting new businesses and improving transportation and communication systems.
