The White House is requesting the Senate's advice and consent to ratify an Extradition Treaty between the United States and the Dominican Republic. The treaty, signed in January 2015, aims to replace an outdated extradition treaty from 1909. The new treaty adopts a modern "dual criminality" approach, allowing extradition for offenses like money laundering that were not previously included. It also includes a updated "political offense" clause and ensures that extradition cannot be refused based on nationality. The treaty also includes procedural improvements to streamline and expedite the extradition process. President Barack Obama recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the treaty and provide its consent for ratification.
