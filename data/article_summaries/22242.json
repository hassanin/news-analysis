The article discusses the anniversary of the Equal Pay Act, signed into law in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy, which aimed to end wage discrimination based on gender. However, despite the passage of time, pay parity between men and women is still far from reality, with women in the United States earning only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. This gap is even wider for women of color. The article argues that pay inequality is unacceptable and hampers the economy's ability to recover. The article highlights some steps taken to address this issue, such as the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, increased funding for enforcing equal pay laws, and the creation of the National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force. However, the article emphasizes that more needs to be done, calling for the modernization and strengthening of the Equal Pay Act, closing loopholes, providing incentives for compliance, and prohibiting certain types of retaliation against workers by employers. The article concludes by urging renewed efforts to address this ongoing issue.
