The G-7 leaders, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, released a statement on the situation in Ukraine. They welcomed the "Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements" adopted by the original signatories on February 12, 2015. The implementation of this package offers a way forward to a comprehensive, sustainable, and peaceful resolution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine. However, the G-7 remains concerned about the fighting around Debaltseve, where Russian-backed separatist militias are operating beyond the agreed-upon line of contact, causing civilian casualties. The G-7 urges all sides to adhere strictly to the provisions of the package and to carry out its measures without delay, starting with a ceasefire on February 15. The G-7 also condemns Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and welcomes the agreement reached between the IMF and the government of Ukraine on a new economic reform program. They are providing financial assistance to support Ukraine in its economic reforms and commend the government for its commitment to implementing these reforms.
