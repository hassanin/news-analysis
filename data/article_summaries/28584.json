President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order to address the national emergency regarding significant malicious cyber-enabled activities. The order aims to close a security loophole in United States Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products that has been exploited by foreign malicious cyber actors. These actors pose a threat to the economy and national security by stealing intellectual property, sensitive data, and targeting critical infrastructure. By reducing their access to and ability to use US ICTS products, the order aims to prevent these actors from using American innovation for nefarious purposes. The President's action is seen as a significant step in protecting the country from cyber attacks.
