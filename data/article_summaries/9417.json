The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a fact sheet on fulfilling leaders' instructions on quality in higher education. The APEC region and world faced a financial crisis, which led APEC Leaders to emphasize the importance of education and training as part of APEC's inclusive growth strategy. APEC has since focused on access to quality higher education and the role of cross-border education mobility in regional economic integration. APEC Leaders recognized that increasing cross-border student flows strengthens regional ties and promotes economic development. Last year, APEC Leaders introduced a new Framework of Connectivity, which included postsecondary cross-border education as a major part of the people-to-people connectivity agenda. They set a target of 1 million intra-APEC university-level students by 2020. To support this agenda, the United States has been advancing initiatives in cooperation with APEC economies, including the APEC Scholarships and Internships Initiative. This initiative aims to expand education and training opportunities for students and professionals by providing APEC-branded scholarship and internship opportunities. The United States and other APEC members are partnering with companies and universities to offer over 150 scholarships and internships. The United States also provides support for student and scholar exchange through the Fulbright Program and offers EducationUSA advisory services for students seeking information about studying in the United States. In support of APEC's student mobility target, the United States and Australia launched a five-year project called the APEC Education Mobility Data Collection Survey and Report. This project aims to collect data on education mobility in APEC economies to establish a baseline and identify gaps and opportunities for promoting regional educational exchanges.
