In a recent address via teleconference, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires in the United States, particularly in the Western states. She emphasized that the climate crisis is a significant factor contributing to the rise in wildfires, with extreme heat and drought making it easier for fires to start and spread. Harris mentioned the release of the United Nations' newest climate report, which highlights the urgent need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. She stressed that although the situation is dire, there are solutions available and action needs to be taken quickly. Harris called for a shift in focus from wildfire response to prevention, investing in preparedness and resilience measures. She announced a $197 million investment in 100 communities across the nation through the new Community Wildfire Defense Grants program, which aims to provide resources for protecting communities from wildfires. The grants will fund initiatives such as evacuation planning, community education, and clearing flammable brush. Harris mentioned specific examples of grants being awarded in Arizona, North Carolina, and California. She also highlighted the importance of using cutting-edge technology, such as satellite imagery, to predict and monitor wildfires. Harris concluded by stating that the investments made so far are just a down payment, and the administration will continue to prioritize the safety of families, communities, and firefighters. Secretary Tom Vilsack, who has been a champion for rural communities and working families, followed Harris's remarks.
