The article announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to weapons of mass destruction. The President initially declared the emergency in 1994 due to the threat posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Over the years, the President has issued amendments to enhance the response to this threat. The proliferation of these weapons and their means of delivery still poses a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency, which has been extended each year, will continue for another year. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, and the notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress. The statement is signed by President Barack Obama.
