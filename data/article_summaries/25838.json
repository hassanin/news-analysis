President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring September 2018 as National Preparedness Month. This month is dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of preparing families, homes, businesses, and communities for disasters that may occur. The proclamation also acknowledges and honors the first responders who selflessly provide aid during crises and disasters. The past year has seen numerous natural disasters, including hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, floods, and volcanic eruptions, affecting millions of people. The proclamation emphasizes that preparedness is a shared responsibility and encourages all Americans to develop and practice emergency response plans, assemble disaster supply kits, sign up for alerts on mobile devices, set aside emergency savings, and maintain adequate insurance. By taking these steps, individuals can help protect their communities and save lives.
