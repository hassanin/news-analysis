During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced that the United States is purchasing an additional 500 million Pfizer vaccines to donate to low- and lower-middle income countries. This brings the total number of vaccine doses donated by the United States to over 1.1 billion. Psaki emphasized that the donations come with no strings attached and that the United States has delivered more free doses than any other country in the world. She also mentioned that the United States is committed to working with the European Union to enhance vaccination rates globally. Psaki also addressed questions about the situation at the border, the recent phone call between President Biden and French President Macron, the status of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, and the President's upcoming meetings with Democratic lawmakers on his economic plan.
