President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed October 9th to October 15th as Fire Prevention Week in the United States. This annual observance aims to raise awareness about fire safety and preparedness and to prevent fires in homes, schools, workplaces, and the outdoors. The president acknowledges the bravery and heroism of firefighters who risk their lives to protect communities. He also highlights the devastating impact of recent wildfires, fueled by the climate crisis, which have destroyed homes, businesses, and natural resources. The administration is investing billions in forest management and measures to mitigate wildfire risk. Efforts include protecting mature and old-growth forests, increasing wages for federal wildland firefighters, and supporting their mental and physical health. Additionally, the government has allocated funds to help states and communities fight wildfires and enhance resilience. The president emphasizes the importance of fire safety education, including developing fire escape plans, regularly testing alarms, implementing building codes, and clearing vegetation around homes in fire-prone areas. The proclamation calls on all Americans to participate in Fire Prevention Week and renew their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.
