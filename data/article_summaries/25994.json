The US government has released a National Biodefense Strategy and signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM) to enhance the country's defenses against biological threats. The strategy builds on lessons learned from past incidents, such as the anthrax attacks in 2001 and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014, to create a more resilient and effective biodefense enterprise. The NSPM establishes a Cabinet-level Biodefense Steering Committee to support the transformation of America's biodefense and directs the National Security Advisor to annually review and prioritize biodefense actions. The strategy aims to address all types of biological threats, whether they are naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental. The government will continuously evaluate its biodefense needs and monitor the implementation of the strategy to effectively allocate resources. The move underscores the administration's commitment to protecting the American people, homeland, and way of life from all forms of threats.
