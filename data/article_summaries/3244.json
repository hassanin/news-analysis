The Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a strengthened approach to disrupt the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and its precursors into American communities. Illicit synthetic opioids like fentanyl are now the drugs most responsible for overdose deaths in the United States. These drugs are easier to produce and transport, making them a significant threat to national security, public safety, and public health.

The administration has prioritized an evidence-based strategy to address addiction, prevent drug deaths, and dismantle drug trafficking networks. They have expanded access to prevention, treatment, and recovery services, collaborated with state and local partners, invested in law enforcement efforts, and enabled seizures of illicit fentanyl at the border. These actions have contributed to a decrease in overdose deaths.

To further reduce the supply of illicit drugs, the administration is cracking down on illicit fentanyl supply chains. They are implementing measures such as enhancing international cooperation, targeting financial networks, increasing inspections of mail and express consignment facilities, and expanding efforts to detect and intercept illicit drugs.

Additionally, the administration is accelerating public health initiatives to save lives. This includes expanding access to naloxone, a medication used to reverse opioid overdoses, and supporting community-based initiatives to prevent and respond to overdoses.

President Biden has called on Congress to make a historic investment of $46.1 billion for National Drug Control Program agencies to support these efforts. The budget includes funding to reduce the supply of illicit drugs, as well as to expand prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support services.
