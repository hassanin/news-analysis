The United States has announced that it now has less than 50,000 troops in Iraq, meeting the goal set by President Obama to responsibly draw down forces from Iraq and transition security responsibility to Iraqi security forces. The announcement comes ahead of the planned shift in the U.S. mission in Iraq from combat to support of Iraqi security forces. After September 1st, the U.S. mission will be advising and assisting Iraqi security forces, conducting counterterrorism operations, and protecting remaining U.S. troops and civilians in Iraq. The drawdown demonstrates the capability of the Iraqi security forces, who have increasingly taken the lead in providing security for the country. However, terrorist groups, primarily al Qaeda in Iraq, continue to carry out acts of violence, although at a reduced level. The U.S. will continue to partner with those who oppose terrorism, extremism, and violence in Africa, particularly in the Horn of Africa in Somalia. The administration is also reviewing the recent court decision on stem cell research and exploring all possibilities to continue critical research. The President is focused on the economy and is doing everything possible to move it in the right direction. He is also closely monitoring the housing market and working to help small businesses. The President will be making a speech on the importance of the milestone in Iraq and will address the bravery of American soldiers, the future policy in Iraq, and its relation to the fight against al Qaeda in Afghanistan and worldwide. The President is on vacation and enjoying time with his family, playing board games, watching movies, and reading books. He is also staying updated on the primaries and continuing to focus on the economy.
