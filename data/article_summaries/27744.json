The White House has released a report titled "Implementing the Global Health Security Agenda: Progress and Impact from U.S. Government Investments," which shows that investments made by taxpayers to improve global health security are yielding positive results. The Trump Administration has been actively promoting the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), which aims to enhance health security capabilities worldwide in order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The report highlights how GHSA support has enabled countries to effectively respond to and contain outbreaks of diseases such as dengue fever in Burkina Faso and the Marburg virus in Uganda. The United States Government remains committed to the GHSA and is proposing additional resources for the program in the Fiscal Year 2019 President's Budget. The budget also emphasizes the importance of strengthening countries' ability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats.
