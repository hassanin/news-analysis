Yesterday, the White House Gender Policy Council and the White House Office of Public Engagement held a meeting with Disabled leaders to discuss the intersection of disability rights and access to reproductive health care. The participants emphasized the importance of bodily autonomy, self-determination, and health equity, including culturally competent care. They highlighted the potential disproportionate impact on Americans with disabilities if Roe v Wade, the landmark abortion rights case, is overturned. Barriers such as lack of accessible facilities and transportation were also discussed. The right to parent was recognized as a disability rights issue, and participants emphasized the need for services that support disabled individuals in parenting to their fullest capability. Advocates stressed the importance of mobilizing the Disabled community in support of reproductive freedom. White House officials acknowledged the participants as essential partners in protecting reproductive rights and invited them to continue the dialogue.
