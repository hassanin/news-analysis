During National Women's Health Week, the United States government is highlighting the importance of promoting and supporting the health and well-being of women. While progress has been made in women's health, there are still challenges to overcome. Heart disease and breast cancer mortality rates have decreased, but heart attacks still affect women every 100 seconds, with many women not calling 9-1-1 when experiencing symptoms. The government encourages everyone to be aware of heart attack warning signs and to seek help immediately. Additionally, efforts are being made to reduce pregnancy-related mortality and improve access to high-quality care. Surprise medical billing and price transparency are also areas of focus, as healthcare costs impact American families significantly. The government is committed to addressing the opioid crisis, with $6 billion in funding secured and proposals to provide postpartum Medicaid coverage for women with substance use disorders. The goal is to improve outcomes for mothers and infants. Overall, the government reiterates its commitment to improving women's health and ensuring their well-being.
