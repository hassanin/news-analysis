The United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands conducted strikes against Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen in response to their illegal attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. These strikes aimed to disrupt the Houthis' capability to continue their attacks on global trade and innocent mariners. The Houthis have launched over 30 attacks since mid-November, posing a threat to countries relying on international maritime shipping. The international community condemns these attacks and demands their end. Supplying weapons to the Houthis is deemed a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2216 and international law. The international response on January 22 demonstrated a shared commitment to upholding navigational rights and defending mariners from unjustifiable attacks.
