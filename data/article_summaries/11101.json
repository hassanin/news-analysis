President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 2010 as National Wilderness Month in the United States. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of preserving and protecting the nation's wilderness areas for future generations. He acknowledges the historical, cultural, and religious significance these sites hold for Native American tribes, who were the original stewards of the land. Obama highlights the rich history of conservation in America, including the signing of the Wilderness Act by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. He also mentions his own efforts to restore and protect wild spaces through the Omnibus Public Land Management Act and the America's Great Outdoors Initiative. The proclamation encourages all Americans to visit and enjoy the wilderness, learn about its history, and contribute to the protection of these natural treasures.
