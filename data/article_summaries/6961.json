President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Minnesota due to severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from May 29-30, 2022. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, as well as the repair or replacement of damaged facilities, on a cost-sharing basis. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding. Brian F. Schiller has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
