President Joe Biden has issued an executive order requiring COVID-19 vaccination for all federal employees, with exceptions only as required by law. The order is based on the policy of the administration to halt the spread of COVID-19, including the Delta variant, by relying on data and science-based public health measures. The order emphasizes the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing infection, severe illness, hospitalization, and death. It also acknowledges that federal employees play a crucial role in the efficiency of the civil service and that their health and safety, as well as the health and safety of those they interact with, are paramount. The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force has provided guidance on protecting the federal workforce, and agencies have taken actions, including requiring vaccination in some cases. The order directs each agency to implement a program to require COVID-19 vaccination for its employees, in accordance with applicable law. The order also includes definitions and general provisions, ensuring its implementation is consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
