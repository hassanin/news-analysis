President Biden is set to host South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to discuss shared priorities, including trade, investment, infrastructure, climate and energy, health, and regional and global challenges. The meeting follows a productive call in April and the U.S.-South Africa Strategic Dialogue in August. The U.S. has a strong relationship with South Africa, with 600 U.S. companies based there and $21 billion in U.S. foreign direct investment in 2021. The two leaders will also discuss the nuclear energy agreement, South Africa's electricity crisis, and the Countering Malign Russian Activities in Africa Act. The U.S. supports South Africa's Just Energy Transition and has committed $1 billion to assist. The meeting is expected to cover a range of issues, including the conflict in Ukraine and the U.S.-China relationship. The U.S. has been actively engaging with African countries, and President Biden or Vice President Harris may visit the continent in the future. The meeting between the two presidents will take place in the Oval Office, with short remarks and a press spray. The trade relationship between the U.S. and South Africa is of paramount importance, and efforts will be made to deepen and expand it.
