On December 23, 2011, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 2055, the "Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012." This bill provides the necessary funding for the smooth operation of the US government. However, the Department of Justice has advised that some provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns. The bill includes provisions that prohibit the use of funds for transferring Guantanamo detainees into the United States and for transferring them to foreign countries unless specific conditions are met. The President has objected to these provisions, stating that they could violate constitutional separation of powers principles. He intends to interpret and apply them in a way that avoids constitutional conflicts and promises to work towards their repeal.

The bill also includes provisions that could interfere with the President's constitutional authorities in foreign relations and national security. For example, it requires the Secretary of Defense to notify Congress before any military exercise involving US personnel with expenditures over $100,000 on construction. It also limits the expenditure of funds for United Nations peacekeeping missions involving US Armed Forces under the command of a foreign national unless it is deemed in the national interest. The President reiterates that he will apply these provisions in a manner consistent with his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief.

Certain provisions in the bill restrict or require specific diplomatic communications, negotiations, or interactions with foreign governments or international organizations. Others hinder the President's ability to receive diplomatic representatives of foreign governments. The President has informed Congress that he will not treat these provisions as limiting his constitutional authorities in foreign relations.

Additionally, some provisions in the bill could prevent the President from fulfilling his constitutional responsibilities by denying him the assistance of senior advisers and obstructing his supervision of executive branch officials. The President will interpret these provisions consistent with his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

Furthermore, there are provisions in the bill that purport to restrict the use of funds to advance certain legislative positions. The President has advised Congress that he will not construe these provisions as preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional responsibility to recommend necessary and expedient measures to Congress.

Lastly, the bill includes provisions that condition the authority of executive branch officials to spend or reallocate funds on the approval of congressional committees. The President considers these forms of congressional aggrandizement in the execution of laws to be constitutionally impermissible. While his administration will notify the relevant committees before taking specified actions and consider their recommendations seriously, spending decisions will not be dependent on the approval of congressional committees.

Overall, the President has expressed his concerns about the constitutional implications of certain provisions in H.R. 2055 but has signed the bill into law. He intends to interpret and apply these provisions in a way that avoids conflicts and continues to work towards their repeal.
