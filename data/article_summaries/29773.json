The Trump Administration's decision to bar Title X family planning funds from programs and facilities that perform abortions is receiving praise from editorial boards, pro-life leaders, and commentators. They believe that this move ensures that taxpayers do not fund the abortion industry in violation of the law. They argue that the change aligns with the original intent of Congress when it passed Title X and ends the misinterpretation that required recipient programs to refer women to abortionists. Supporters also believe that this decision promotes better healthcare alternatives for women and upholds the constitutional rights of taxpayers.
