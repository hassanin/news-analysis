During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney and Secretary of Labor Tom Perez discuss the President’s executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 an hour. The order will benefit hundreds of thousands of people and improve taxpayers’ return on their investment. However, they acknowledge that this is just a first step and that every American worker, not just federal contract employees, needs a raise. They are also pushing for the passage of the Harkin-Miller bill, which would increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for all workers.
