On September 29, 2022, the President signed the Civilian Reservist Emergency Workforce Act of 2021, also known as the CREW Act. This law provides employment protections to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reservists who are deployed to major disaster sites. The Act grants these reservists the same employment and reemployment rights as those provided by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act. The President expressed gratitude to Senators Peters and Portman, as well as Representatives Titus and Katko, among others, for their leadership in passing this legislation.
