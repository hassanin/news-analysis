The article discusses various provisions of an Act that purport to restrict the President's constitutional authority in different areas. Some provisions aim to limit the President's control over military personnel and resources, while others require advance notice to Congress before certain military actions can be taken. The Act also restricts transfers of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, but the President intends to keep the detention facility open and use it as necessary. Certain provisions of the Act could interfere with the President's authority to conduct diplomacy, but they will be treated in accordance with the President's constitutional powers in foreign relations. The Act also addresses medical marijuana laws, the supervision of work by executive departments and agencies, communications by executive branch employees, and the dissemination of information protected by executive privilege. Some provisions of the Act require recommendations to Congress, but they will be treated as advisory and non-binding. Lastly, the President opposes provisions that condition spending decisions on the approval of congressional committees, considering them as impermissible forms of congressional aggrandizement. The President will notify the relevant committees but will not treat spending decisions as dependent on their approval.
