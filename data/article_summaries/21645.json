On May 20, 2009, President Barack Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding a proposed nuclear agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The memorandum states that after considering the agreement and the input from relevant agencies, President Obama has determined that the agreement will promote the common defense and security and does not pose an unreasonable risk. As a result, he approves the proposed agreement and authorizes the Secretary of State to arrange for its execution. The Secretary of State is also instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
