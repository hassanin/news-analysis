In a press briefing, Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan discuss the announcement of the Excellent Educators for All Initiative. The initiative aims to ensure that states and districts have a good, quality teacher in every classroom. It includes asking states to submit comprehensive plans to ensure progress towards educator equity, launching the new Educator Equity Support Network to provide states and districts support in developing and implementing their plans, and publishing Educator Equity profiles to help states use data to identify gaps in access to high-quality teaching for low-income and minority students. Secretary Duncan emphasizes the importance of providing support to teachers and principals in high-need schools and involving them in the decision-making process. The article also mentions the NEA calling for Secretary Duncan's resignation, the issue of teacher tenure, and the relationship between the administration and teachers unions. In addition, the article briefly discusses the situation at the US-Mexico border, the need for Congress to address the Highway Trust Fund, and recent developments in Iraq.
