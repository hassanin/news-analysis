The United States military successfully conducted a rescue operation in Nigeria to save an American hostage who had been kidnapped just 96 hours earlier. The operation, carried out by United States Special Forces, was executed with skill, precision, and bravery, resulting in the safe recovery of the hostage. No US service members were harmed during the operation. The former hostage is currently in good health and has been reunited with his family. The rescue of Americans held captive abroad has been a top national security priority for the current administration, and this operation serves as a warning to terrorists and criminals who believe they can kidnap Americans without consequences. The administration has rescued over 55 hostages and detainees in more than 24 countries since taking office.
