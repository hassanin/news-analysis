The article discusses the announcement made by the European Union (EU) regarding new economic sanctions and other measures against Iran and Syria. The United States also recently increased its own sanctions on Iran and announced additional actions against Syrian officials and entities. These steps demonstrate the international community's determination to address the violation of the rights of the Syrian people by the Assad regime and the failure of the Iranian regime to meet its international obligations. The US applauds the EU's efforts and its willingness to consider further actions in the future. The US has been coordinating closely with the EU on both Syria and Iran and emphasizes the commitment of the United States and its European allies to work together on these shared challenges. The US looks forward to continued coordination with the EU and other concerned governments to increase pressure on Syria and Iran and put an end to their violations of international norms.
