President Obama has signed into law H.R. 3979, the "Carl Levin and Howard P. 'Buck' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015." The legislation provides benefits for military personnel and their families and gives authorities to counter the Islamic State and respond to emerging terrorist threats. The President highlights the closure of the U.S. detention operations in Afghanistan but criticizes the continued operation of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, stating that it weakens national security and damages relationships with allies. He calls on Congress to work with his administration to close the facility and expresses opposition to restrictions on detainee transfers. The President emphasizes that the executive branch should have flexibility in determining how to handle remaining detainees based on national security interests and the circumstances of each case. He warns that if the restrictions violate constitutional separation of powers, his administration will implement them in a way that avoids conflict. The President urges bipartisan cooperation to bring this chapter of American history to a close.
