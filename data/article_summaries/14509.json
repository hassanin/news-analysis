In September 2009, President Obama had a lunch with 25 African heads of state and the AU Commissioner. The purpose of the lunch was to foster a dialogue and build partnerships on topics such as job creation, trade and investment, and agricultural productivity. The President emphasized the importance of a prosperous and peaceful Africa and the need for Africans to be in the lead with the United States as strong partners. The lunch did not specifically address the conflict in Sudan, but corruption and women's issues were discussed. The President did not announce any specific plans for another visit to Africa. The AU Commissioner represented the African Union at the lunch, and there were no representatives from Libya or Somalia.
