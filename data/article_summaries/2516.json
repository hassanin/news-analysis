The United States is proud to announce that it will be hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in 2023. This decision demonstrates the country's commitment to promoting fair and open trade, enhancing American competitiveness, and ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. President Biden and Vice President Harris offered to host APEC next year to strengthen economic ties in the region. The Biden-Harris Administration aims to be a reliable partner to APEC economies and work together to unlock economic opportunities, prosperity, and growth. The US government, led by Secretary of Commerce Raimondo, United States Trade Representative Ambassador Tai, and their team, is collaborating with APEC partners to develop an Indo-Pacific economic framework that focuses on important issues such as trade facilitation, digital economy and technology standards, supply chain resilience, decarbonization and clean energy, infrastructure, and worker standards. Secretary of State Blinken is also engaging with key diplomatic relationships in the region to advance shared priorities. The United States looks forward to collaborating closely with Thailand (the 2022 APEC host), Peru (the 2024 APEC host), and all APEC economies to create an agenda that benefits all people involved.
