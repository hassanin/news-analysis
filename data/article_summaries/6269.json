Secretary Gina Raimondo announced the next steps that the Department of Commerce is taking to implement the $50 billion of CHIPS Act funding. The funding will be used to establish and expand domestic production of leading-edge semiconductors in the United States, build a sufficient and stable supply of mature node semiconductors, invest in research and development for the next generation of semiconductor technology, and create tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs. The Department of Commerce will evaluate applications for funding on a rolling basis and will implement strict guardrails to protect taxpayers and ensure national security. The funding is intended to revitalize U.S. innovation and research and development in the semiconductor industry and strengthen America's economic competitiveness.
