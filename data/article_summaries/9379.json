The meeting held in Aqaba, Jordan, between senior officials of Israel, the Palestinian Authority (PA), Jordan, Egypt, and the United States is seen as a positive step towards de-escalating violence and working towards a just and lasting peace. The Aqaba Communiqu√©, resulting from the meeting, includes commitments by the Israeli government and the PA to prevent further violence and uphold previous agreements. The meeting is considered a starting point, and there is still much work to be done to ensure a stable and prosperous future for both Israelis and Palestinians. The President expresses gratitude to King Abdullah II of Jordan for convening the meeting and to President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi of Egypt for his efforts in making it successful. The United States will remain actively engaged in the process and will have a follow-up engagement in Egypt next month.
