This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama in 2013. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of promoting gender equality and empowering women and girls globally. It states that achieving gender equality is crucial for achieving foreign policy objectives, as it leads to economic prosperity, political stability, and security. The memorandum highlights the efforts made by the United States government to promote gender equality, including the establishment of the White House Council on Women and Girls and the development of various policies and strategies. To further strengthen these efforts, the memorandum directs the Secretary of State to designate a coordinator for gender equality and women's empowerment, who will lead the Office of Global Women's Issues. The coordinator will provide guidance and coordination on global policies and programs for women and girls, collaborate with other countries and organizations, and work closely with USAID. The memorandum also establishes an interagency working group to develop and implement policies promoting gender equality. The memorandum concludes by stating that it does not create any legally enforceable rights.
