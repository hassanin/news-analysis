President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Florida due to severe storms, flooding, tornadoes, and straight-line winds. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in Volusia County. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is conducting damage surveys in other areas, and more counties and assistance may be designated after assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.
