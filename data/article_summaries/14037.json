President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will be hosting a concert in the East Room of the White House to honor songwriters Burt Bacharach and Hal David, who will receive the 2012 Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. The concert is part of the "In Performance at the White House" series. Performers at the concert will include Sheryl Crow, Michael Feinstein, Diana Krall, Lyle Lovett, Mike Myers, Rumer, Arturo Sandoval, Shel√©a, and Stevie Wonder. The President's remarks will be available through pooled press, and the entire event will be streamed live on the White House website. The concert will also be broadcast on PBS stations nationwide and via the American Forces Network at a later date. This is the first time the Gershwin Prize has been awarded to a songwriting team, as Bacharach is a pianist and David is a lyricist. The concert is part of a two-day celebration of the recipients of the Gershwin Prize, with an invitation-only concert at the Library of Congress on May 8th. This concert will also feature performances by Sheryl Crow, Diana Krall, Mike Myers, Lyle Lovett, Rumer, and Stevie Wonder. This concert will be the ninth "In Performance at the White House" program hosted by the Obamas, which have previously honored Stevie Wonder, Sir Paul McCartney, Hispanic musical heritage, Black History Month, Broadway and the American musical, and Country Music.
