Yesterday, a virtual meeting was held between Erika Moritsugu, Deputy Assistant to the President, Sonal Shah, President of The Asian American Foundation, and AA and NHPI faith leaders at the White House. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss hate prevention and inclusion for Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) communities leading up to the 20th anniversary of 9/11. The Administration wanted to hear directly from local and national leaders about their efforts to combat anti-AA and NHPI hate, pursue racial justice, and promote belonging and inclusion. Attendees shared lessons learned over the past 20 years on preventing hate and bigotry and discussed effective strategies for healing communities affected by hate and violence. The importance of interfaith dialogue in bridging divides and countering xenophobic violence was also highlighted. The Administration reaffirmed its commitment to fighting hate, addressing racial equity gaps, and collaborating with the groups on initiatives such as the Afghan refugee resettlement. The Administration also pledged to continue engaging and partnering with these organizations. Some of the participating organizations included the Asian American Christian Collaborative, Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), Christians for Social Action, Claremont Theological Seminary, Emgage, Faith and Community Empowerment (FACE), Interfaith Youth Core, Muhammad Ali Center, Muslim Advocates, National Association of Evangelicals, and Sikh Coalition.
