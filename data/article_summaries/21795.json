Vice President Joe Biden had a phone call with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko regarding the Malaysia Airlines disaster and the situation in eastern Ukraine. They discussed the need for an international investigation with unrestricted access to the crash site. They also agreed that Russia, as the party responsible for arming the separatists, should publicly call on them to lay down their weapons and allow investigators in. Biden emphasized Russia's obligations to support a ceasefire, peace talks, release of hostages, OSCE border monitoring, and to stop the flow of heavy weapons across the border.
