President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 1, 2009, as Law Day in the United States. Law Day is a day dedicated to celebrating and reaffirming the commitment to the rule of law. This year, the bicentennial of President Abraham Lincoln's birth is also being celebrated. Lincoln, known for his dedication to the rule of law and equality, played a significant role in guiding the nation through its most turbulent period. His legacy includes the Emancipation Proclamation, the preservation of the Union, and the Gettysburg Address. President Obama encourages Americans to reflect on Lincoln's vision of a "more perfect Union" and to continue the national conversation on the principles for which Lincoln stood. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to acknowledge the importance of the nation's legal and judicial systems through appropriate ceremonies and activities, and to display the flag in support of Law Day.
