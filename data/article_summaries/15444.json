The White House has issued a memorandum from President Barack Obama, extending Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Liberians residing in the United States. This extension is based on compelling foreign policy reasons and grants an 18-month deferral of removal for Liberian nationals or individuals without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia. The grant of DED applies to those who have continuously resided in the United States since October 1, 2002, with exceptions outlined in the memorandum. The memorandum also authorizes employment for the same 18-month period.
