On July 26, 2012, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 3001, is called the "Raoul Wallenberg Centennial Celebration Act." This bill awards a Congressional Gold Medal to Raoul Wallenberg for his achievements and heroic actions during the Holocaust. The second bill, S. 2009, is called the "Insular Areas Act of 2011." This bill amends the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003. It requires the Department of Energy to survey radiological conditions at Cactus Crater on Runit Island and delays the scheduled minimum wage increase in American Samoa.
