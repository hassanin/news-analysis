The Trump Administration has expressed deep concern over reports of the Iranian regime imprisoning thousands of Iranian citizens for participating in peaceful protests. There are also reports of torture and killings of demonstrators while in detention, which is even more troubling. The administration vows to not stay silent as the Iranian dictatorship violates the basic rights of its citizens and promises to hold Iran's leaders accountable for any violations. The protesters in Iran have legitimate grievances, including demanding an end to government oppression, corruption, and wasteful military spending. The United States is calling for the immediate release of all political prisoners in Iran, including those affected by the recent crackdown.
