Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx announced his support for a bipartisan measure to extend unemployment benefits and Bush era tax cuts. The proposal aims to promote job creation and economic growth. Foxx stated that the measure would give the economy more time to heal and prevent a federal income tax increase for working families for two years. The proposal includes a combination of payroll tax cuts, business investment tax cuts, and unemployment help. Foxx called on Congress to approve the measure without delay. The framework agreement also includes provisions such as the extension of income tax rates, growth-oriented payroll tax cuts, extension of unemployment benefits, and business tax cuts to increase investment and growth. The framework was announced by President Barack Obama and requires action by Congress to take effect.
