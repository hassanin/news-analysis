President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of California and ordered Federal aid to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by wildfires starting on November 8, 2018. Federal funding will be available to affected individuals in Butte, Los Angeles, and Ventura counties, which can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding will also be available to State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work in the affected counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for cost-sharing. David G. Samaniego has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are still ongoing in other areas, and additional areas may be designated for assistance after the assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance online or by calling the provided toll-free telephone numbers.
