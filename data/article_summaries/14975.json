On February 16, 2010, the President signed into law H.R. 730, the "Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act." This act establishes the National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and requires DHS to create a National Nuclear Forensics Expertise Development Program. The program will provide scholarships and fellowships to undergraduate and graduate students studying specialties relevant to nuclear forensics.
