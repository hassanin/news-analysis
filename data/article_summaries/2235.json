President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed April 2022 as National Cancer Control Month. Despite progress in preventing, detecting, and treating cancer over the past 50 years, it remains the second leading cause of death in the United States. President Biden aims to reduce the death rate from cancer by 50% over the next 25 years and improve the experience of those living with and surviving cancer. The Cancer Moonshot initiative has been reignited to accelerate progress against cancer by leveraging 21st century science and technology. The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) will be created to expedite breakthroughs in cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. The First Lady and President Biden have called for action on cancer screening and early detection to make up for screenings missed due to the pandemic. Americans are encouraged to take steps to lower their risk of cancer, such as reducing tobacco use, eating healthily, engaging in regular exercise, limiting alcohol consumption, and reducing sun exposure. Access to health coverage is critical, and efforts will be made to reduce prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums, and close the Medicaid coverage gap. The commitment and dedication of doctors, nurses, researchers, caregivers, and advocates in the fight against cancer are recognized and appreciated. The proclamation calls for increased awareness and activities to prevent, detect, treat, and control cancer.
