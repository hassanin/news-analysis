The White House recently held a meeting to discuss ways to improve the security of open source software. Open source software is widely used and has unique security challenges due to its broad usage and the number of volunteers responsible for its maintenance. The discussion focused on three main topics: preventing security defects and vulnerabilities in code, improving the process for finding and fixing defects, and shortening the response time for distributing and implementing fixes. Some ideas discussed included integrating security features into development tools, securing the infrastructure used to build and distribute code, and prioritizing important open source projects. The use of Software Bills of Material was also discussed to make it easier to know what is in the software we purchase and use. The meeting included representatives from government agencies and private sector organizations such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and the Linux Foundation. These discussions will continue in the coming weeks, and the initiatives are open to all interested stakeholders. President Biden has made software security a national priority, and his Executive Order on Cybersecurity requires companies that sell to the federal government to use secure software development practices.
