The United States has announced over $89 million in new humanitarian aid for Yemen, where escalating violence has left 80% of the population in need of urgent assistance. The funding will provide emergency food, water, sanitation, shelter, medical care, nutrition services, and protection for vulnerable populations. This brings the total US humanitarian assistance for Yemen to nearly $170 million in fiscal year 2015. The US remains the largest donor of food assistance to Yemen. The announcement comes as nearly 13 million people in Yemen are facing food shortages, and 1.8 million children are likely to suffer from malnutrition in 2015. The US assistance will be delivered through Yemen's sea and airports and distribution networks. The Saudi Arabian government has committed to allowing unfettered access to assistance and enabling the reopening of Yemen's Red Sea ports. The US supports efforts by the United Nations to de-escalate the conflict and urges all parties to participate in peace talks without preconditions.
