Each year, over 2 million poisoning cases are reported in the United States, with tens of thousands of children being treated for poisoning in emergency rooms. The trauma and recovery process for survivors and their families can be challenging. National Poison Prevention Week aims to raise awareness and encourage Americans to take precautions to keep their loved ones safe. Congress has been working for decades to protect Americans from poisonous household products, and President John F. Kennedy issued the first Presidential Proclamation on this issue in 1962. Most poisoning cases are accidental and preventable, often involving children ingesting medicines, batteries, household cleaning chemicals, hand sanitizers, or liquid nicotine from e-cigarettes. It is crucial to store harmful products in child-resistant packaging, dispose of unfinished medicines, and keep potential poisons out of the reach of children. A new law was signed to improve child-resistant closures on consumer products with small batteries. Additionally, clear labeling of medications or keeping them in their original packaging can help prevent dangerous mix-ups, especially among older Americans. Illegal synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, are also a significant concern, with over 107,000 Americans losing their lives to drug overdoses or poisonings in 2021. The National Drug Control Strategy aims to disrupt the supply of these opioids, expand access to naloxone, treatments, and recovery services, and invest in prevention. If someone suspects poisoning, they should immediately call the National Poison Control helpline at 800-222-1222 to be connected to a local poison control center. Trained experts can provide real-time assistance and often resolve poisoning emergencies over the phone. National Poison Prevention Week was authorized by a joint resolution of the United States Congress in 1961, designating the third week of March each year for raising awareness about unintentional poisonings. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. proclaims March 19 through March 25, 2023, as National Poison Prevention Week, urging all Americans to take actions to protect their families and friends from poisonous products, chemicals, and medicines found in homes and to raise awareness to prevent accidents and deaths.
