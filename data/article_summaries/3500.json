President Biden has been focused on providing support to small businesses in America since he took office. Over $400 billion in relief has been distributed to more than 6 million small businesses, helping them stay open and retain employees. This has led to a rebound in small business activity, with high demand for labor and inventories. Surveys have shown that small business owners are optimistic about their performance and are planning to create new jobs. The economic recovery has also sparked a surge in entrepreneurship, with a record number of Americans applying to start new businesses. The Biden-Harris Administration's approach to economic recovery has been bottom-up, with the enactment of the American Rescue Plan providing direct relief to families and small businesses. This support has given entrepreneurs the security to launch their own businesses. Despite the progress made so far, the administration remains committed to helping new small businesses grow and create jobs.
