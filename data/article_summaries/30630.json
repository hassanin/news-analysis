President Trump has announced the elevation of United States Cyber Command to the status of a Unified Combatant Command focused on cyberspace operations. This move aims to strengthen the country's cyberspace operations and improve defense. The elevation will streamline command and control of time-sensitive cyberspace operations under a single commander with appropriate authorities and funding. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense is considering separating United States Cyber Command from the National Security Agency, with recommendations to be announced later. The goal is to address cyberspace challenges in coordination with allies and partners, responding quickly to evolving global security threats.
