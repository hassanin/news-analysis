In this statement, President Barack Obama declares that the momentum against the Qadhafi regime in Libya has reached a tipping point, with Tripoli slipping from the regime's grasp. He emphasizes that the people of Libya are demonstrating their pursuit of dignity and freedom, which is stronger than the rule of a dictator. President Obama calls for Moammar Qadhafi and his regime to recognize that their rule has ended and relinquish power. The United States has recognized the Transitional National Council (TNC) as the legitimate governing authority in Libya. President Obama urges the TNC to demonstrate leadership by respecting the rights of the Libyan people, avoiding civilian casualties, protecting Libyan institutions, and pursuing a just and inclusive transition to democracy. He emphasizes that a season of conflict must lead to one of peace and states that the future of Libya is now in the hands of the Libyan people. The United States will continue to coordinate closely with the TNC, insist on the respect of basic rights for the Libyan people, and work with international allies and partners to protect the people of Libya and support a peaceful transition to democracy.
