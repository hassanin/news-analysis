President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on September 15, 2017, on the 230th anniversary of the Constitution of the United States. The proclamation celebrates the enduring brilliance of the Constitution and recognizes all American citizens. It emphasizes that the Constitution establishes a system of checks and balances designed to preserve liberty, promote prosperity, and ensure the security of the country. The proclamation calls for a return of power to the American people and emphasizes the importance of respecting the structural safeguards of the Constitution. It criticizes the growth of the federal government and the unaccountable army of regulators that burden American citizens and businesses with excessive rules and regulations. President Trump calls on all citizens and branches of government to reflect on the original meaning of the Constitution and to recall the founding principles of limited government and accountability. He calls on federal agencies to reduce regulatory burdens, on Congress to take up critical legislative measures, and on federal judges to apply the law as it exists. The proclamation also designates September 17 as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day and the week beginning September 17 as Constitution Week. It concludes by celebrating the citizens and the Constitution that have made America the greatest nation in the world and recommitting to the enduring principles of the Constitution.
