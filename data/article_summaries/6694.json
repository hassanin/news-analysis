Today marks the anniversary of three landmark Supreme Court cases that affirmed the right of every American to marry the person they love. The rulings in United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry, ten years ago, laid the foundation for marriage equality in the country. Two years later, the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges allowed millions of LGBTQI+ Americans to marry their partners. These cases were possible because of the courageous couples and advocates in the LGBTQI+ community who fought for these rights for decades. The Respect for Marriage Act was signed into law last year to guarantee the rights and protections of LGBTQI+ Americans. However, there is still work to be done, and the Equality Act is needed to provide additional protections against attacks on the rights and safety of the LGBTQI+ community. As Pride month concludes, the fight for full equality for all LGBTQI+ and all Americans must continue.
