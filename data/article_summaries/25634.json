The article discusses the positive impact of tax cuts on the U.S. economy and refutes several claims made by opponents of President Trump's policies. It states that the U.S. economy grew 4.1% in the second quarter, with an average quarterly growth rate of 2.9% during the Trump presidency. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports that faster growth under President Trump has added $1.3 trillion to the 10-year federal revenue projection, with a significant portion of the tax cuts being offset by additional revenue from economic growth. The article also argues that corporate tax cuts have benefited workers through higher bonuses and faster wage growth. Lastly, it dismisses the notion of "secular stagnation" as an excuse for slow economic growth during the Obama era, suggesting that strong growth under President Trump has disproven this claim.
