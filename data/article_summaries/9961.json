The White House has released a fact sheet on a gift basket that aims to sustain the action and strengthen the global nuclear security architecture after the Nuclear Security Summits. The gift basket proposes the creation of a Nuclear Security Contact Group, which will serve as a mechanism for senior officials to consult and coordinate national actions in line with the commitments made in summit communiqu√©s, action plans, gift baskets, and the 2010 Washington Work Plan. The Contact Group will meet annually and include 39 summit participants, as well as the United Nations and INTERPOL. Other countries interested in promoting nuclear security outcomes are also invited to join the Contact Group. The United States is looking forward to actively participating in the group to maintain the momentum of the Nuclear Security Summits.
