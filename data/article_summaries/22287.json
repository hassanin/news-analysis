President Obama is visiting Louisville, KY to discuss the Administration's efforts to grow the economy and provide more opportunities for Americans to join the middle class. Louisville is leading the way with the TechHire Initiative, which aims to give Americans pathways to well-paying technology jobs. The President has proposed an ambitious agenda to train and employ more people, including apprenticeships, competency-based training, accelerated training programs, and hiring approaches that focus on skills. In contrast, the House and Senate Republicans' budgets would make significant cuts to investments in training workers. The President's TechHire Initiative has brought together over 20 IT employers in Louisville to mentor and hire participants from Code Louisville, an initiative that trains and places new software developers. The President's budget invests in programs that lead to innovative training and job opportunities, while the Republican budgets would deeply cut the investments needed to prepare workers for available jobs. The President's budget includes proposals to expand technical training programs, promote industry-validated credentials, and support learn and earn strategies.
