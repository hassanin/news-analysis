Vice President Biden provided President Obama with an update on the progress of the Recovery Act, stating that spending is ahead of schedule and funds are being targeted effectively to create jobs and drive economic growth. More than 50% of the $499 billion in spending has been obligated, and $196 billion has been outlaid or provided as tax relief. The Administration is on track to meet the target of 70% of funds outlaid by September 30, 2010. The Vice President also highlighted the efforts to ensure that Recovery Act funds are being prudently spent on programs and projects that best achieve job creation and economic growth. Over 170 projects have been halted or modified to ensure better use of funds. The Vice President also provided updates on major Recovery programs, such as broadband, smart grid, high-speed rail, and health information technology. The Recovery Act, signed into law in February 2009, aims to create jobs and drive economic growth through tax relief, aid to families and governments, and funding for science, technology, and infrastructure projects. The Council of Economic Advisors estimates that the Recovery Act has created approximately 1 million jobs so far.
