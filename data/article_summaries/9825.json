The White House Christmas theme for 2013 is Gather Around, which celebrates coming together with loved ones and the stories behind American holiday traditions. The decorations feature handmade crafts and recycled pieces, with special art displays and Christmas trees made from repurposed books. The decorations also honor military families. Each room in the White House has a different theme and decorations, such as lanterns and gold pinecones at the East Visitor Entrance, a tree dedicated to fallen soldiers in the East Colonnade, and stacked book Christmas trees in the East Garden Room. Other rooms, such as the Library, Vermeil Room, State Dining Room, and Blue Room, each have their own unique decorations and ornaments. The official White House Christmas Tree in the Blue Room honors military families and features ornaments made by children living on military bases. The Green Room has flower ornaments and sugared fruits, while the East Room showcases handmade ornaments created by volunteers. Other interesting facts include the number of holiday volunteers by state, the height and width of the official White House Christmas Tree, the number of Christmas trees on the public tour route, and the amount of materials used in creating the decorations. Approximately 70,000 visitors are expected to visit the White House during the 2013 holiday season.
