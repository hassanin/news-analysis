The United States has expressed its support for the Saudi-led coalition's efforts to address the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The coalition has committed to transferring $930 million to United Nations agencies to support the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan by the end of March. Additionally, mobile cranes funded by the United States are now offloading supplies at Yemen's Hudaydah port. The United States appreciates the coalition's contribution to Yemen's reconstruction and its collaboration with the United Nations, World Food Programme (WFP), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to assist the Yemeni people. The United States is ready to assist Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in expanding access to food and medicine for Yemenis. It emphasizes the importance of unrestricted access to ports for delivering humanitarian and commercial goods. The United States urges the Houthis to cooperate with the international community to ensure essential supplies reach those in need. Resolving the conflict politically is crucial for addressing humanitarian needs and security concerns in the region. The United States applauds the recent commitments of key parties to renew diplomatic efforts and is prepared to support U.N.-led peace initiatives.
