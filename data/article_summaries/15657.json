President Obama has designated the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine's North Woods to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service. The monument, managed by the National Park Service, will protect approximately 87,500 acres of land, including the East Branch of the Penobscot River and a portion of the Maine Woods. The designation aims to permanently protect natural, scientific, historic, and cultural resources, wildlife habitat, and the pristine watershed in the region. The protected area will also contribute to climate resiliency and support recreational activities such as hiking, canoeing, hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. The land for the monument was donated by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby's foundation, Elliotsville Plantation, Inc., along with a $100 million gift that includes funds for park operational needs and infrastructure development. The designation builds on the tradition of growing the park system through private philanthropy and highlights the importance of protecting the environment for future generations. The National Park Service Centennial, marking 100 years of the National Park Service, serves as an opportunity to reflect on the history of America's iconic landscapes and cultural sites and look forward to the next century of conservation and historic preservation. Under President Obama, efforts have been made to encourage outdoor experiences for children, recognize cultural heritage, create jobs related to park management and restoration, designate national monuments reflecting diverse stories of Americans, increase public access to the outdoors for underserved communities, recognize the economic benefit of outdoor recreation, and focus on wildlife conservation and land and water conservation.
