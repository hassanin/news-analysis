President Obama and Vice President Biden hosted an "Insourcing American Jobs" forum at the White House on January 11, 2012. The forum focused on the increasing trend of companies choosing to bring jobs back to the United States and invest in the country. The President met with business leaders and experts to discuss why it's competitive to locate in the United States and what more can be done to encourage companies to insource American jobs. Cabinet officials also hosted panel discussions with small and large businesses and experts on insourcing and investing in America. Over a dozen businesses that have made the decision to bring jobs to the United States attended the forum, including Master Lock, Lincolnton Furniture, GalaxE Solutions, and DuPont. These companies cited reasons such as economic factors, labor availability challenges, and the desire for better service to customers as motivations for insourcing jobs.
