The Biden-Harris administration has announced a proposed rule that aims to improve online access to state and local services for people with disabilities. The rule, announced on the 33rd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), seeks to address the lack of accessibility to web and mobile-based services, such as voter registration, filing taxes, accessing social services, and taking online courses. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is proposing clear technical standards, including text descriptions of images, captions on videos, and keyboard navigation, to ensure equal access to services for people with vision, hearing, cognitive, and manual dexterity disabilities. The rule aims to make it easier for state and local governments to understand their ADA obligations and improve access for individuals with disabilities. This announcement follows previous actions by the Biden administration to support people with disabilities, including investments in accessible infrastructure, affordable internet, healthcare, and educational and job opportunities.
