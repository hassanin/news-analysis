In a press conference, President Biden discussed his recent calls with members of Congress, NATO allies, and the European Union regarding the situation in Russia and Ukraine. He emphasized the unity, determination, and resolve expressed by all parties. Biden shared information about the escalating crisis in Ukraine, including reports of ceasefire violations by Russian-backed fighters and disinformation campaigns by Russia. He stated that there is no evidence to support Russia's claims of Ukraine planning an offensive attack, and it defies logic to believe so given the current situation. Biden warned that Russian troops have surrounded Ukraine and expressed belief that Russia intends to attack Ukraine, specifically targeting Kyiv. The United States and its allies are prepared to defend NATO territory and support Ukraine, but they will not send troops to fight. Biden mentioned the financial and military aid provided to Ukraine and announced additional economic support. He made it clear that the United States and its allies will hold Russia accountable for its actions and are ready to impose severe sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. However, Biden also stated that diplomacy is still an option until Russia takes military action. He mentioned an upcoming meeting between Secretary of State Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov but warned that if Russia invades before that date, it will be seen as choosing war and will face consequences. Biden answered a few questions, expressing confidence in President Zelenskyy's judgment regarding leaving Ukraine if necessary and stating that he is convinced President Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine. He also mentioned that comprehensive sanctions are being considered and expressed skepticism about Putin's nuclear drills, suggesting they may be a cover for other intentions.
