Vice President Joe Biden has announced new international cooperation and investments as part of the Cancer Moonshot initiative. The announcements include ten new Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) for international cancer research and care, U.S. investment in regional centers of research excellence for low- and middle-income countries, and a commitment from the U.S. Department of State to increase emphasis on cancer collaborations in U.S. science and technology engagements worldwide. The MOUs focus on proteogenomics, which is the study of genes and their protein products in relation to cancer development and treatment. These agreements will facilitate the sharing of cancer-associated clinical research data and genetic information between institutions in the United States and other countries. In addition to the MOUs, three new agreements will promote collaboration in cancer research and care between the U.S. and Japan, Serbia, and Sweden. The Vice President also announced the creation of a network of Regional Centers of Research Excellence (RCREs) to support partnerships between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries in addressing cancer disparities. Finally, the U.S. Department of State has committed to highlighting and identifying opportunities for cooperation in the Cancer Moonshot in its bilateral science and technology engagements.
