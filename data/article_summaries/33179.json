Gina Haspel, the current Acting Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), has been nominated by President Donald Trump to become the permanent Director of the CIA. Haspel, who joined the CIA during the Cold War, has served in various dangerous posts and has received multiple honors for her dedication and excellence in counterterrorism. Her promotion from within the Agency is seen as a testament to the crucial work of CIA public servants and a milestone for women, as she is the first woman to climb the ranks to become Deputy Director and be nominated for CIA Director. Haspel has gained bipartisan support for her nomination due to her reputation for providing objective assessments and her commitment to the rule of law and Congressional oversight. Former CIA officials and national security experts have expressed their confidence in her abilities, and the CIA workforce trusts her to oversee her responsibilities.
