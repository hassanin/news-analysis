The White House has deployed approximately 80 U.S. Armed Forces personnel to Chad to assist in locating and supporting the safe return of over 200 kidnapped schoolgirls in Nigeria. These personnel will be involved in operating intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft for missions over northern Nigeria and the surrounding area. The deployment is in line with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, and it has been authorized by President Barack Obama as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. The President has sent this letter to inform Congress about the deployment, as required by the War Powers Resolution.
