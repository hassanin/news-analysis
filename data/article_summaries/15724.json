President Obama has launched the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), which brings together industry, universities, and the federal government to invest in emerging technologies that will create manufacturing jobs and enhance global competitiveness. The plan will invest over $500 million in key areas such as national security industries, advanced materials, robotics, energy efficiency, and new technologies. The AMP will be led by Andrew Liveris, CEO of Dow Chemical, and Susan Hockfield, President of MIT. The initiative aims to accelerate the development and deployment of advanced manufacturing technologies, as well as support small and mid-sized manufacturers. The government has also announced additional commitments, including funding for research in next-generation robotics and energy-efficient manufacturing processes.
