President Biden began his speech by expressing his belief in the ability of Democrats, Republicans, and independents to come together and achieve significant things. He mentioned that he recently signed a bipartisan government funding bill that includes the establishment of ARPA-H, an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. This agency is inspired by the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency and aims to drive breakthroughs in biomedicine, particularly in the prevention, detection, and treatment of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes. President Biden thanked the bipartisan members of Congress who have been instrumental in advancing this initiative. He highlighted that ARPA-H will pursue bold ideas that are not typically supported by traditional research funding mechanisms and that are deemed too risky by the private sector. The President emphasized the transformative potential of ARPA-H and its focus on equity, ensuring that cutting-edge healthcare innovations are accessible to all Americans. He also mentioned that the meeting would feature the DARPA Director, Stefanie Tompkins, who would discuss the promise of ARPA-H, as well as a patient who has benefited from DARPA research. President Biden concluded by stating that America is defined by its possibilities.
