The Trump administration has announced a plan to replace the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era regulation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Republican officials and industry groups have praised the move, arguing that the Clean Power Plan was burdensome, costly, and illegal. They believe that the new plan, called the Affordable Clean Energy rule, will provide more flexibility to states and protect the economy while still addressing environmental concerns. Supporters of the new rule argue that it will empower states to determine their own emissions standards and energy portfolios. However, critics argue that the move is a step backward in the fight against climate change and will lead to increased pollution and health risks.
