In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany criticized House and Senate Democrats for leaving town without making a deal to provide relief to the American people. She accused Democrats of prioritizing the United States Postal Service (USPS) as a manufactured crisis, while neglecting other important issues such as stimulus checks, small-business relief, and eviction protections. McEnany also discussed the President's stance on the upcoming election, his support for law enforcement, and his comments regarding Goodyear tires. She emphasized that the President wants a fair election and believes that voter fraud is a concern, particularly with mail-in ballots. McEnany also addressed the President's tweets about Goodyear and defended his position, stating that he stands with law enforcement and believes that Blue Lives Matter is an equity issue. She called on Goodyear to clarify its policy and accused the company of targeting certain ideologies. The briefing also touched on topics such as the President's position on QAnon, the US-China trade deal, and the visit of the Prime Minister from Iraq. McEnany concluded the briefing by announcing that over 1,000 arrests have been made as part of Operation LeGend, an initiative to combat violence in cities.
