The Council of Economic Advisers highlights the economic changes during the first three years of the Trump Administration. They state that the United States experienced unprecedented gains in personal income and wealth, along with a reduction in wealth inequality. The expansion period from 2017 to 2019 saw strong wage and income gains, with historically disadvantaged groups benefiting the most. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 contributed to wage growth for production workers and increased real wealth for the bottom 50 percent of households. Job creation and GDP growth exceeded previous projections, indicating economic strength before the COVID-19 pandemic. The article also mentions that the United States has experienced a fast economic recovery in the past five months, attributing it to a solid pre-pandemic economy and unprecedented economic actions in response to the crisis. The Trump Administration aims to continue supporting pro-growth policies to improve living standards for working families and businesses.
