Cecilia Rouse, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, has played a crucial role in navigating the challenges faced by the U.S. economy in the past two years. With insightful analysis and a new approach to assessing problems, she has maintained a sense of calmness throughout. Since joining the administration, the economy has seen significant changes, including the creation of over 12 million jobs, a near 50-year low in unemployment, a thriving American manufacturing sector, and the establishment of over 10 million new small businesses. Rouse shares the President's economic vision and understands the importance of building a resilient, fair, and inclusive economy that values everyday workers. While she will be missed, she will continue her important work at Princeton University in the years to come.
