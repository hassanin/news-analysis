The American Climate Corps is a workforce training and service initiative launched by President Biden as part of his commitment to tackling the climate crisis. The program aims to put over 20,000 young people on career pathways in clean energy, conservation, and climate resilience. Participants will receive skills-based training and work on projects such as conserving and restoring lands and waters, deploying clean energy, and advancing environmental justice. The program prioritizes equity and environmental justice, focusing on communities traditionally left behind and energy communities that have powered the nation for generations. The White House is calling on various stakeholders to collaborate and expand skills-based training partnerships. The program has already launched in ten states, and a new website has been launched for those interested in joining or supporting the American Climate Corps. The initiative builds on the administration's investments in expanding pathways to good-paying union jobs, including in clean energy and climate-focused careers.
