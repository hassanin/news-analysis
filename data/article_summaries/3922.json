The United States strongly condemns the recent drone and missile attack on Iraq's Kurdistan region. The US stands with Iraq's leaders in denouncing these attacks as a violation of Iraq's sovereignty. The US also criticizes Iran for disregarding the lives of its own people and its neighbors, and for violating principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US believes that Iran is using these attacks to deflect blame from its internal problems and the legitimate grievances of its population. The US calls for universal condemnation of Iran's use of missiles and drones against its neighbors, as well as its support of drones for Russia's aggression in Ukraine and for proxies in the Middle East. The US will continue to pursue sanctions and other measures to disrupt Iran's destabilizing activities in the region.
