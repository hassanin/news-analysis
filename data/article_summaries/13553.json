The Obama Administration has announced enhanced measures, in collaboration with China, to combat the supply of fentanyl and its analogues to the United States. China has taken steps to control substances that pose a threat to public safety, but it remains the primary source of precursor chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine consumed in the United States, as well as the majority of fentanyl and its analogues brought to the country by drug traffickers. China has committed to targeting exports of substances controlled in the US but not in China. Both countries have agreed to increase the exchange of law enforcement and scientific information to coordinate actions against substances and chemicals of concern. However, there is still more work to be done to protect Americans from dangerous narcotics. Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, is being mixed with heroin or sold as counterfeit prescription opioid pills, contributing to the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic in the US. The majority of illicit fentanyl in the US is smuggled from Mexico or China. The President has prioritized addressing this epidemic and increasing access to treatment for substance use disorders. The President has called for $1.1 billion in new funding to support treatment efforts, but Congressional action is needed to provide these additional resources.
