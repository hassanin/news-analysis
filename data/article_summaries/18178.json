This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary regarding the continuation of the national emergency on the disposition of Russian highly enriched uranium. The national emergency was declared in 2012 due to the risk of nuclear proliferation caused by the accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in Russia. The full implementation of the agreement between the US and Russia on the disposition of highly enriched uranium is essential for US national security and foreign policy goals. The notice states that assets of the Russian government related to the implementation of the agreement may be subject to legal processes, which could jeopardize its implementation. Therefore, the national emergency and the measures taken to address it will continue for another year.
