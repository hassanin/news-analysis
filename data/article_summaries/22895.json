The White House has issued a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan, which was declared in 1997, will continue for another year. The national emergency was initially declared due to the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan that posed a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The conflict in Sudan's Darfur region was later determined to be an additional threat, leading to the expansion of the national emergency. The notice explains that the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States, and therefore, the national emergency must remain in effect. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
