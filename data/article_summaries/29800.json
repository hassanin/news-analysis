The United States has condemned the military offensive by the Assad regime, with support from Russia and Iran, against the people of Eastern Ghouta. Russia has ignored the terms of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2401, which called for a 30-day ceasefire, and has continued to kill innocent civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations. Russian military aircraft have conducted daily bombing missions in Damascus and Eastern Ghouta. The pro-regime forces must stop targeting medical infrastructure and civilians. The Assad regime, along with its backers in Moscow and Tehran, should adhere to the UN resolution, cease hostilities, and allow humanitarian aid to reach the nearly 400,000 civilians in need.
