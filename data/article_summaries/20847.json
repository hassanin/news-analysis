The article is a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. In the letter, President Obama states that he has issued an Executive Order revoking certain Sudan-related sanctions. He explains that the actions taken in the Executive Order were in response to the policies and actions of the Government of Sudan, including support for terrorism, destabilization of neighboring governments, and human rights violations. However, President Obama acknowledges that the situation in Sudan has improved over the past six months, with positive actions taken by the Sudanese government, such as a reduction in offensive military activity and steps towards improving humanitarian access. Therefore, he determines that there is no further need for the sanctions imposed by the Executive Order. The revocation of the sanctions will become effective 180 days from January 13, 2017, provided that certain further actions are taken by the Secretary of State. The letter also outlines a reporting requirement for the Secretary of State to assess Sudan's progress in sustaining the positive actions and provides recommendations for appropriate U.S. Government responses.
