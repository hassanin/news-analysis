The White House Office of the Press Secretary has announced the appointment of the 2014-2015 Class of White House Fellows. The Fellows come from diverse backgrounds and have demonstrated a strong commitment to public service and leadership. The White House Fellows program was created in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson to give promising American leaders "first hand, high-level experience with the workings of the Federal government, and to increase their sense of participation in national affairs." The Fellows take part in an education program designed to broaden their knowledge of leadership, policy formulation, and current affairs. Community service is also an essential element of the program. Selection as a White House Fellow is highly competitive and based on a record of professional achievement, evidence of leadership potential, and a proven commitment to public service. The 2014-2015 Class of Fellows and their biographies are included in the article.
