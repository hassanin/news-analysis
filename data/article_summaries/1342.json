The Biden-Harris Administration attended the Executive Meeting of the Roundtable on Macroeconomic and Climate-related Risks and Opportunities, hosted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The goal of this Roundtable is to understand how climate change affects macroeconomic performance and explore the implications for fiscal, monetary, and financial stability policies. The President aims to transition to a net-zero economy by 2050 and has called on the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and Budget to identify federal climate-related financial risk exposure. The CEA and the OMB have published two assessments, "Federal Budget Exposure to Climate Risks" and a new section in the "Long-Term Budget Outlook" focused on climate change. They have also released a white paper on better modeling the economic impacts of climate change. The Roundtable aims to incorporate climate risk into macroeconomic projections and discuss policy pathways to address climate risks while considering socioeconomic equity. The Interagency Technical Working Group is developing methodologies for integrating climate risks into the President's budget, and discussions with the Roundtable will guide longer-term work and the development of new tools and models.
