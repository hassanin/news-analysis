President Obama and other administration officials are traveling across the country to visit Recovery Act project sites and hold "Recovery Summer" events. The Recovery Act has funded tens of thousands of projects and put about 2.5 million Americans to work. This summer is the most active season for Recovery Act projects, with thousands of new projects breaking ground. President Obama will visit Smith Electric Vehicles in Kansas City, Missouri, where he will tour the facilities and deliver remarks on the economy. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood will visit the future site of the Kent Multimodal Transit Facility in Ohio. Other officials will visit housing developments, break ground on green buildings, and announce funding for broadband projects and solar companies.
