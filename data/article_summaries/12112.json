President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation designating Memorial Day, May 30, 2016, as a day of prayer for permanent peace. He acknowledges the courage and patriotism of America's men and women in uniform who have sacrificed their lives to protect the country and its ideals. The proclamation also calls for the observance of a National Moment of Remembrance at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. President Obama requests that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on Memorial Day and encourages the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes during the morning.
