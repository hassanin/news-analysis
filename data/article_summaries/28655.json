President Donald Trump unveiled his administration's new strategy for missile defense during a speech at the Pentagon. The goal of the strategy is to ensure that the United States can detect and destroy any missile launched against the country. The strategy includes prioritizing the defense of the American people, developing new technology, protecting against all types of missile attacks, recognizing space as a new warfighting domain, removing bureaucratic obstacles, and insisting on fair burden sharing with allies. Trump emphasized the importance of strong borders and border security, and called for the construction of a wall on the southern border. He also expressed condolences for the American service members who were killed in Syria and addressed the ongoing government shutdown.
