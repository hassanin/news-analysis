The Biden-Harris Administration has released the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, which aims to tackle antisemitism in America through a whole-of-society approach. The strategy includes over 100 actions that government agencies will take, as well as calls to action for Congress, companies, technology platforms, students, teachers, civil society, and faith leaders. The strategy is built on four pillars: increasing awareness and understanding of antisemitism, improving safety and security for Jewish communities, reversing the normalization of antisemitism, and building cross-community solidarity and collective action against hate. The strategy emphasizes the importance of education, data collection, enforcement of hate crime laws, and partnerships with diverse communities and faiths to combat antisemitism.
