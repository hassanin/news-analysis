President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Michigan and ordered Federal assistance to help with recovery efforts after severe storms and flooding occurred from May 16 to May 22, 2020. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Arenac, Gladwin, Iosco, Midland, and Saginaw. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for State and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide can also be funded on a cost-sharing basis. Waddy Gonzalez has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. seven days a week until further notice. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
