President Obama met with President Santos of Colombia on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. They discussed various bilateral, regional, and international issues to strengthen the already strong partnership between the United States and Colombia. President Obama praised President Santos for his recent election and his diplomatic efforts in the region, as well as his national reforms. He reiterated the long-standing commitment of the United States to address Colombia's security challenges and help consolidate the important achievements of the past decade in achieving a just and lasting peace. President Obama congratulated the Colombian people, their security forces, and President Santos for their persistent efforts against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), including the successful operation this week against FARC military leader Jorge Briceño Suárez, also known as "Mono Jojoy." The President also emphasized his determination to work towards strengthening economic ties between the two countries for the benefit of workers and consumers in the United States and Colombia. Additionally, the Presidents directed their teams to launch the US-Colombia High-Level Partnership Dialogue, which aims to enhance cooperation across a wide range of issues such as social and economic opportunities, democracy, human rights, climate change, energy, and culture and education. The dialogue will begin when Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg visits Colombia later this Fall and will involve representatives from both governments.
