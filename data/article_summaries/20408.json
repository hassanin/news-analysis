The United States has announced further actions in response to Russia's intervention in Ukraine. Despite commitments made at a contact group meeting in Geneva, Russia has escalated the crisis and been involved in recent violence in eastern Ukraine. In light of this, the United States is imposing targeted sanctions on Russian individuals and entities and restricting licenses for certain exports to Russia. The sanctions include asset freezes and visa bans on seven Russian government officials, including two members of President Putin's inner circle, as well as 17 companies linked to Putin's inner circle. The Department of Commerce is imposing additional restrictions on these companies and tightening policies to deny export licenses for high-technology items that could contribute to Russia's military capabilities. The United States remains prepared to impose greater costs on Russia if they continue their provocations in Ukraine.
