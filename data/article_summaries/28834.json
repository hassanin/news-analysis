President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed April 2020 as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. The proclamation emphasizes the commitment to supporting survivors of sexual assault, encouraging strong criminal justice responses, and ending sexual violence in homes and communities. The proclamation highlights the emotional and mental trauma that survivors endure and the impact it has on their relationships. The administration has made combating sexual assault a top priority, including establishing a task force on missing and murdered Native Americans and Alaska Natives. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is providing grant funding to analyze sexual assault kits, ensuring law enforcement and prosecutors have resources to support victims and bring offenders to justice. The administration is also addressing human trafficking, which often includes sexual assault, through executive orders, legislation, and increased funding. The proclamation calls on all Americans, law enforcement, healthcare providers, and community organizations to support survivors and work together to prevent sexual assault.
