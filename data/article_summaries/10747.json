The Obama Administration has announced new policies to promote conservation and build resilience to climate change, with a focus on the Pacific Islands. The Administration is investing nearly $40 million to enhance resilience to climate change and advance clean-energy development in the Pacific Islands. This includes building regional, national, and local capacity to prepare for climate change, through programs such as the Institutional Strengthening in Pacific Island Countries to Adapt to Climate Change (ISACC) Program and the Climate Ready Program. The Administration is also providing $15 million in disaster risk reduction programs and supporting community-based initiatives to help communities prepare for and respond to natural disasters. Additionally, the United States is contributing $8 million to a World Bank multi-donor trust fund to support the creation of a disaster and climate risk insurance facility for Pacific Islands. The Administration is also expanding research on climate migration and relocation and is hosting a Symposium on Climate Displacement, Migration, and Relocation in December 2016. In terms of promoting conservation, the Administration is releasing the State of Conservation in North America Report, establishing a partnership with the Vietnam Biodiversity Agency, and launching the Next Generation Conservation Ambassadors Program. Other initiatives include restoring humpback whale populations, supporting the expansion of large-scale marine protected areas, and issuing a unified strategy with the International Oceanographic Commission. Finally, the Administration is announcing new grants to combat wildlife trafficking.
