Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, met with women mayors and allies to discuss reproductive rights. Mayors play a crucial role in implementing policies and can support reproductive health care by promoting education, funding services, sharing accurate information, and taking actions to protect abortion access. The Women Mayors Network released a letter signed by over 65 women mayors and male allies, committing to safeguard clinics, support residents seeking abortion services, and organize for expanded access. During the meeting, mayors shared their observations and actions on the ground, and the White House officials expressed gratitude for their leadership, reaffirming the Administration's commitment to protecting abortion access.
