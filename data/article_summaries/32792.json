On July 19, 2018, President Trump launched the National Council for the American Worker and signed an executive order to establish it. The council will be composed of top officials across the government and an outside advisory board of industry leaders and experts. The goal of the council is to develop a national workforce strategy to equip Americans of all ages and career stages with the skills they need to succeed in the modern economy. The president also announced a new pledge to America's workers, with 23 companies and associations committing to train and re-train over 3.8 million American students and workers for new jobs and rewarding careers.
