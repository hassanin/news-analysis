The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has released a report emphasizing the importance of reskilling American workers for future jobs. The report highlights the changing nature of the labor market and the skills that employers now require. It notes that investment in skill development is primarily focused on the first 25 years of life, with employer training being the largest investment in further developing workforce skills. The report suggests that restrictions on the use of Federal funds for reskilling programs may not be suitable for addressing future challenges. It also highlights an information gap between employers, workers, and educational institutions, with workers and educational institutions lacking up-to-date knowledge of the skills that employers seek. The report emphasizes the need for coordination among these parties to effectively address America's reskilling challenge.
