The United States has been the largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) since 2006. The country offers an attractive investment climate with a large consumer market, skilled workers, innovation, legal protections, and a growing energy sector. In 2012, net U.S. assets of foreign affiliates totaled $3.9 trillion, and FDI inflows totaled $166 billion. The manufacturing sector, particularly pharmaceuticals and petroleum and coal products, receives a significant share of FDI. Other industries like wholesale trade, mining, non-bank holding companies, finance and insurance, and banking also attract foreign investment. The majority of investment comes from industrial countries like Japan, Canada, Australia, Korea, and European countries, but emerging economies like China and Brazil are increasing their investment. FDI benefits the U.S. economy by contributing to private output, employment, investment, and research and development spending. During the 2008-09 recession and recovery, employment at U.S. affiliates was more stable than overall private-sector employment. U.S. affiliates' share of total U.S. manufacturing employment also increased. Compensation at U.S. affiliates is consistently higher than the U.S. average. To continue attracting foreign investment, the U.S. needs to maintain its strengths such as an open investment regime, a large economy, a skilled labor force, community colleges, research universities, predictable regulations, adequate infrastructure, and new energy sources.
