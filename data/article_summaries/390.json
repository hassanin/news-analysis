President Biden will sign the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal into law, which aims to rebuild infrastructure, create jobs, and boost the economy. The President is focused on ensuring that these investments benefit communities, strengthen US manufacturing, and are resilient to climate change. To guide implementation, an Executive Order has been signed, outlining six main priorities for the government. Additionally, an Infrastructure Implementation Task Force has been established, co-chaired by National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and White House Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu. The Task Force includes various agencies and aims to overcome obstacles and drive infrastructure investments at all levels of government.
