President Biden will sign an Executive Order to support American manufacturers, businesses, and workers. The order ensures that taxpayer dollars are spent on American-made goods by American workers and with American-made components. It aims to fulfill President Biden's promise to make Buy American a reality and close loopholes that allow companies to offshore production while still qualifying for domestic preferences. The order will invest taxpayer dollars in American businesses, create well-paid union jobs, and support minority entrepreneurs and businesses in every region. It also aims to strengthen manufacturing capabilities, build a clean energy future, and enhance national security. The executive action is part of President Biden's commitment to increase investments in manufacturing industries and workers. The order establishes goals and standards to use federal purchasing and assistance to invest in American industry and maintain a leading position in the global marketplace. The President also intends to work with partners and allies to modernize international trade rules.
