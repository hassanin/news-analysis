The United States is optimistic about the progress made in the Colombia peace negotiations, particularly the six-month timeline for signing a final agreement. They hope that the negotiations will be successful and bring about a lasting peace after more than 50 years of armed conflict. The US has been supporting Colombia through various initiatives, including the comprehensive Plan Colombia launched 16 years ago with bipartisan support. Last year, a Special Envoy was appointed at the request of President Santos to aid the peace process. The US will continue to support Colombia in ending the armed conflict and promoting prosperity in the country. The US congratulates President Santos and his team for their dedication to peace and views this as a significant step towards a final accord.
