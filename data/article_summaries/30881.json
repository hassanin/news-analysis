President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria will continue beyond May 11, 2019. The President believes that the Syrian regime's actions, including the use of chemical weapons and support for terrorist organizations, pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The President also condemns the Assad regime's use of violence and human rights abuses and calls for a political transition in Syria towards freedom, democracy, and justice. The United States will consider changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Syrian government in deciding whether to continue or terminate the national emergency in the future.
