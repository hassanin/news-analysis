In a letter to the Speaker of the House, President Barack Obama expresses his commitment to supporting the troops and improving their quality of life. As part of this commitment, the Obama Administration proposes temporarily increasing the Army's active component by up to 22,000 personnel, including 15,000 troops in Fiscal Year 2010. The goal of this increase is to reduce the strain on the force and provide more time at home between deployments. The President states that eight years of sustained combat operations have taken a toll on soldiers and their families, and expanding the Army will help alleviate stress and strain. The increase in troops will also allow for more deployments and help end the practice of retaining soldiers beyond their obligated service. The President asks Congress to consider the proposed budget amendments for the Department of Defense, which would be offset by reallocating approximately $1.0 billion from lower-priority contingency operations. These funds are no longer needed due to changed circumstances and the availability of sufficient resources to protect US personnel.
