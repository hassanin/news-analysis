Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown about addressing the root causes of migration from northern Central America. She emphasized that people leave their homes because they are fleeing harm or cannot meet their basic needs. Harris highlighted the importance of government partnering with the private sector and civil society to address these issues. She outlined the guiding principles of their Root Causes Strategy, which includes addressing corruption, promoting the rule of law, reducing violence, and empowering women. Harris announced that since the launch of their Call to Action last year, they have generated over $3.2 billion of investment in the region, which will create tens of thousands of jobs and provide banking services and credit to over 10 million people. She also announced the next phase of the Call to Action, called "In Her Hands," which aims to empower, protect, and train women in Northern Central America. Harris emphasized that when women succeed, society as a whole benefits, and the initiative includes commitments from companies and organizations to support women-owned businesses, connect women to the banking system, increase women's participation in the agriculture industry, and provide training in coding and cybersecurity. The administration's strategy also focuses on reducing gender-based violence in the region, as economic empowerment for women is closely linked to improved quality of life and a reduction in violence. Harris concluded by emphasizing the need to coordinate efforts between the private sector, non-profit community, and public sector to create an ecosystem of opportunity for women in the region.
