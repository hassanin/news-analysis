The article discusses the implementation of innovative workplace practices in the United States to improve the health of workers and reduce healthcare spending. The rising costs of healthcare are affecting families, companies, and the overall economic growth of the country. Employers and unions are using creative approaches to reverse this trend, resulting in increased engagement of workers in their own healthcare, improved productivity, reduced absenteeism, and employers passing on healthcare savings to their workers. The article highlights examples of successful healthcare programs, such as the H.E.R.E.I.U. Welfare Fund's wellness and chronic disease management programs, Johnson & Johnson's disease management and prevention interventions, Microsoft's personalized health goals and on-site doctors, Ohio Department of Health's comprehensive health management program, Pitney Bowes' comprehensive health clinics and fitness centers, REI's support for outdoor activities and healthy lifestyle goals, and Safeway's benefit design to reward healthy behaviors. These initiatives have shown promising results in reducing healthcare costs and improving employees' health. The President aims to encourage more employers to adopt similar programs to improve workforce productivity and reduce complications from chronic diseases.
