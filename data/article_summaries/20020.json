President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of West Virginia, following severe storms and flooding on June 13, 2013. This declaration allows federal aid to be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The counties of Mason and Roane are specifically mentioned in the declaration, but additional designations may be made if further damage assessments warrant it. Jack Schuback has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
