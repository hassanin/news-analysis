President Obama has made sustainable development a core pillar of American foreign policy. The White House Summit on Global Development, held on July 20th, brought together development leaders, financing partners, civil society, diplomats, and entrepreneurs to mark global progress and encourage further development efforts. The President's commitment to global development builds on over a half century of U.S. leadership, including the creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief under President George W. Bush. The U.S. Global Development Policy, issued in 2010, elevated global development to the same level as diplomacy and defense. The President's signature development initiatives include Feed the Future, Power Africa, and investments in global health. These initiatives have led to significant reductions in poverty, improvements in agricultural productivity, advancements in nutrition, and progress in fighting diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and Ebola. Power Africa aims to double access to energy in sub-Saharan Africa and has leveraged public and private sector commitments of nearly $43 billion. The Obama Administration has also focused on catalyzing private investment and other sources of financing, promoting transparency, accountability, and open government, broadening partnerships, and fostering future leadership through initiatives such as the Young African Leadership Initiative and Let Girls Learn. Overall, the Obama Administration has reshaped the U.S. approach to development by emphasizing sustainable development outcomes, leveraging new partners, and prioritizing transparency and accountability.
