Vice President Biden issued a statement congratulating the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for approving the New START Treaty with a strong bipartisan majority. He believes that once the treaty takes effect, it will protect our security, make the world safer, improve our relationship with Russia, and enable us to deepen cooperation on key issues. He also urges the full Senate to give this agreement the same broad bipartisan support.
