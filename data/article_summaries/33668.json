During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, the First Lady and President Trump express their condolences to those who have lost loved ones to ovarian cancer and raise awareness about the signs and symptoms of the disease. They pledge their support to those currently battling ovarian cancer and vow to continue efforts in finding new treatments and methods of care. Early detection is emphasized, with regular medical checkups and knowledge of risk factors being crucial in saving lives. Common symptoms such as bloating, pelvic pain, and difficulty eating or urinating should not be ignored. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that approximately 14,000 American women will die from ovarian cancer this year. The administration is committed to improving quality of care and increasing access to treatment. President Trump has worked to reduce regulations to speed up the development of drugs and treatments and has signed Right to Try legislation to expand access to potentially life-saving drugs. The President and First Lady send their prayers to those fighting ovarian cancer and pledge to work towards finding a cure for the disease.
