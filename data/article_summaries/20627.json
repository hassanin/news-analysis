National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice released a statement expressing delight that Meriam Yahya Ibrahim Ishag, who was sentenced to death in Sudan for apostasy, is now safe and free. She will soon be traveling to the United States with her immediate family, including her infant daughter who was born in custody. Rice thanked the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum and the broader U.S. government for their support, as well as the Italian Government for their efforts. She emphasized that Ms. Ishag's freedom serves as a reminder that all countries must uphold the universal right to freedom of religion, and that the United States will continue to support those denied this freedom.
