President Biden held a press conference in the Rose Garden to announce new measures to combat the proliferation of ghost guns. Ghost guns are firearms that are assembled from kits and do not have serial numbers, making them difficult to trace. The President emphasized the need to address the issue of ghost guns, which have been used in crimes across the country. He announced that the Department of Justice will make it illegal for businesses to manufacture ghost gun kits without serial numbers and for licensed dealers to sell them without conducting background checks. The President also highlighted the importance of holding gun manufacturers accountable and called on Congress to pass universal background checks and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. He nominated Steve Dettelbach as the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and urged the Senate to confirm him. The President also discussed other strategies to reduce gun violence, such as cracking down on rogue gun dealers, disrupting illegal gun trafficking, funding community policing and violence intervention programs, and investing in jobs and training for young people.
