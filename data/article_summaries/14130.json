This article is a presidential memorandum from Barack Obama regarding refugee admissions for fiscal year 2014. The memorandum states that up to 70,000 refugees will be admitted to the United States during this period based on humanitarian concerns and national interest. The allocation of these admissions is determined by regional allocations, with specific numbers set for each region. Any unallocated refugee numbers can be used as needed, and unused admissions can be transferred to other regions if necessary. The memorandum also designates certain groups of people, such as persons in Cuba and Iraq, as refugees eligible for admission to the United States. The Secretary of State is instructed to report this determination to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
