On the fifth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama released a statement highlighting the successes of the law. He stated that over 16 million uninsured Americans have gained health insurance, reducing the ranks of the uninsured by nearly one third. The law has allowed parents to afford healthcare for their children, prevented families from losing their homes or savings due to illness, and allowed young people to pursue their dreams without worrying about losing access to healthcare. For those who already had insurance, the law has provided new savings and protections. Tens of millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions are now protected from being denied coverage, women are no longer charged more for being women, and young people can stay on their parents' plan until age 26. Additionally, over 9 million seniors and people with disabilities have saved money on prescription medicine, and over 70 million Americans have gained access to preventive care. The law has also improved the quality of healthcare, resulting in 50,000 fewer preventable patient deaths in hospitals. Despite initial concerns about the impact on jobs and the economy, the Affordable Care Act has not caused premiums to skyrocket and has contributed to a slowdown in healthcare cost growth. In fact, healthcare costs have grown at their slowest rate in nearly 50 years, leading to a reduction in the deficit. The President emphasized that the law has faced significant opposition and attempts to dismantle it, but after five years, it is clear that the Affordable Care Act is working and exceeding expectations. He called for continued efforts to improve the healthcare system for everyone and criticized proposals, such as the House Republican budget, that would result in millions losing insurance. The President reaffirmed his commitment to ensuring that quality, affordable healthcare is a right for all Americans.
