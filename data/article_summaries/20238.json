The Obama Administration has announced the launch of a new public-private institute for manufacturing innovation in Youngstown, Ohio. The National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) will receive $30 million in federal funding, matched by $40 million from a consortium of businesses, universities, community colleges, and non-profit organizations. The goal of the institute is to revitalize American manufacturing and encourage companies to invest in the United States. Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, will be a focus of the institute, with potential applications in industries such as defense, aerospace, automotive, and metals manufacturing. The NAMII is led by the National Center for Defense Manufacturing and Machining and includes companies like Boeing, IBM, and Honeywell, as well as research universities and community colleges. This initiative is part of President Obama's plan to invest $1 billion in a national network of manufacturing innovation institutes.
