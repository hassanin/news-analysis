Since President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law one year ago, companies have announced over $166 billion in investments in semiconductors and electronics. The law includes a $53 billion investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, research and development, and workforce, as well as a 25 percent tax credit for capital investments in semiconductor manufacturing. The goal of the law is to increase American competitiveness, strengthen supply chains, and support national security and access to key technologies.

In addition to the investments, at least 50 community colleges in 19 states have announced new or expanded programs to train workers for the semiconductor industry. Since the start of the Biden-Harris administration, companies have announced over $231 billion in commitments in semiconductor and electronics investments in the United States.

The government has also been implementing programs to encourage domestic semiconductor manufacturing, invest in research and development, and support supply chain resilience and workforce development. This includes issuing proposed rules to protect national security and prevent misuse of technology and innovation funded by the CHIPS program.

Overall, the CHIPS and Science Act has made significant progress in promoting semiconductor manufacturing and innovation in the United States, as well as creating job opportunities and supporting regional economic development.
