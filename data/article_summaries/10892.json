President Barack Obama released a statement on the retirement of Congressman Gary Ackerman, praising his thirty-year career representing the people of Queens and Long Island. Ackerman's bipartisan efforts helped address both domestic and international challenges, including his role in passing Wall Street Reform and strengthening ties with Israel. He also successfully enacted a bill to create the "Heroes" postage stamp, benefiting the families of 9/11 rescue workers. The President expressed confidence that Ackerman will continue to serve the people of New York in the future and wished him and his family well.
