The American Legion Boys Nation and American Legion Auxiliary Girls Nation programs bring together a group of talented rising high school seniors from across the US to learn about the structure and function of the federal government. During American Heroes Week, President Trump addressed the group at the White House, expressing his support for these young leaders and thanking the American heroes who have served the nation to make these programs possible. Dawson Schefter, an alumnus of the Boys Nation program and a White House intern, highlighted the dedication of these young men and women to serving others and expressed his belief that the future of the nation lies in their hands.
