The Obama Administration has prioritized trade enforcement and has worked to build a stronger system. They have taken various actions to identify, monitor, enforce, and resolve international trade issues in order to protect American workers, farmers, and businesses. The United States has filed 25 enforcement actions at the World Trade Organization (WTO) since 2009, winning every single one of these challenges. They have also imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duty penalties on foreign industries and trading partners, particularly in the steel industry. The Obama Administration has pursued diplomatic engagement to uphold labor rights, protect the environment, and ensure intellectual property rights are enforced. They have also led efforts to combat excess capacity in industrial sectors, such as the steel industry, by forming a Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity and securing commitments from China to reduce excess capacity. The Obama Administration has built stronger enforcement authorities and coordination through legislation, such as the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act and the American Trade Enforcement Effectiveness Act. They have also taken measures to bolster trade enforcement tools, such as implementing new procedures for investigating claims of evasion of anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders and establishing an interagency Trade Enforcement Task Force. Additionally, they have focused on enforcing anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders on steel imports and have collected over $1.5 billion in duties in FY 2016. The Obama Administration has made significant progress in trade enforcement and has taken steps to level the playing field for American workers and businesses.
