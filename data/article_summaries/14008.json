President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 2016 as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. He highlights the contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) to the United States and recognizes the challenges they have faced throughout history. The AAPI community is the fastest growing racial group in the country and is culturally and linguistically diverse. President Obama acknowledges the discrimination, harassment, and violence that some AAPIs experience, as well as the obstacles they face in areas such as education, employment, and healthcare. The administration is committed to supporting AAPI communities through initiatives like the Affordable Care Act and the White House Initiative on AAPIs. Efforts are also being made to improve data collection to counter stereotypes and address the needs of the AAPI community. President Obama calls on all Americans to learn more about AAPI heritage and observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
