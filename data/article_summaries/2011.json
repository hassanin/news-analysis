President Biden hosted a meeting with congressional leaders to discuss the need to prevent the United States from defaulting on its debt for the first time in history. They also discussed reaching a bipartisan budget agreement. The President expressed optimism that a responsible agreement can be reached if both sides negotiate in good faith and understand that compromises will be necessary. Staff will continue to meet daily on outstanding issues, and the President plans to check in with leaders by phone later in the week and meet with them upon his return from overseas.
