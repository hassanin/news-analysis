Vice President Kamala Harris has announced new commitments from the U.S. government, private sector companies, education and training providers, and philanthropic organizations to support space-related STEM initiatives. The goal is to inspire, prepare, and employ the next generation of the space workforce. The White House has released an Interagency Roadmap to Support Space-Related STEM Education and Workforce, which outlines coordinated actions to bolster the capacity to inspire, prepare, and employ a diverse space workforce. The Vice President has also announced a new coalition of space companies, including Blue Origin, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, that will focus on increasing the space industry's capacity to meet the demand for a skilled technical workforce. The coalition will launch regional pilot programs in Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi, and Southern California, and collaborate with service providers to attract, train, and create employment opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM jobs. Federal agencies and the private sector have also committed to inspiring youth, providing resources for educators, and ensuring diversity in the space workforce.
