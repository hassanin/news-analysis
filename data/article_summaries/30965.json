This article is a presidential memorandum issued by President Donald J. Trump on April 22, 2019, regarding immigration and visa overstay rates. The memorandum states that the administration is committed to securing the borders of the United States and enforcing the laws of the country. It highlights the high rates of visa overstays by nationals of certain countries and the negative impact it has on the immigration system and national interest. The memorandum directs the Secretary of State to engage with governments of countries with overstay rates greater than 10% and provide recommendations within 120 days to reduce overstay rates. It also calls for immediate actions to reduce overstay rates for all nonimmigrant visa categories and a summary of ongoing efforts to reduce overstays from countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program. Additionally, the memorandum instructs the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to develop measures for imposing admission bonds to improve compliance with visa terms and conditions. The memorandum concludes with general provisions, stating that it does not affect existing rights or obligations under international agreements and should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to appropriations. The Secretary of State is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
