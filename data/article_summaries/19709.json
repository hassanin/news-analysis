The White House is announcing its 2016 Spring Garden Tours, where visitors can explore the gardens and grounds of the White House. The tours will take place on April 16 and 17 and will include the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, Rose Garden, and South Lawn. Guests will also have the opportunity to visit the White House Kitchen Garden, which was established by Michelle Obama in 2009 to promote the health and wellbeing of the nation. The event is free and open to the public, but tickets are required. The National Park Service will distribute tickets on a first-come, first-served basis. There are certain items that are not allowed on the White House grounds, such as tablets, video recorders, bags, and pointed objects. However, strollers, wheelchairs, umbrellas, and cameras are permitted. In case of inclement weather, the event may be cancelled, so visitors are advised to check the status by calling the information line.
