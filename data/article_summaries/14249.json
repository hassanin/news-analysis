The article discusses President Obama's Blueprint for making the most of America's energy resources. The President emphasizes an all-of-the-above approach to energy, including the safe and responsible production of oil and natural gas. American oil production is currently at its highest level in eight years, and the country relied less on foreign oil last year than in the past 16 years.

However, the President also believes in doubling down on clean energy. Transitioning to cleaner sources of energy will enhance national security, protect the environment and public health, and grow the economy. Renewable energy use has nearly doubled in the past few years, and the United States has reclaimed its position as the world's leading investor in clean energy.

President Obama plans to promote American-made energy for a strong economy by visiting a UPS facility in Las Vegas and delivering remarks on American energy at Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora, Colorado.

The President's plan to advance safe production of oil and gas resources includes making a new lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico to develop offshore resources, promoting safe shale gas development, and reducing dependence on oil by encouraging greater use of natural gas in transportation. The plan also aims to harness American ingenuity to catalyze breakthrough technologies for natural gas.

In terms of clean energy, the President aims to double the share of electricity from clean energy sources by 2035 through a Clean Energy Standard (CES). He also supports targeted tax incentives for clean energy, opening public lands for private investments in clean energy, and securing renewable energy for the U.S. Navy.

Overall, President Obama's Blueprint for America's energy resources focuses on developing all available sources of energy, while also transitioning to cleaner sources, promoting job creation, enhancing energy security, and protecting the environment and public health.
