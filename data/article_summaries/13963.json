President Barack Obama sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate on August 4, 2014. In the letter, he designated all funding specified by Congress in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Resolution, 2014 as an emergency requirement. This designation was made in accordance with section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. The designated funding was for the "Department of Defense—Procurement—Procurement, Defense-Wide" account. The details of this action were provided in a memorandum from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
