On September 18, 2018, the President signed two laws. The first law, H.R. 5385, is called the "Dr. Benjy Frances Brooks Children's Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2018." This law extends and reauthorizes appropriations until fiscal year 2023 for payments to children's hospitals that have approved graduate medical residency training programs. The second law, H.R. 5772, designates the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, as the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse.
