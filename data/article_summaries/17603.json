The White House has announced that President Obama will deliver an address to the nation tomorrow night to outline his executive action on immigration. The President is expected to announce details of his plan to repair the broken immigration system, including measures to provide temporary relief from deportation to certain undocumented immigrants. The President will also travel to Las Vegas, Nevada on Friday to speak at Del Sol High School. Prior to the speech, the President will be hosting a dinner tonight for some Democrats from the House and Senate to discuss the immigration executive action, as well as other priorities. The White House expects strong opposition from Republicans, but is confident that the President's actions are legal and will have positive effects on national security, border security, and the economy. The President is open to discussions with Republicans on immigration reform, but is also prepared to move forward with executive action.
