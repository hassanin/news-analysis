The Biden-Harris Administration has launched a two-year competition called the "AI Cyber Challenge" (AIxCC) in partnership with leading AI companies Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, as well as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The competition aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to protect critical software that runs the internet and essential infrastructure in the United States. With nearly $20 million in prizes, the competition will drive the development of new technologies to enhance the security of computer code. DARPA will host an open competition, and the winner will receive a significant monetary prize. The competition is part of the administration's efforts to ensure responsible advancement of emerging technologies and protect Americans. Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration has secured commitments from leading AI companies to manage the risks associated with AI technology and is working on legislation to promote responsible AI innovation.
