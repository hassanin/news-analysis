The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has announced three funding opportunities aimed at helping states and communities prepare for major disasters and improve their ability to recover. These programs will provide nearly $5 billion to increase preparedness for climate-related extreme weather events and other disasters. The funding aligns with President Biden's Build Back Better Agenda, which includes investments in resilient infrastructure and the Justice40 Initiative, aiming to deliver at least 40% of climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities. Climate change has led to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, resulting in significant costs and damages. The underinvestment in American infrastructure has impacted resilience, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged communities. However, smart pre-disaster investments can reduce human and infrastructure costs. FEMA hazard mitigation investments have been shown to be cost-effective and result in safer and more resilient communities. These investments also create jobs in infrastructure building and improvement. The Biden Administration is committed to ensuring that underserved communities have access to these funds. FEMA has refined project selection criteria to benefit those most in need and is conducting equity assessments to address barriers and expand access for disadvantaged communities. The FEMA program will prioritize funding in disadvantaged communities using the Social Vulnerability Index and mapping assessment tools. The Biden Administration is taking a whole-of-government approach to increase resilience and address the needs of communities through various task forces and interagency working groups.
