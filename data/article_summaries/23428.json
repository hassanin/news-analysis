In this statement, the President discusses the ongoing efforts to contain the BP oil spill. He mentions that the drilling of relief wells, which is the surest way to stop the flow of oil, will take several months to complete. Therefore, engineers have been exploring alternative methods. The "top kill" approach, which was attempted this week, did not work. As a result, a new procedure will be implemented, involving cutting the riser pipe and fitting a containment structure over the leak. This approach is risky and has never been attempted at this depth before. The President emphasizes that every day the leak continues is detrimental to the people of the Gulf Coast region and their livelihoods. He pledges to continue pursuing all responsible means of stopping the leak until the completion of the relief wells and ensuring that those affected by the disaster are properly compensated.
