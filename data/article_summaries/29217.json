The March for Life Education and Defense Fund, founded by Nellie Gray, organized the 45th annual pro-life rally in Washington, D.C. President Trump and Vice President Pence showed their support through video satellite and a roundtable discussion with leaders from Students for Life. President Trump proclaimed January 22, 2018, as National Sanctity of Human Life Day. The Trump Administration has been working to change the conversation and policy landscape surrounding abortion, including overturning an Obama Administration rule that prohibited states from defunding abortion service providers. The March for Life aims to provide a platform for Americans to testify to the beauty of life and the dignity of each human person.
