A new law has taken effect in Texas that goes against the precedent set by Roe v. Wade. This law effectively bans abortion for the nearly 7 million reproductive-aged Texans, forcing patients to either travel out-of-state or continue their pregnancies against their will. Access to reproductive care will be significantly reduced, especially for low-income women and women of color. Additionally, the law includes a provision that allows private citizens to sue anyone who assists someone in getting an abortion. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to protecting healthcare access and defending a woman's right to make decisions about her body and future.
