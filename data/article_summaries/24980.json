President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 2013 as National Foster Care Month in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of ensuring that children grow up healthy and safe, particularly those in foster care who often lack the love, protection, and stability of a permanent family. The proclamation acknowledges the efforts of foster parents and professionals who work to support these children and highlights the decreasing number of young people in foster care and waiting for adoption. However, there are still more than 400,000 children searching for permanent homes. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe the month by assisting youth in foster care and recognizing the dedication of those who make a positive impact on their lives. The government will continue to invest in services that strengthen the foster care system, encourage adoption, and support programs that increase permanency and address the issues that lead young people into the child welfare system. The proclamation emphasizes that anyone can be a supportive adult for a child in need, whether as a friend, role model, or guardian.
