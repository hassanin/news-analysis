President Obama will host a White House Summit on Early Education on December 10. The summit aims to bring together various leaders and stakeholders committed to expanding access to high-quality early education. This initiative builds on the President's call in his 2013 State of the Union address to provide high-quality early childhood education for all children in America. The proposal includes investments in home visiting, early learning opportunities for young children, and preschool for all. More than 30 states and cities have already established new programs or expanded access to preschool since the President's call to action. Studies have shown that investing in early childhood education yields significant long-term benefits. During the summit, the President will announce $250 million in Preschool Development Grants and $500 million in Early Head Start Child Care Partnership awards to enhance and expand preschool programs and improve access to high-quality infant and toddler care. The President will also highlight new private sector commitments to expand children's early learning opportunities.
