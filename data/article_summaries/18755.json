This article is about Kayla Holmstrom, who contracted chronic osteomyelitis after a motorcycle accident when she was 9 years old. She has had over 25 surgeries on her leg and her infection could flare up at any time. However, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, she can stay on her parent's health insurance plan until her 26th birthday. Before the reform, many young adults struggled to get the care they needed, with a significant percentage losing or switching coverage and being uninsured for extended periods of time. The Affordable Care Act will help 1.2 million young adults remain on their parent's health insurance plan and provide additional protections for people with pre-existing conditions. It also aims to reduce the deficit by cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse in the healthcare system.
