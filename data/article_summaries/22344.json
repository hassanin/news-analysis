The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global initiative that aims to promote transparency, fight corruption, strengthen accountability, and empower citizens. It was launched in 2011 by a group of governments and civil society organizations from around the world. The partnership is led by the United States and Brazil, with a steering committee composed of governments and civil society organizations. The OGP encourages participating countries to develop and implement concrete action plans in consultation with their citizens. The partnership currently has eight founding governments and 38 additional governments that have committed to join. Each government has made specific commitments in areas such as fiscal transparency, freedom of information, and citizen engagement. The OGP will continue to expand and work towards meaningful reforms that increase government accountability and effectiveness.
