President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Alabama and has ordered federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in the area affected by severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in DeKalb and Marshall Counties, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to assist with recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis for state and eligible local governments and certain nonprofit organizations. W. Michael Moore has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance by registering online or calling the provided toll-free numbers.
