This article is a summary of the Executive Order issued by President Barack Obama on December 5, 2016, titled "Safeguarding the Nation from the Impacts of Invasive Species." The order aims to prevent the introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive species in the United States and to minimize the economic, environmental, and health impacts caused by these species. Invasive species pose threats to various aspects of society, including the environment, agriculture, water resources, and human health. The order amends a previous executive order and establishes the National Invasive Species Council to coordinate federal efforts in preventing and controlling invasive species. It also assigns duties to federal agencies to take necessary actions to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species, conduct research, promote public education, and coordinate with other entities. The order emphasizes the consideration of emerging priorities such as public health impacts, climate change, and technological innovation in addressing invasive species. The Council is tasked with developing a National Invasive Species Council Management Plan and publishing a report on its achievements annually. The order also allows for exemptions for actions related to foreign policy, readiness, or national security, and does not affect the obligations of the Department of Health and Human Services under other acts.
