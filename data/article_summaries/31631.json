On November 27, 2018, President Donald Trump issued executive orders regarding foreign policy. In the order, President Trump declares a national emergency in response to the situation in Nicaragua, including the violent response by the government to protests, the dismantling of democratic institutions, and the destabilization of the country's economy. The order blocks all property and interests in property in the United States belonging to individuals or entities involved in serious human rights abuses, actions that undermine democratic processes, actions that threaten the peace and stability of Nicaragua, or corruption related to the government. It also suspends the entry of aliens who meet the criteria outlined in the order, unless their entry is determined to be in the national interest. The order prohibits donations to individuals or entities whose property is blocked and includes provisions to prevent transactions that evade the order. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to implement the order. The order does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, nor does it create any enforceable rights or benefits.
