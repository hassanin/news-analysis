The pandemic is receding in the US, leading to increased travel this Memorial Day weekend. Gas prices are currently lower than the average over the past 15 years and similar to prices in May 2018 and May 2019. The successful handling of the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have resulted in higher demand for gas. While prices have increased from last year's lows, they are still in line with recent decades, at around $3 per gallon. Prices have stabilized after a recent spike, thanks to the full restoration of the Colonial Pipeline and the administration's response to the shutdown. President Biden recognizes that gas prices are a concern for Americans, particularly middle-class families, and opposes any proposals to raise the gas tax. The administration will continue to monitor prices and is pleased that Americans can travel again.
