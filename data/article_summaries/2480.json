Jennifer Klein, White House Gender Policy Council Director, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, and Danielle Conley, Deputy White House Counsel, hosted a roundtable discussion with Florida reproductive rights advocates and elected leaders. The discussion focused on Florida's House Bill 5, which restricts access to abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The bill is expected to become law soon. During the meeting, Florida leaders shared their efforts opposing the bill and discussed steps to support women's access to reproductive health care. The Administration officials expressed their support for Floridians' reproductive rights and discussed the nationwide trend of state laws restricting access to reproductive health care. Over 265 bills restricting access to abortion have been filed during the 2022 legislative session. The officials reaffirmed the Administration's commitment to protecting reproductive health care and exploring all options to do so. President Biden also addressed the issue in his State of the Union address, highlighting the threat to the constitutional right affirmed by Roe v. Wade and reiterating his commitment to protecting women's access to health care.
