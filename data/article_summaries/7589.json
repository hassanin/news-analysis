President Biden has vetoed H.J. Res. 39, a resolution that would disapprove the Department of Commerce's rule on "Procedures Covering Suspension of Liquidation, Duties and Estimated Duties in Accord With Presidential Proclamation 10414." The President believes that the United States has been too reliant on China for solar energy products due to unfair trade practices and underinvestment in domestic manufacturing. His administration has been working to create a strong solar supply chain in America, resulting in the announcement of 51 new and expanded solar equipment manufacturing plants since he took office. The President's Investing in America agenda has also led to commitments from private companies to build enough solar panel manufacturing capacity to power nearly six million homes. The Department of Commerce's rule supports American businesses and workers in the solar industry, ensuring sufficient, clean, and reliable electricity for American families while holding trading partners accountable. The rule provides a temporary, 24-month bridge to support the deployment of American-made solar products once the new factories are operational. President Biden does not intend to extend the tariff suspension beyond the 2-year period in June 2024. He argues that passing the resolution would undermine American innovation, create uncertainty for businesses and workers in the solar industry, and therefore, he is vetoing it.
