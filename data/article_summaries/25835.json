President Donald J. Trump met with the National Economic Council (NEC) staff to discuss his economic growth agenda and welcome new NEC Director Larry Kudlow. The economy is reportedly booming under President Trump, with GDP for the fourth quarter revised up to 2.9 percent. Over four million American workers have received pay raises, bonuses, or other benefits from Trump's tax cuts. Three million jobs have been created since his election, and unemployment remains at a sixteen-year low of 4.1 percent. Larry Kudlow and the NEC team aim to continue building on these successes to raise wages and create jobs across the country. The President also thanked outgoing NEC Director Gary Cohn for his service.
