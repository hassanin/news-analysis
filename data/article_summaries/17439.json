President Barack Obama has issued a presidential memorandum in which he withholds his approval of H.R. 3808, the "Interstate Recognition of Notarizations Act of 2010." The president expresses concern about the possible unintended impact of the bill on consumer protections, particularly in relation to mortgages. He states that further deliberations are necessary before the bill can be finalized. President Obama acknowledges that the authors of the bill had good intentions in mind, aiming to remove obstacles to interstate commerce. He assures that his administration will collaborate with them and other congressional leaders to explore alternative ways to achieve this objective. To make it clear that he is vetoing the bill, the president is withholding his signature and returning H.R. 3808, along with the Memorandum of Disapproval, to the Clerk of the House of Representatives.
