Vice President Joe Biden has outlined plans for funding smart grid initiatives in the United States. The Department of Energy will distribute over $3.3 billion in smart grid technology development grants and an additional $615 million for smart grid storage, monitoring, and technology viability. The goal is to create a strong, secure, and efficient electrical grid that will lower utility bills, reduce dependence on foreign oil, and create jobs. The funding will support the development of industry-wide standards and the integration of renewable energy sources with the electrical grid. The Department of Energy has released a Notice of Intent for the Smart Grid Investment Grant Program and a draft Funding Opportunity Announcement for a smart grid regional demonstration initiative. The program will provide grants for smart grid technology deployments and grid monitoring devices, with a 50% matching grant for investments by electric utilities and other entities. The draft announcement also includes funding for smart grid demonstrations in areas such as smart grid regional demonstrations, utility-scale energy storage, and grid monitoring. Each demonstration project must be carried out in collaboration with the electric utility that owns the grid facilities, and a cost share of at least 50% of non-federal funds is required. The draft announcement will be open for comment for 20 days.
