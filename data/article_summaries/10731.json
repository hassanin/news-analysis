President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Alaska and has ordered federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in the area affected by a severe storm on August 27, 2015. The federal funding will be available to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The funding will also be available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Thomas J. Dargan has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments.
