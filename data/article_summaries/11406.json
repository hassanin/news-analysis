In this memorandum, President Barack Obama expresses his disapproval of S.J. Res. 8, a resolution that aims to overturn the National Labor Relations Board's "representation case procedures" rule. The rule in question introduces reforms to simplify and streamline private sector union elections. The President argues that workers need a strong voice in the workplace to protect and grow the middle class, and unions have historically played a vital role in giving workers that voice. He believes that workers deserve a fair and streamlined process for determining whether to have unions as their bargaining representative. As a result, he is withholding his approval of the resolution and returning it to the Secretary of the Senate as a veto.
