President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 with respect to Zimbabwe will continue beyond March 6, 2020. The national emergency was initially declared in 2003 to address actions and policies of certain members of the Zimbabwean government and other individuals that undermine the country's democratic processes and institutions. Despite opportunities for Zimbabwe to implement reforms, President Emmerson Mnangagwa's administration has not shown credible political will to do so. The government has been accused of persecuting critics and mismanaging the economy, with reports of extrajudicial killings, rapes, and abductions by security forces. These actions and policies are seen as posing an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States.
