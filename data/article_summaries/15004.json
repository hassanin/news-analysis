Today, the President will be in Seattle, Washington, where he will meet with a local family before hosting a discussion on women and the economy with families and women small business owners from the area. The President will talk about the impact of the recession on women and how his Administration's policies will continue to benefit them as the country recovers from the recession. The National Economic Council also released a report on the impact of the recession on women and how the Administration's economic policies benefit American women. The President will highlight this report at the event. The host family for the event is the Foss family, who have two children and have been married for 14 years. Erik Foss is a general contractor, and Cynnie Foss is the Volunteer Services Manager at the University of Washington Medical Center. Two women small business owners, Jody Hall and Christina Lomasney, will also be in attendance. Jody Hall is the owner of Cupcake Royale, a popular bakery with multiple locations in Seattle. Christina Lomasney is the President and CEO of Modumetal, a nanostructured metals manufacturer. The event is expected to be attended by Governor Chris Gregoire, Senator Patty Murray, Representative Jim McDermott, and Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn.
