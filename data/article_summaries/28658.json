According to a survey by Gallup, public optimism in their personal economy has reached a 16-year high under President Trump. The survey found that 69% of respondents expect their personal finances to be even better next year, just shy of the record 71% during the internet boom under former President Bill Clinton. Additionally, 50% of respondents believe they are "better off" than they were a year ago, marking the first time this level has been reached since 2007. This increase in optimism about personal finances is the highest it has been in over 16 years.
