President Obama and the First Lady will be traveling to Cuba on March 21st and 22nd and Argentina on March 23rd and 24th. In Cuba, the President will focus on strengthening the progress made towards normalizing relations with Cuba, including advancing commercial and people-to-people ties and expressing support for human rights. He will have a bilateral meeting with Cuban President Raul Castro and engage with members of civil society, entrepreneurs, and Cubans from different backgrounds. This visit is significant as it is the first by a sitting U.S. President in nearly 90 years, demonstrating the President's commitment to forging a new path for U.S.-Cuban relations. 

In Argentina, the President and First Family will meet with the new Argentine President, Mauricio Macri, to discuss his reform agenda and recognize his contributions to human rights in the region. The President will also work towards increasing cooperation between the two governments in areas such as trade and investment, renewable energy and climate change, and citizen security. This visit is notable as it is the first bilaterally focused visit by a U.S. President to Argentina in almost two decades.
