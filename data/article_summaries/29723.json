The article discusses an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on May 1, 2017, establishing the American Technology Council (ATC). The purpose of the ATC is to promote the secure, efficient, and economical use of information technology in achieving the missions of the United States. The council consists of various government officials, including the President, Vice President, Secretaries of Defense, Commerce, and Homeland Security, and other key members. The ATC's principal functions include coordinating the vision, strategy, and direction for the federal government's use of information technology and advising the President on related policies. The ATC may function through ad hoc committees, task forces, or interagency groups, and agencies are encouraged to cooperate and provide assistance to the council. The order also specifies that the ATC's functions do not extend to national security systems and that it will terminate on January 20, 2021. The order emphasizes that it does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies, the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), or the provisions of a previous Presidential Memorandum.
