Vice President Mike Pence wrote an op-ed discussing the importance of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in securing American leadership in the auto industry. He visited the Ford Rouge complex, which has been producing cars for over a century, and highlighted the role of technology such as robotics, 3D printing, and virtual reality in developing the next generation of American cars. Pence emphasized the need for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals to ensure American autoworkers can compete on a level playing field. He argued that the USMCA is necessary because the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is outdated and contains provisions that work against American interests.
