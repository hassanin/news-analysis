President Biden has announced his intention to appoint several individuals to serve as members on the President's Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities. The committee serves as a federal advisor to the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services on matters related to individuals with intellectual disabilities. The committee consists of 21 citizen members who serve two-year terms. The appointed individuals reflect the diversity of America and include people with intellectual disabilities, their family members, researchers, service providers, professionals, community and business representatives, and systems advocates. Some of the appointed members include Shawn Aleong, a young African American man with cerebral palsy and an intellectual disability; Paul Aronsohn, New Jersey's statewide Ombudsman for Individuals with Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities and Their Families; and Lucy Meyer, an international advocate for young people with disabilities.
