President Donald J. Trump has released two national strategies aimed at combating terrorist travel and enhancing aviation security. These strategies prioritize the responsibilities of various departments and agencies and aim to prevent terrorists from crossing borders and improve security in the aviation sector. The National Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel aims to modernize the US approach to countering evolving terrorist threats, while the National Strategy for Aviation Security provides a comprehensive framework for protecting American aviation from recognized threats. These strategies address longstanding security challenges, strengthen border security, improve immigration law enforcement, and enhance transportation security both domestically and internationally. These strategies are the first of their kind in over a decade and demonstrate President Trump's commitment to keeping America safe.
