President Donald J. Trump has issued an Executive Order to block the property of the Government of Venezuela. This action is in response to the continued usurpation of power by the illegitimate Nicolas Maduro regime, as well as their human rights abuses, arbitrary arrest and detention of Venezuelan citizens, curtailment of free press, and attempts to undermine Interim President Juan Guaido and the democratically-elected Venezuelan National Assembly. The Executive Order is issued under various acts, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the National Emergencies Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code.
