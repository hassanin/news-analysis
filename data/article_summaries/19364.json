The President has signed into law S. 2195, which concerns visa limitations for certain representatives to the United Nations. The law states that individuals who have been found to have engaged in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States or its allies, and who may pose a threat to national security interests, may not be admitted to the United States as representatives to the United Nations. However, the President also notes that this law could potentially interfere with his constitutional authority to receive or reject foreign ambassadors, and therefore he will continue to treat it as advisory in such cases.
