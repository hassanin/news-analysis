The statement by White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer highlights the importance of preventing a tax increase on 160 million Americans. The deal announced is seen as a step towards enacting a key provision of the President's American Jobs Act and is seen as a victory for the American people and the economy. Failing to extend this tax cut would have had a damaging effect on the recovery and job growth, according to independent analysts. The President urges Congress to finish their business for the American people.
