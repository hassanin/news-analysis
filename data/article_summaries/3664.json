Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation John Podesta, Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy Council Neera Tanden, Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Rachel Levine, and other Biden-Harris Administration officials recently met with health care providers, professional societies, philanthropies, and financial institutions to discuss how health care organizations can benefit from the opportunities in the Inflation Reduction Act. The officials highlighted the importance of supporting safety-net health organizations, which serve populations affected by climate change-related health threats, and emphasized that this support is central to the Administration's goals of advancing health equity, increasing access to affordable, quality health care, and protecting the health and well-being of all Americans. They mentioned that the energy efficiency and renewable energy investments made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act can help these organizations decrease operating costs, free up resources for patient services, and make them more resilient. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also announced that its Office of Climate Change and Health Equity will lead a program in 2024 to help safety-net health care organizations take advantage of the tax credits and grant programs created by the Inflation Reduction Act. The program will involve national webinars and breakout sessions to help organizations assess their needs, learn about the opportunities provided by the Act, and successfully utilize them. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to partnering with safety-net health care organizations and the broader health sector to protect communities, promote sustainability, and save on energy bills through the Inflation Reduction Act.
