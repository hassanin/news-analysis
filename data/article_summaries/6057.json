President Biden and Prime Minister Modi of India held the fourth U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue. They pledged to strengthen the U.S.-India relationship through collaboration in areas such as clean energy, technology, military cooperation, and expanding economic and people-to-people ties. Both leaders also committed to working together, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, enhance global health security, promote global food security, and ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. They emphasized their shared commitment to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations. The leaders also discussed the destabilizing effects of Russia's war against Ukraine, particularly regarding the global food supply. They expressed anticipation for an in-person meeting later this spring in Tokyo for the Quad summit.
