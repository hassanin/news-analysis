In this press conference, President Obama addresses the ongoing government shutdown and debt ceiling crisis. He criticizes the Republicans for using threats of a government shutdown and economic chaos to try to negotiate their demands. He argues that negotiations should not require such threats and that the American people should not be held hostage. He also emphasizes that the United States has always paid its bills and defaulting would have severe consequences for the economy. He discusses the impact of the shutdown on various sectors, such as small businesses, farmers, and national parks. He argues that the Republicans' strategy is not based on compromise and that Democrats are willing to talk about any issues. He mentions the possibility of a short-term budget to reopen the government and extend the debt ceiling, but notes that it should not be used as a way to avoid addressing the core issues. He also discusses the importance of addressing the issue of campaign finance and the influence of money in politics. Finally, he talks about the US military operations in Africa and the need to address terrorism in the region. Overall, he emphasizes the need for compromise and the negative consequences of the current crisis.
