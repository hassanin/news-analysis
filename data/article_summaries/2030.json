President Biden is vetoing a resolution, S.J.Res. 38, that would disapprove of an action by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) relating to the waiver of Buy America requirements for electric vehicle (EV) chargers. The resolution aims to eliminate domestic manufacturing standards for EV chargers funded by the FHWA, which the President argues would harm domestic manufacturing and American jobs. If enacted, it would weaken Buy America requirements and allow federal dollars to be spent on chargers made in competitor nations like China. The resolution would also undermine private sector investments in domestic EV charging manufacturing and efforts to ensure that the national network of EV chargers must be manufactured in the United States. The President claims that the resolution would hinder efforts to encourage investment in critical industries and bring high-quality jobs back to the United States. Therefore, he is vetoing the resolution.
