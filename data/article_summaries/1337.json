The United States supports the European Union's efforts to integrate the Western Balkans into the Euro-Atlantic community by opening EU accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia. Amid Russia's disruptions to peace in Europe, it is crucial to support the vision of a united, free, and peaceful Europe. The US will remain a strong partner in defending human rights, promoting democratic reforms, and upholding the rule of law in the Western Balkans. The recent actions taken by the EU, Albania, and North Macedonia should encourage other countries in the region to further strengthen their democracies.
