This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump, aims to expand access to workplace retirement plans for American workers. The order highlights the fact that a significant percentage of workers lack access to retirement plans, particularly those employed by small businesses. The order emphasizes the need to reduce regulatory burdens and complexity that deter employers from offering retirement plans. It proposes expanding access to multiple employer plans (MEPs) as a way to reduce administrative costs and encourage more employers to establish retirement plans. The order also suggests reducing the number and complexity of employee benefit plan notices and disclosures to ease regulatory burdens. Additionally, it calls for a review of outdated distribution mandates that may leave retirees with insufficient savings. The order provides instructions for the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of the Treasury to consider proposed rulemaking and guidance to implement these initiatives.
