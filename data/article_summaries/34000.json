During a press briefing, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Department of Justice would enforce immigration laws and crack down on sanctuary cities. He urged states and local jurisdictions to comply with federal immigration laws and threatened to withhold grants from those that do not. Sessions cited cases of undocumented immigrants who committed serious crimes after being released by sanctuary cities. He also mentioned that the Trump administration is still working on repealing and replacing Obamacare, and that tax reform is a priority. Additionally, he spoke about the recent meeting between President Trump and the Congressional Black Caucus, and mentioned the establishment of the Office of American Innovation, led by Jared Kushner. There was also discussion about the recent visit of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes to the White House to view documents related to the Russia investigation. The press briefing ended with a question about hate crimes, to which Spicer responded that the President condemns hate crimes and that they have no place in the country.
