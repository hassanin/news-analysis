The White House has released a report called "Creating Pathways to Opportunity," which highlights the work done by the Obama Administration to help underserved communities and strengthen the middle class. The report outlines the investments made to lift Americans out of poverty, provide support to families during the economic downturn, and invest in long-term reforms for the middle class. It also discusses the impact of the American Jobs Act on underserved communities. The report includes success stories from around the country. The Obama Administration has taken various actions to help vulnerable Americans and strengthen the economy, including tax relief for working Americans, expanded unemployment benefits and nutrition assistance, programs to keep Americans in their homes during the housing crisis, reforms in K-12 education and early education, increased college access and affordability, subsidized jobs for low-income adults and youth, creation of economically-sustainable neighborhoods, support for small businesses in low-income areas, expanded health care access, and the proposed American Jobs Act to put more Americans back to work. The American Jobs Act includes support for small businesses, job creation, expansion of job opportunities for low-income individuals, support for out-of-work Americans, and putting more money in the pockets of working and middle-class Americans.
