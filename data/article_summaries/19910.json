President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan will continue beyond November 3, 2015. This emergency was declared in 1997 and expanded in 2006 due to the actions and policies of the Sudanese government, which pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The crisis has not been resolved, hence the decision to continue the national emergency.
