President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to revoke Executive Order 13495, which required that successor federal contractors offer a right of first refusal of employment to employees under the predecessor contract. The Secretary of Labor, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, and heads of executive departments and agencies are instructed to promptly rescind any orders, rules, regulations, guidelines, programs, or policies implementing or enforcing the revoked order. The Secretary of Labor is also directed to terminate any investigations or compliance actions based on the revoked order. The order does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments, agencies, or their heads, nor does it impact the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
