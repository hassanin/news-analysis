President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13667 regarding the Central African Republic will continue beyond May 12, 2016. The situation in the Central African Republic, characterized by lawlessness, sectarian tension, violence, atrocities, and the use of child soldiers, poses a threat to the peace, security, and stability of the country and neighboring states. President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency to address these issues.
