President Donald Trump issued a proclamation declaring March 1 to March 7, 2020, as National Consumer Protection Week. In the proclamation, he highlights the revitalization of the United States economy and the benefits that Americans have experienced. He emphasizes the need to remain vigilant against scammers who exploit and deceive honest people. The proclamation mentions the tactics used by these criminals, such as falsely claiming to be affiliated with government agencies and tricking people into giving away money or personal information. President Trump advises individuals to not trust caller ID and to contact the real agency on their own. He also mentions the actions taken by his administration to protect consumers, such as establishing the Task Force on Market Integrity and Consumer Fraud and signing legislation allowing consumers to freeze their credit reports for free. The proclamation calls for government agencies, industry representatives, community groups, and consumer organizations to work together to protect consumers and encourages individuals to utilize available resources to safeguard their personal and financial information.
