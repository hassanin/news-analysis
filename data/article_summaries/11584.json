The White House has announced that nearly $1 billion in Recovery Act awards will be given to health care providers to advance the adoption and meaningful use of health information technology (IT) and train workers for future health care jobs. This investment aims to make health IT available to over 100,000 hospitals and primary care physicians by 2014 and train thousands of people for careers in health care and information technology. The grants will support the development of state-level health information exchange (HIE) and regional extension centers (RECs) to facilitate the adoption and use of electronic health records (EHRs). The Department of Labor will also provide grants to train 15,000 people in job skills needed for health care, IT, and other high-growth fields. This investment is expected to support tens of thousands of jobs in the health IT industry.
