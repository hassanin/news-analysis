On October 21, 1995, President Trump declared a national emergency regarding significant narcotics traffickers in Colombia. This declaration was made to address the threat these traffickers pose to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, as well as the extreme violence, corruption, and harm they cause domestically and internationally. The President states that these actions continue to pose a threat and therefore, he is extending the national emergency for an additional year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This announcement will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
