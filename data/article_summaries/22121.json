President Barack Obama commends the introduction of legislation by Chairmen Baucus and Rangel, and Senator Kerry and Congressman Neal, to crack down on Americans hiding their assets in overseas tax havens. He believes that a small number of individuals and businesses use these tax havens to shirk their responsibilities, while the majority of hard-working Americans fulfill their obligations. The President had previously proposed measures to combat illegal overseas tax evasion, and he hopes that this legislation will put a stop to billions of dollars worth of abuses. He looks forward to working with Congress to turn these proposals into law and relieve honest Americans from shouldering the burden caused by those who prioritize profit over responsibility.
