The Biden-Harris Administration is highlighting progress made in ensuring equal opportunities for all Americans to build generational wealth through homeownership. One year ago, the administration's Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) released the PAVE Action Plan, which aimed to address bias in home appraisals that disproportionately affected Black and brown families. In the past year, the PAVE Task Force has made significant strides in implementing the Action Plan, including empowering consumers with tools to combat appraisal bias, using data to identify trends and offenders, and supporting a well-trained appraiser profession. The Action Plan is in response to real harm caused by appraisal bias, as exemplified by the story of Tenisha Tate-Austin, whose home was appraised significantly higher after a white friend stood in for her family. The Biden-Harris Administration has also launched a portal, pave.hud.gov/gethelp, where consumers can learn about their rights and file discrimination complaints related to racial bias in home appraisals.
