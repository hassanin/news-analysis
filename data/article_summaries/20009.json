President Obama has signed an emergency declaration for the State of New Hampshire due to severe storm conditions that occurred in October 2011. This declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate disaster relief efforts to help the local population affected by the emergency. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency, with 75 percent of the funding coming from the federal government. Albert Lewis has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. For further information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
