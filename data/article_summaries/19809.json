President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Colorado and authorized federal aid to assist in recovery efforts after severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in Boulder County, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Michael J. Hall has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated after assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free numbers will operate seven days a week until further notice.
