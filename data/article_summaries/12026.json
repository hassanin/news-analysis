This article is a fact sheet about a tax agreement reached by the White House in 2013. The agreement focuses on keeping income taxes low for the middle class and growing the economy. It includes measures such as extending the middle-class tax cuts, credits for working families, and unemployment insurance benefits. It also extends tax cuts for working families and students, renewable energy incentives, and business incentives. The agreement postpones the sequester for two months and raises $620 billion in revenue from the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. It restores tax rates for high-income households to Clinton-era levels and reduces tax benefits for households making over $250,000. The agreement also raises the tax rate on wealthy estates and cuts the deficit over the next five years. It establishes a foundation for further deficit reduction through tax and entitlement reform. Additionally, the agreement extends the farm bill to avoid a rise in milk prices.
