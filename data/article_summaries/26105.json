On January 3, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order revoking Executive Order 13799 of May 11, 2017, which established the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. This effectively terminates the commission. The order states that it does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also clarifies that the order must be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to available appropriations. Additionally, the order does not create any rights or benefits that can be enforced against the United States or any other party.
