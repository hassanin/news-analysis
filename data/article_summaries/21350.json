This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in December 2012. The order established the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force in response to the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall in October 2012. The task force was created to coordinate and support the long-term rebuilding efforts in the affected region, particularly in New York and New Jersey. The task force consists of representatives from various government departments and agencies, and its purpose is to identify opportunities for rebuilding success and ensure that the federal government provides the necessary resources for the region's recovery. The task force is also responsible for developing a rebuilding strategy within 180 days of its formation, which includes a long-term plan, specific goals and actions, and a monitoring plan. The article also mentions the establishment of a Task Force Advisory Group, which includes elected officials from the affected region. The task force is set to terminate 60 days after the completion of the rebuilding strategy.
