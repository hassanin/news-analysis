The White House Press Secretary released a statement regarding the Congressional Budget Office's score of the Senate's bipartisan immigration reform bill. The CBO estimated that the bill would reduce the deficit by $197 billion over the next 10 years and by about $700 billion over the following decade. The CBO also stated that the bill would increase economic growth in the long term. Additionally, the Social Security Administration's Chief Actuary previously analyzed the bill and concluded that it would strengthen the long-term solvency of Social Security. The statement emphasizes that passing immigration reform would not only benefit the economy and reduce the deficit but also improve the fiscal outlook, strengthen the middle class, and create new opportunities for Americans.
