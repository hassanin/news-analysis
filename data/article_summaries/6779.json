During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki discussed several topics. First, she announced that the Biden-Harris administration has launched Child Tax Credit Awareness Day to promote the largest Child Tax Credit in history. The American Rescue Plan increased the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 for families with children between 6 and 17 years old, and $3,600 for families with children under 6 years old. Starting July 15th, most eligible families will receive monthly payments automatically. Psaki encouraged all eligible individuals to visit ChildTaxCredit.gov to learn more and sign up.

Psaki also mentioned that the United States, along with its allies, has taken actions to impose costs on the Lukashenko regime in Belarus for various abuses. The Department of State and the Department of Treasury designated 62 individuals and 5 entities in response to ongoing repression in Belarus.

Additionally, Psaki announced the distribution list for the remaining 55 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines that the Biden administration has pledged to send globally. The administration has already sent millions of doses and is committed to working with manufacturers to produce more doses for global distribution. Psaki also mentioned the purchase of half a billion Pfizer doses to donate to low- and middle-income countries.

During the briefing, Psaki addressed questions about infrastructure negotiations, voting rights, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and other topics. She reiterated the administration's commitment to finding a bipartisan path forward on infrastructure and its support for voting rights. Psaki also mentioned that the President's stance on abortion is personal and that he respects a woman's right to choose.
