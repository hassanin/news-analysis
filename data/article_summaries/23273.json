On September 24, 2009, the White House released a fact sheet titled "Creating a 21st Century International Economic Architecture." The fact sheet highlights the need for changes in the global architecture for economic cooperation to reflect the dramatic changes in the world economy. The G-20 leaders reached an agreement to make the G-20 the premier forum for international economic cooperation. This decision aims to build a stronger, more balanced global economy, reform the financial system, and improve the lives of the poorest. The fact sheet also mentions the expansion of the Financial Stability Board to include all G-20 countries and the addition of all G-20 members to the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information. These institutions play important roles in developing and implementing global regulation reforms and promoting greater tax transparency.
