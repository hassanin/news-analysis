President Joe Biden convened a meeting of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) to discuss ongoing efforts to address key science and technology priorities and drive innovation in America. The President emphasized the importance of science-based decision making in tackling challenges such as the pandemic and climate change, as well as restoring trust in government through scientific integrity. PCAST Co-Chairs outlined four key areas of focus, including assessing and protecting against climate change risks, strengthening wildfire detection and response, reimagining the public health system, and maintaining America's global leadership in science and technology. PCAST members provided expertise and updates on their work in these areas. The next public virtual meeting of PCAST will be held on March 24-25, 2022.
