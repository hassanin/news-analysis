The White House, led by First Lady Michelle Obama, will host a convening about food marketing to children. The goal is to create a constructive dialogue and collaborative process to develop solutions that promote healthier choices for children. The convening will include key stakeholders such as food and media industry executives, advocates, parent leaders, government agency representatives, and researchers. The First Lady will call on stakeholders to leverage the power of marketing to promote healthy products and decrease the marketing of unhealthy products to kids. This event follows the First Lady's recent participation in the Partnership for a Healthier America's "Drink Up" campaign, which promotes water as the healthiest choice.
