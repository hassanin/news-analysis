This article is a memorandum from President Barack Obama regarding the Long-Term Gulf Coast Restoration Support Plan. The memorandum acknowledges that the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is the worst environmental disaster in American history and outlines the need for a long-term plan to restore the region. The Secretary of the Navy is assigned the responsibility of leading the effort to create this plan, in coordination with various stakeholders such as states, local communities, tribes, and businesses. The plan should assess the post-spill needs and propose federal assistance for the overall recovery of the Gulf Coast region. It should focus on economic recovery, community planning, science-based restoration of the ecosystem, public health and safety, and support for individuals and businesses affected by the spill. The plan should also consider existing resources and complement ongoing oil spill response efforts. The memorandum also mentions that executive branch components should provide necessary information and resources to assist in developing the plan. The provisions of the memorandum are subject to the availability of appropriations and should be carried out within the statutory and regulatory authorities of the executive branch components. It clarifies that the memorandum does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States and does not relieve the obligations of any responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act or other applicable law. The Secretary is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
