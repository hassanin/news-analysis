Vice President Kamala Harris has announced a new rule from the Labor Department (DOL) that aims to ensure infrastructure investments in America lead to good-paying jobs. The rule, which aligns with President Biden's economic vision, will raise wage standards for construction workers by updating prevailing wage regulations. This will benefit the 84% of construction workers who do not have a college degree. The rule will mean thousands of extra dollars per year for workers, allowing them to save for a home, retirement, or have more financial security. The DOL's new rule will update the prevailing wage definition, making it equivalent to the wage paid to at least 30% of workers in a given trade, rather than 50%. It will also make it easier to keep prevailing wages up to date and strengthen DOL enforcement. The rule comes as inflation has fallen, and infrastructure investments have been credited with keeping the economy strong.
