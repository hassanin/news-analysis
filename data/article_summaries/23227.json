Prince William, The Duke of Cambridge, will be visiting Washington, DC on December 8.

The purpose of his visit is to deliver remarks at the World Bank, where he will discuss efforts to combat illegal wildlife trafficking. The President appreciates Prince William's work in this area, as it is a national security threat and a significant environmental problem. The visit highlights the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom, and the President looks forward to thanking Prince William for the hospitality shown to him by the Royal Family during his recent visits to the UK.
