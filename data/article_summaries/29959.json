President Trump's support for the proposed Senate immigration reform bill, known as the "Raise Act," is seen as a return to policy sanity rather than an attack on immigrants. The current U.S. immigration policy is criticized for its focus on diversity and family criteria, which has resulted in the admission of individuals who do not possess the necessary skills or education to contribute to the economy. The policy also tolerates illegal immigration, leading to estimates of 12 to 30 million undocumented immigrants in the country. The Raise Act aims to reform the legal side of immigration by implementing a point-based system similar to those in Britain, Canada, and Australia. The Act, in combination with other policies to reduce illegal immigration, such as cracking down on Sanctuary Cities and deporting criminal aliens, aims to prioritize highly qualified individuals who can contribute to the high-tech economy, while easing pressure on low-skilled jobs. The overall goal is to fix an immigration system that has been broken for decades.
