Phoenix, Arizona has launched one of the first Registered Apprenticeship programs in support of the booming semiconductor and advanced manufacturing industries. This program is part of President Biden's Investing in America agenda, which includes various private and public investments aimed at creating pathways into good jobs. The program has received a $5 million commitment from the private sector to establish a new semiconductor technician apprenticeship program. Additionally, philanthropic organizations have committed $5 million to provide supportive services to 1,500 Arizonans seeking jobs in the future. Unions and community colleges have also formed new partnerships to expand access to apprenticeship and credentialing programs. Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, Arizona has seen over $77 billion in private investments in various sectors, including semiconductors, clean energy, and biomanufacturing. In response to this investment, the state is rapidly expanding workforce pathways into advanced manufacturing to meet the demand for talent in these sectors. The Phoenix region is now home to Arizona's first semiconductor apprenticeship programs, and the city's workforce board is the first to sponsor a Registered Apprenticeship program in this industry. This initiative aligns with the Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Sprint, a nationwide effort to build a diverse and skilled pipeline of workers for advanced manufacturing jobs.
