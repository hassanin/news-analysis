The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a fact sheet on the G-20's shared commitment to fighting corruption. The G-20 leaders have released an Action Plan to strengthen anti-corruption efforts worldwide. The plan is built around three pillars: a common approach to building an effective global anti-corruption regime, specific commitments to show collective leadership in high priority areas, and a commitment to engaging the private sector in supporting a clean business environment. The United States believes that the challenge is not in figuring out what needs to be done but in summoning the political will to embrace existing instruments and standards and effectively implement them. Under the Action Plan, G-20 leaders have agreed to lead by example in key areas such as ratifying and implementing the UN Convention against Corruption, adopting and enforcing laws against bribery of foreign public officials, preventing corrupt officials from accessing the global financial system, and protecting whistleblowers. The fact sheet also highlights the U.S. leadership in combating corruption, including increased enforcement efforts, denying safe haven to corrupt officials, developing international standards, and building the capacity of other governments to tackle corruption. The U.S. has also promoted public-private partnerships against corruption, including efforts in business education and awareness, supporting transparency in the extractive industries sector, and passing a law requiring reporting of payments by oil, gas, and mining companies.
