Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer, and Matt Rogers, Senior Advisor to Energy Secretary Chu, will hold a press conference call to preview the President's upcoming trip to Holland, Michigan. During the call, they will discuss a new Department of Energy report that details how Recovery Act investments are creating jobs and supporting the development of the domestic advanced battery and electric vehicle industry. The call will also highlight the groundbreaking of the new Compact Power plant in Holland, which is the ninth of nine new advanced battery plants to start construction as a result of $2.4 billion in Recovery Act grants. Compact Power, a subsidiary of LG Chem, will use its $151 million grant to build a new plant that will manufacture advanced batteries for the Chevy Volt and the new electric Ford Focus. The press conference call will take place today at 4:00 p.m. EDT, and reporters can join by dialing (800) 288-8967 and asking to join the "Batteries Call."
