First Lady Michelle Obama will be delivering her final remarks as First Lady at the 2017 School Counselor of the Year event on January 6th.

Before the First Lady's remarks, there will be a panel discussion featuring Education Secretary John B. King Jr., former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, actress Connie Britton, 2016 School Counselor of the Year Katherine Pastor, and First-Generation Baltimore Founder Verlando Brown.
