President Obama has declared a major disaster in Kentucky due to severe storms, flooding, and mudslides that occurred in July 2010. Federal aid will be provided to supplement recovery efforts in the affected area, specifically Pike County. This assistance includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid individuals and business owners in recovering from the disaster. Federal funding will also be available for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities, as well as for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Douglas G. Mayne has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are ongoing in other areas, and additional counties may receive assistance based on the assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by calling the provided toll-free numbers. For more information, contact FEMA.
