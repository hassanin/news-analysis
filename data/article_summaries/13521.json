Top officials, Chief Economist Jared Bernstein and Senior Advisor Matt Rogers, will hold a conference call with reporters to preview President Obama's trip to the Solyndra plant in Fremont, CA. The President is expected to highlight the Recovery Act loan guarantee for Solyndra, as well as recent news regarding Tesla and the NUMMI plant, and the Administration's efforts to create jobs and strengthen the economy. Tomorrow, President Obama will tour the Solyndra plant and make remarks about jobs and the economy. The Department of Energy offered a $535 million loan guarantee to Solyndra to support the construction of a commercial-scale manufacturing plant, creating over 3,000 construction-related jobs. The new factory is estimated to create as many as 1,000 long-term jobs, with additional jobs in installation of solar panels. Solyndra also exports its solar technology to foreign customers. Reporters can join the conference call by dialing (800) 288-8975 and asking to join the "White House Call."
