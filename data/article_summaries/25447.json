President Donald J. Trump has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536 with respect to Somalia is to continue beyond April 12, 2018. The United States is strongly committed to Somalia's stabilization and believes it is important to maintain sanctions against individuals who undermine its stability. The situation in Somalia poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, hence the decision to continue the national emergency.
