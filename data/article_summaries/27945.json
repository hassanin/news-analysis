On October 2, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation in response to the tragic shooting in Las Vegas. The proclamation expresses condolences for the victims and their families and orders that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff as a mark of respect. The flag will be lowered at the White House, public buildings and grounds, military posts and naval stations, and naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset on October 6, 2017. The proclamation also directs that the flag be flown at half-staff for the same duration at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
