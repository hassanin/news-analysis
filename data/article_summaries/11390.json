The US offers condolences to the families of those killed and expresses commitment to assisting the Iraqi people in confronting the threat posed by ISIL. The recent actions of ISIL in Mosul and surrounding areas demonstrate their desire for death and destruction. The US will support Iraqi leaders in their efforts to achieve national unity in fighting against ISIL. The US will work with Congress to establish the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund to provide resources for Iraq to respond to emerging needs in countering ISIL. Additionally, the US will continue to provide assistance to the Government of Iraq to build their capacity to effectively combat ISIL's efforts to wreak havoc in Iraq and the region.
