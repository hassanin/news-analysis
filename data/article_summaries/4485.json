The Biden-Harris Administration has unveiled the National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy (NCWES), a comprehensive approach to address both immediate and long-term cyber workforce needs. The strategy aims to fill hundreds of thousands of cyber job vacancies across the nation and prepare the country to lead in the digital economy. It focuses on empowering Americans to pursue careers in cybersecurity, with an emphasis on providing access to good-paying jobs for underrepresented communities. The NCWES outlines four pillars: equipping every American with foundational cyber skills, transforming cyber education, expanding and enhancing the national cyber workforce, and strengthening the federal cyber workforce. The strategy has received commitments from various stakeholders, including government agencies, educational institutions, and private industry, to support its objectives through initiatives such as scholarships, training programs, and outreach efforts. The implementation of the strategy is already underway.
