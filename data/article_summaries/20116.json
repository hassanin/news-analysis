President Obama has declared a major disaster in North Dakota due to flooding that occurred between April 22 and May 16, 2013. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures in various counties and the Spirit Lake Reservation. Gary R. Stanley has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
