Second Lady Karen Pence hosted military children and their parents at the Vice President's Residence to celebrate National Pollinator Week. The children participated in educational and interactive activities, including a reading of the book "Hooray for Beekeeping!" by Bobbie Kalman. Mrs. Pence led a tour of the pollinator garden and bee hives, and demonstrated honey extraction. The families also planted their own pollinator garden to take home. Mrs. Pence emphasized the important role of bees and other pollinators in food production, with over 100 U.S. grown crops relying on them. The Vice President's Residence has two hives with an estimated 80,000 bees. Honey bees alone contribute to over $15 billion in added crop value, and the total value of U.S. honey bee products and services sold is approximately $700 million.
