President Donald J. Trump has authorized an increase in federal funding for Public Assistance projects for the Santa Clara Pueblo. The increase is in response to flooding that occurred between June 22 and July 12, 2012. Under former President Obama's declaration, federal funding was available at 75% of total eligible costs. President Trump's order raises the federal share to 90% of total eligible costs. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
