The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus has outlined their priorities, which involve implementing drastic cuts that would negatively impact seniors and increase costs for working and middle-class families. Their aim is to protect and expand tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations. However, these tax cuts would be so costly that the resulting cuts would not reduce the deficit. This stands in contrast to the President's Budget, which focuses on investing in America, reducing costs for families, safeguarding Medicare and Social Security, and decreasing the deficit by $3 trillion over 10 years. The President's Budget ensures that individuals earning less than $400,000 per year will not face any additional taxes. The extreme MAGA House Republicans' proposal is expected to have several negative consequences, including endangering public safety, raising costs for families, outsourcing manufacturing jobs and undermining American workers, weakening national security, and harming seniors. The Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that the budget plans put forth by Congressional Republicans do not add up. In order to meet their goal of balancing the budget in 10 years without raising taxes or making cuts to Social Security, Medicare, defense, and certain veterans' benefits, Congressional Republicans would need to eliminate everything else in the federal budget. The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus proposal is expected to have a significant impact on families, particularly seniors. However, the President has stated that he will prevent any attempts to cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid, and his Budget aims to protect these essential programs while investing in the well-being of seniors.
