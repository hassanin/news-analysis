Jennifer Klein and Aviva Aron-Dine from the Biden-Harris administration met with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and other state officials to celebrate Minnesota becoming the twelfth state, along with the District of Columbia, to pass paid family and medical leave legislation. This legislation will strengthen the state's economy and ensure that workers can take time off without losing a paycheck. The Biden-Harris administration supports a national paid family and medical leave program and applauds states that have made progress in this area. The meeting also discussed the significance of states passing similar measures and the administration's commitment to providing access to paid leave for all working families. The White House officials also congratulated Minnesota on its historic legislative session in 2023, which included gains in climate and clean energy, infrastructure, healthcare, paid sick leave, and free school meals.
