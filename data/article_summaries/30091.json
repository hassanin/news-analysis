President Trump is urging Congress to pass the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate's Law to address sanctuary cities and enhance penalties for those who repeatedly enter the country illegally. He met with immigration crime victims to advocate for the swift passage of these laws. Trump has already made an impact on immigration, with 64% fewer apprehensions and inadmissible entries at the Southwest border compared to last year. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also seen a 40% increase in Enforcement and Removal Operations. Trump has directed the hiring of additional ICE agents and Border Patrol agents to strengthen border security. He is committed to bringing law and order back to the broken immigration system.
