In this statement, the President strongly condemns the Syrian government's brutal assault on the people of Homs, where hundreds of citizens, including women and children, were murdered. He calls on Bashar al-Assad to halt his campaign of killing and crimes against his own people and step aside to allow for a democratic transition. The President emphasizes the responsibility of every government to protect its citizens and states that any government that brutalizes and massacres its people does not deserve to govern. He asserts that the Syrian regime's policy of maintaining power through terrorizing its people indicates its weakness and inevitable collapse. The President calls on the international community to protect the Syrian people from this brutality and urges the UN Security Council to take action to support a political solution to the crisis in Syria. He expresses support for the Syrian people in achieving their aspirations for a brighter future without Assad, where all Syrians are subject to the rule of law and minorities can exercise their rights and uphold their identities. The United States and its international partners are committed to assisting the Syrian people in achieving these goals and stand for universal rights and just political and economic reform. The President concludes by affirming that the suffering citizens of Syria are not alone and that the Assad regime must come to an end.
