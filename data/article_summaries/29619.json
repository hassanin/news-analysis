Vice President Mike Pence left the Colts game on October 8, 2017, because he and President Trump refuse to attend any event that disrespects soldiers, the flag, or the national anthem. He believes that at a time when many Americans are showing courage and resilience, it is important to rally around the flag and what brings us together. Pence supports President Trump's call for NFL players to respect the flag and the national anthem. He stands with the President, soldiers, and will always stand for the flag and national anthem.
