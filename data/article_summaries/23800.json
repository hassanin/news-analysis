President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring December 17, 2016, as Wright Brothers Day. This day commemorates the first successful flight of a powered aircraft by Orville and Wilbur Wright on December 17, 1903. The Wright brothers, who were self-taught mechanics, spent years conducting research and experimentation before achieving their historic flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Their determination and innovation have had a lasting impact on the world. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of encouraging young Americans, regardless of race, gender, or circumstances, to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers. It also highlights the American spirit of innovation and the potential for groundbreaking feats when people refuse to accept limits. The Congress designated December 17 as Wright Brothers Day in 1963 and authorized the President to issue an annual proclamation for its observance.
