Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton addressed the press corps aboard Air Force One en route to Cape Cod Coast Guard Station. He relayed a message from the President, asking the press to relax and enjoy their time in Martha's Vineyard without making news. Burton also requested that the privacy of the First Family, especially the girls, be respected during their vacation. He mentioned that the President would receive daily briefings from a member of the national security staff, as well as paper briefings and secure teleconferences with advisers. Burton provided no additional information on Afghanistan, stating that Admiral Mullen and Ambassador Eikenberry had already covered the topic. He confirmed that the Nesbitts would not be joining the President on the trip, but Maya and her family were on board. Burton was unsure if Mrs. Robinson would be present. There were no plans to see Senator Kennedy or give him a call. The President's relaxation plans included golf, swimming, and spending time with family. Burton dismissed rumors of the President having a plan for the Middle East at the UNGA, stating that such rumors were premature. He mentioned that he would spend his time checking out restaurants with his wife and would be available for briefings in the mornings. The President intended to enjoy Martha's Vineyard without any scheduled plans, but he may go out for dinner or meet with friends if the opportunity arises.
