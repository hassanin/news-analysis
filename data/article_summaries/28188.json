The Anderson Memorial Bridge, located between Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, took 11 months to build in 1912. However, when it came time to repair the bridge almost 100 years later, the project took close to 5 years to complete and went significantly over budget. The reason for this delay was not due to engineering or technical challenges, but rather a complicated regulatory process involving multiple agencies and commissions. President Donald Trump has expressed frustration with the slow permitting and approval process for infrastructure projects and has called for streamlining this process to no more than two years. The Trump Administration has already rolled back regulations and approved major pipeline projects, and now aims to make a sustained investment in America's infrastructure.
