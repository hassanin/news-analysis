The Vice President, Joe Biden, commended the reopening of Republic Windows and Doors, a Chicago window manufacturing plant, thanks to funding from the Recovery Act. The plant had been closed, resulting in the lay-off of 250 union workers. Serious Materials, a California-based company that makes energy efficient windows, purchased Republic and plans to rehire all the laid-off workers. The purchase was motivated by the increased demand for energy efficient products due to the Recovery Act. The Vice President highlighted this as an example of how the Recovery Act is creating jobs and benefiting the country's economic future. Senator Dick Durbin also emphasized the importance of preserving these types of jobs to stimulate the economy. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Energy announced a partnership to streamline federal weatherization efforts and allocate $16 billion to retrofit existing homes, creating jobs and reducing energy costs.
