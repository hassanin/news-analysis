In July, there were historic protests in Cuba where the people demanded freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The Cuban regime responded with harsh prison sentences, arrests, intimidation, and acts of repudiation to silence the protestors. The regime violated civil and political rights, including the right to peaceful assembly, freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom from arbitrary arrest. The United States supports the Cuban people's pursuit of democratic change and urges the regime to stop violence against peaceful protestors, release those unjustly detained, and seek ways to address the needs and ambitions of all Cubans. The US will continue to support the Cuban people's quest for freedom and prosperity.
