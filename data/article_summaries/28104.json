In this article, Vice President Mike Pence announces that he cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to confirm Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. He states that DeVos is a strong advocate for educational opportunity and excellence, and that she has dedicated her time and resources to ensure that every child in America has access to a good education. Pence and President Donald Trump believe that a child's future should not be determined by their zip code, and that every student should have the opportunity to attend a good school, regardless of whether it is public, private, parochial, charter, or any other type of school. Pence thanks Senate Majority Leader McConnell and the Republican Senators who supported DeVos's confirmation, and emphasizes the administration's commitment to improving education for America's children.
