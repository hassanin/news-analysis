The fifth Quad Leaders' Summit took place in Hiroshima on May 20, 2023, with President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India in attendance. The Quad, a partnership focused on the Indo-Pacific region, is committed to promoting development, stability, and prosperity in the area. The leaders discussed various initiatives in infrastructure, investment, critical and emerging technology, maritime security, education, climate and clean energy, health, technology standards, cyber, and space.

In terms of infrastructure, the leaders launched three major initiatives aimed at improving ongoing and future projects. These initiatives include the Quad Infrastructure Fellowship, the Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience, and the Quad Investors Network (QUIN) and Export Credit Agencies MOCC.

The Quad leaders are also focused on critical and emerging technology, aiming to ensure that the region leads in technological innovation and that the benefits are shared. Initiatives in this area include the Commercial Open RAN Deployment in Palau, the Open RAN Security Report, the Advancing Innovation to Empower Nextgen Agriculture (AI-ENGAGE), and the Quad Technology Business and Investment Forum.

Maritime security is another important aspect for the Quad, as the Indo-Pacific region heavily relies on the free movement of goods and people. The Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) was established to enhance maritime domain awareness.

Education is a key focus for the Quad, as the partnership aims to foster future STEM innovators. The Quad STEM Fellowship program was launched to support this objective.

Climate change and clean energy are pressing concerns for the Quad, given that the Indo-Pacific region is heavily impacted by the climate crisis. Initiatives in this area include the Clean Energy Supply Chain Principles and Diversification Program, the Climate Information Services Initiative (CIS), and the Quad Indo-Pacific Oceans Research Alliance (QIPORA).

Health security is also a priority for the Quad, particularly in light of the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Quad Health Security Partnership aims to strengthen health security and preparedness in the region.

The Quad leaders are committed to establishing shared principles and standards in the field of technology. This includes the adoption of Joint Principles on Critical and Emerging Technology Standards and the establishment of the Quad International Standards Cooperation Network (Q-ISCN).

In terms of cybersecurity and space, the Quad is focused on advancing a secure and resilient cyber ecosystem and increasing cooperation in civil and commercial activities in space. Initiatives in these areas include the Cyber Challenge, Critical Infrastructure Principles, Software Security Principles, Extreme Precipitation Events, Commercial Space Cooperation, and Space Situational Awareness.

Overall, the Quad Leaders' Summit in Hiroshima addressed various important issues in the Indo-Pacific region and highlighted the commitment of the Quad to promoting development, stability, and prosperity in the area.
