President Obama and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood are visiting the Fairfax County Parkway Extension project, which is the largest Recovery Act project in Virginia. They will be accompanied by Gregory Andricos, the project manager, and construction workers involved in building the roads, interchanges, and bridges. The President will deliver remarks on the economic benefits of the Recovery Act after the visit. The Fairfax County Parkway project is a four-phased project, with phases 1, 2, and 4 already awarded and underway. There have been 8,000 approved road and bridge projects like this one across the country, creating good-paying jobs for tens of thousands of people. In Virginia, $3.99 billion has been obligated under the Recovery Act, with $1.3 billion already spent. This includes 65 highway projects with $295.4 million obligated.
