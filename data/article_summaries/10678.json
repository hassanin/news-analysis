The President has signed the instrument of ratification for the Hague Convention on International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance. This convention establishes uniform and efficient procedures for processing international child support cases. It will ensure that more children in the United States receive the financial support they need from their parents, regardless of whether their parents reside in the United States or in a foreign country that is party to the convention.
