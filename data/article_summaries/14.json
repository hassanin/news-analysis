On National Agriculture Day, President Joe Biden recognizes the contributions of American farmers, farmworkers, ranchers, fishers, foresters, and other agricultural workers. These individuals play a crucial role in providing food, fuel, and fiber to sustain America and the world. They also serve as stewards of the land, ensuring the safety of animals, plants, and people, and strengthening rural communities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, agricultural workers have adapted their operations to ensure food security for every family. The government is providing economic recovery assistance to support agricultural businesses and build a more competitive and equitable food system. Additionally, the administration is taking steps to protect farmers, including small family farms, by promoting competition, enforcing antitrust laws, and strengthening the supply chain. National Agriculture Day also highlights the adoption of agricultural practices that combat the climate crisis. The government is committed to helping the agriculture sector enhance its resiliency and sustainability while increasing productivity and profitability. President Biden proclaims March 22, 2022, as National Agriculture Day and calls upon all Americans to recognize and appreciate the contributions of the agricultural sector.
