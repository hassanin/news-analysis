This article discusses the creation of an independent claims facility to handle damage claims by individuals and businesses affected by the oil spill. Kenneth Feinberg, who previously administered the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, will serve as the independent claims administrator. The facility will develop standards for recoverable claims and a panel of three judges will be available to hear appeals. The facility is specifically for claims from individuals and businesses, while government claims will continue to be handled directly by BP. The facility aims to decide claims as quickly as possible within the existing statutory timeframe. Claimants maintain their rights under law, including the right to go to court or to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. BP has agreed to contribute $20 billion over four years, with $5 billion per year, and has set aside $20 billion in U.S. assets to assure these commitments. The creation of the escrow account provides assurance that funds will be available to compensate those affected. The account will be used to pay claims, judgments and settlements, natural resource damage costs, and state and local response costs. BP will also contribute $100 million to support unemployed oil rig workers, and has committed $500 million for a ten-year Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative to improve understanding of the impacts of oil and gas pollution. BP will work with governors, state, and local environmental and health authorities to design a long-term monitoring program for the Gulf Region.
