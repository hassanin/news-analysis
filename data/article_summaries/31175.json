The Supreme Court's recent decision on immigration regulations is being hailed as a victory for American taxpayers, workers, and the Constitution. The ruling allows the government to implement regulations that require newcomers to be financially self-sufficient and not rely on public assistance. Two appeals courts had previously ruled in favor of the government's ability to enforce these regulations, but a single district judge's nationwide injunction had prevented their implementation. The decision raises concerns about the power of district judges to issue nationwide injunctions.
