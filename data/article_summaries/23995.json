The article discusses the comprehensive strategy and new tools that the Obama Administration has implemented to prevent and respond to mass atrocities and genocide. The administration has made the prevention of atrocities a key focus of its foreign policy and has taken various actions to protect civilians and hold perpetrators accountable. These actions include leading international efforts to pressure abusive regimes, securing UN resolutions for the protection of civilians, and supporting regional efforts to counter violent groups. 

To strengthen the US government's ability to prevent and respond to atrocities, President Obama created the Atrocities Prevention Board (APB) and issued a directive to assess and recommend reforms to anti-atrocity capabilities. The APB, composed of representatives from various government departments, will oversee the development and implementation of atrocity prevention and response policies. The intelligence community will collect and analyze information on atrocity threats, and the US government will engage with other countries and organizations to expand international commitment and capacity to prevent and respond to atrocities. 

The Obama Administration has also developed new tools to address atrocities, such as targeted sanctions against those who commit or facilitate human rights abuses and a visa ban on human rights abusers. The government will deploy a civilian surge in crisis situations and establish awards for innovation in atrocity prevention. The military and civilian workforce will receive training in atrocity prevention and response, and efforts will be made to hold perpetrators accountable and support prosecutions of atrocities. Additionally, procedures will be put in place to ensure that key decision-makers receive early warning and hear dissenting views on potential or ongoing atrocities.
