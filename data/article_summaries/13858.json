President Obama has announced the first-ever federal effort to attract job-creating foreign investment to the United States through the expansion and enhancement of SelectUSA. The U.S. is already a top destination for foreign direct investment, but this coordinated federal effort aims to further increase competitiveness and attract more investment. The initiative will involve the creation of global teams led by ambassadors to actively encourage and track job-creating investment into the U.S. It will also include a coordinated advocacy process involving senior government officials, including the President, to recruit businesses to bring jobs to the U.S. SelectUSA will provide a single point of contact for investors looking to bring jobs and production to the U.S. and will support states and localities in attracting investment. The expansion and enhancement of SelectUSA will involve providing new services to domestic partners, developing country-specific strategies for investment promotion, and enlisting top administration officials to advocate for high-priority investments into the U.S.
