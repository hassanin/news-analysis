The Trump Administration has decided to end discussions with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) regarding the proposed Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule. Despite efforts to find a solution, CARB has not presented a productive alternative. The Administration plans to finalize a rule later this year to promote safer, cleaner, and more affordable vehicles.
