In this statement, President Obama expresses his concerns about an amendment that the Senate will soon consider regarding Wall Street reform. He argues that this amendment would weaken consumer protections by creating a special loophole for auto dealer-lenders. He claims that this exemption would allow these lenders to increase rates, add hidden fees, and include expensive add-ons without the knowledge of the purchasers. The President believes that this amendment would undermine the provisions that empower consumers with clear information to make informed financial decisions. He also dismisses claims that this legislation unfairly targets auto dealers, stating that these lenders should be held to the same standards as any other bank. The President urges the Senate to reject this amendment and continue to protect American consumers from deceptive practices.
