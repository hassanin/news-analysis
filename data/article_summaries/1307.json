Finland has officially become NATO's 31st ally, marking the fastest ratification process in NATO's modern history. Finland, along with Sweden, applied for NATO membership in May 2022, and their strong democracies and capable militaries align with NATO's values and vision. The addition of Finland strengthens NATO's unity in the face of aggression, particularly from Russian President Putin's war against Ukraine. NATO remains committed to preserving transatlantic security, defending its territory, and facing any challenges that arise. The hope is to also welcome Sweden as a NATO member soon, while urging Turkiye and Hungary to expedite their ratification processes.
