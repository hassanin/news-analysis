Vice President Biden announced that the U.S. Mint will halt the production of Presidential dollar coins for circulation. There are currently 1.4 billion surplus dollar coins sitting in Federal Reserve vaults due to lack of demand. This move will save taxpayers at least $50 million per year in production and storage costs. Additionally, the Department of Justice recovered a record $5.6 billion in fraud government-wide in 2011, a 167 percent increase from 2008. The Department of Health and Human Services is taking new steps to prevent Medicare fraud by telling prescription drug plans to withhold payment when they see signs of suspicious activity related to certain narcotics and painkillers. Overall, these actions demonstrate the administration's commitment to cutting waste and protecting taxpayers.
