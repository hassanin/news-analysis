President Biden has declared a major disaster in the State of Nevada due to severe winter storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred from March 8 to March 19, 2023. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, as well as the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in several counties. Additionally, federal funding will be provided for statewide hazard mitigation measures. FEMA's Mr. Maona M. Ngwira has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
