In a video teleconference from Mar-a-Lago Club and Resort in Palm Beach, Florida, President Trump wished everyone a Merry Christmas and expressed gratitude for the military families. He welcomed deployed units from each branch of the armed forces and commended their efforts in various missions, including supporting Operation Spartan Shield and Inherent Resolve, providing close-air support to the campaign against ISIS, defending high-value assets in the Straits of Hormuz, engaging ISIS and Taliban targets in multiple countries, and providing expeditionary anti-terrorism and force protection. The President also praised the United States Coast Guard for their work in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, and congratulated them for saving thousands of lives. He thanked all the military personnel for their service and asked God to watch over them and their families. The discussion then shifted to personal questions between the President and the media.
