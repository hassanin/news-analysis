President Obama met with members of the Senate Democratic caucus to discuss budget challenges facing the nation. He thanked them for their efforts, highlighting that the Senate passed a budget earlier this year, but House Republicans blocked the regular order budget process. The Senate passed a clean continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown, which would pass the House with bipartisan support if put up for a vote. The Senate is also preparing a bill to remove the threat of default and raise the debt limit for a year. The President and Congressional Democrats are united in not allowing a faction of House Republicans to hold the economy hostage to an extreme political agenda. They will continue to pursue reasonable discussions about the budget after these crises end, with a focus on policies that promote economic growth, job creation, and strengthening the middle class.
