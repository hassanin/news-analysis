In this article, senior administration officials discuss President Obama's decision on the Section 215 Bulk Metadata Program. The President has decided that the government will no longer collect or hold this data in bulk, but instead the data will remain at telephone companies. The officials outline the two-step transition ordered by the President, which includes changes to the existing program and the development of a new program that meets national security requirements without the government holding the data. They also discuss the key attributes of the new program, such as obtaining records only with a judge's approval and limiting the data to two hops from the selection term. The officials mention that they have been in consultation with congressional leadership and other stakeholders, and they hope to work with Congress to pass legislation that achieves the President's goals. They also state that the current authorization for the program will be sought for a 90-day reauthorization while legislation is being developed.
