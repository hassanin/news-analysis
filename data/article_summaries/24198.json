On May 20, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, also known as S. 386. This act provides federal investigators and prosecutors with new tools to combat financial fraud, including mortgage fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and related offenses. The goal is to hold accountable those who have committed financial fraud and protect taxpayer money that has been used for economic stimulus and rescue packages. The act also requires all departments and agencies of the United States to provide information to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission for any relevant inquiries. The executive branch will interpret this requirement in a way that does not violate any constitutional privileges.
