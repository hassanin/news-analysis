President Obama has decided to increase U.S. humanitarian assistance to Yemen by $29.6 million, bringing the total to $42.5 million for this fiscal year. The assistance will provide food, water, shelter, and healthcare to over 280,000 individuals affected by the conflict in northern Yemen and refugees in southern Yemen. The United States is urging other donors to support international agencies in meeting these urgent humanitarian needs. They also call on all parties to ensure the safety of civilians and aid workers, as well as the safe passage of relief supplies. The United States is troubled by reports of fresh fighting in Sa'ada and urges compliance with the ceasefire agreement announced in February. They also emphasize the need for a comprehensive and inclusive national dialogue between all opposition groups and the ruling party to address grievances and increase stability. In order to achieve a unified, stable, democratic, and prosperous Yemen, political and economic reforms must be implemented to enhance the confidence of the Yemeni people in their government. The United States continues to work with international partners to support Yemen's political, economic, and social reforms.
