First Lady Michelle Obama and U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack have announced proposed guidelines for local school wellness policies. These guidelines aim to ensure that foods and beverages marketed to children in schools are consistent with healthy standards. The goal is to promote healthy choices and eliminate marketing of unhealthy products in schools. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has also launched a website with resources to help schools implement these policies. Additionally, a program that provides free healthy meals to low-income students will be expanded to over 22,000 schools nationwide, starting from July 1, 2014. This initiative aims to help as many as 9 million American children eat healthy meals at school, with a focus on improving educational achievement.
