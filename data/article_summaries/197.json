President Biden has declared a major disaster in the State of Oklahoma due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from May 2 to May 8, 2022. This declaration allows for Federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. Affected individuals in seven counties, including Adair, Cherokee, Muskogee, Okmulgee, Pottawatomie, Seminole, and Tulsa, can receive grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in their recovery. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Roland W. Jackson has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made if necessary. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will be available from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. seven days a week until further notice. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
