The White House has announced the appointment of the 2016-2017 class of White House Fellows. The Fellows come from diverse backgrounds and professions, and have shown a strong commitment to public service and leadership. The program was created in 1964 to give promising American leaders first-hand experience with the workings of the Federal government and to encourage active citizenship and lifelong commitment to service. The Fellows take part in an education program to broaden their knowledge of leadership, policy formulation, and current affairs, and also participate in community service projects. Selection as a White House Fellow is highly competitive and based on professional achievement, leadership potential, and commitment to public service. Throughout its history, the program has fostered leaders in government, business, law, media, medicine, education, diplomacy, and the military.
