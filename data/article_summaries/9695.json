President Obama has directed that a series of steps be taken to support the Cuban people's desire to enjoy basic human rights and to freely determine their country's future. The President has directed the Secretaries of State, Treasury and Commerce to lift all restrictions on the ability of individuals to visit family members in Cuba and to send them remittances. Steps will also be taken to enable the freer flow of information among the Cuban people and between those in Cuba and the rest of the world, as well as to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian items directly to the Cuban people. The President believes that these measures will help fulfill the goal of a Cuba that respects the basic human, political, and economic rights of all its citizens.
