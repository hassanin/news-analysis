The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a briefing by OMB Director Peter Orszag and Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Christina Romer. They discussed the fiscal year 2011 budget, which focuses on job creation, middle class security, and fiscal sustainability. They highlighted the importance of investments in job creation, education, innovation, and clean energy. They also discussed the need to address the medium-term and long-term fiscal deficits, and the creation of a bipartisan fiscal commission to develop plans for deficit reduction. They emphasized the importance of a balanced approach to deficit reduction that does not harm the economic recovery. The budget includes a three-year freeze on non-security discretionary spending, reductions in the deficit through measures such as a financial services fee and allowing the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for high-income earners, and investments in research and development and clean energy. They also discussed the economic assumptions underlying the budget, including projections for GDP growth, unemployment rate, and inflation rate. They noted that the budget includes funding for war efforts, but subject to scrutiny and constraint. They also discussed efforts to improve performance management within the federal government, including in areas such as information technology, acquisition, and personnel hiring.
