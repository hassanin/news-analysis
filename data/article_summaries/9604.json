This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama declaring September 22 through September 28, 2013, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. The proclamation highlights the important role that Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have played in the United States. It mentions that before the Civil War, education, especially college education, was inaccessible for most African Americans. However, after the war and the signing of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, HBCUs began to emerge. The proclamation recognizes the contributions of HBCUs in building the middle class and producing notable thinkers, entrepreneurs, doctors, scientists, judges, lawyers, service members, and educators. It also emphasizes the role of HBCUs in fostering an understanding of history and self. The proclamation states that HBCUs continue to provide pathways of opportunity for students across the country and that ensuring they have the necessary resources to support students is a priority for the administration. The proclamation calls for observing National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week with appropriate programs and activities to acknowledge the contributions of these institutions and their alumni.
