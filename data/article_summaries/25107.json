The press briefing highlighted the progress made in addressing the opioid crisis in the United States. Life expectancy has increased for the first time in four years, and drug overdose deaths have decreased for the first time in 29 years. The decrease in overdose deaths is attributed to a whole-of-government approach, led by President Trump and the entire administration. The briefing discussed the impact of opioids, particularly fentanyl, on the crisis. Efforts have been made to increase awareness, provide treatment and recovery options, improve law enforcement interdiction, and reduce the availability of opioids. The briefing also mentioned the SUPPORT Act, which has led to increased funding and awareness for the opioid crisis. Other initiatives, such as the STOP Act and the FindTreatment.gov tool, were highlighted as well. The briefing acknowledged that there is still more work to be done, but the progress made so far is significant.
