On June 6, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed the VA Mission Act of 2018, a law that aims to transform the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) into a high-performing and integrated healthcare system. The law prioritizes patient choice by allowing veterans to seek medical treatment from private doctors if the VA cannot meet their needs in a timely manner. The VA Mission Act has five main objectives, including improving veterans' access to healthcare and expanding caregiver support. The law comes at a crucial time, as funding for the current Choice program was expected to be exhausted soon. While this law represents a milestone in veterans care, the Trump Administration remains committed to further transforming and modernizing the VA, as well as implementing broader healthcare reforms for all Americans.
