President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed July 19 through July 25, 2020, as Captive Nations Week. This proclamation, first established by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959, shows the United States' support for people worldwide who are denied fundamental rights by their governments. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of individual liberty, the rule of law, and consent-based governments. It also criticizes authoritarian regimes that use the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to restrict human rights and suppress freedom. The proclamation specifically mentions China's government and its handling of the pandemic, as well as its actions in Hong Kong. The proclamation calls on all nations to respect individual liberty and be accountable to their people. It concludes by urging Americans to reaffirm their commitment to supporting those striving for liberty, justice, and the rule of law around the world.
