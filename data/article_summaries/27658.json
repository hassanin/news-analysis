President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order that will provide historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) with increased support. The executive order is expected to strengthen the office that encourages the federal government to do business with HBCUs by moving it to the White House. Trump's move to support HBCUs is seen as an attempt to outdo his predecessors, including former President Barack Obama. Many education experts credit Republican leaders for helping to improve HBCUs, while some black college administrators were disappointed with Obama's lack of priority for these institutions. Trump's commitment to HBCUs is seen as an effort to address their neglect over the past eight years. The executive order will coincide with a visit by 90 presidents of HBCUs to Washington for a conference, which will be attended by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senators Marco Rubio and Tim Scott.
