President Trump signed the INTERDICT Act, a law that directs the Department of Homeland Security to provide additional tools and resources to detect and intercept the supply of illicit fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that has caused thousands of deaths in the United States. The law aims to combat the influx of deadly drugs from countries such as China and Mexico. The signing of the law was attended by members of Congress from both parties, who expressed their support for the measures to stop the opioid epidemic.
