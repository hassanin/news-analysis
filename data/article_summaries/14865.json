President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Minnesota and authorized federal aid to help with recovery efforts following severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between June 20-26, 2013. The federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Benton, Big Stone, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Freeborn, Grant, Hennepin, Houston, McLeod, Morrison, Pope, Sibley, Stearns, Stevens, Swift, Traverse, and Wilkin. Additionally, federal funding will be provided for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Kari Suzann Cowie has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, with the possibility of additional designations being made in the future based on further damage assessments.
