President Barack Obama is set to announce a comprehensive infrastructure plan at the Milwaukee Area Labor Council Laborfest. The plan aims to expand and renew the nation's roads, railways, and runways. The event is open to the public, but the speaking program requires tickets, with priority given to union members and their families. Several pre-program speakers and elected officials are expected to attend, including Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, AFL-CIO President Rich Trumka, and Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis. Senator Russ Feingold will be present at the Laborfest parade in the morning but will be in Janesville for his hometown parade, which he attends annually.
