On May 9, 2014, the President signed into law the "Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014" or the "DATA Act" (S. 994). This act amends the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to make certain classes of Federal agency spending data available to the public in a more detailed and specific manner than before. It also requires agencies to report this data on USASpending.gov, creates Government-wide standards for financial data, applies accounting approaches developed by the Recovery Act's Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to all agencies, and streamlines agency reporting requirements.
