The Council of Economic Advisers has released a report to Congress highlighting the Trump Administration's economic achievements and policy actions. The report shows that the U.S. economy has outperformed expectations, with strong growth in GDP, employment, labor productivity, and capital expenditures. The report credits the Trump Administration's tax cuts and deregulation efforts for stimulating business investment and economic growth. It also discusses the administration's initiatives to expand labor force opportunities, reduce regulatory costs, increase healthcare choice and competition, promote American energy independence, ensure a balanced financial regulatory landscape, adapt to technological change, and reduce poverty and improve self-sufficiency. The report concludes that a unified agenda of market-based reforms is the most effective approach to achieving maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.
