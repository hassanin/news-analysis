In this proclamation issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 31, 2020, he recognizes National Donate Life Month and honors individuals who have registered as organ, eye, and tissue donors. The President acknowledges the impact of these selfless donors and the medical community in improving the quality of life for many Americans through organ transplants. He highlights that approximately 60 percent of American adults have registered as donors and that in 2019, almost 40,000 patients received transplants, resulting in the most lives saved through organ donations in a single year. However, there is still a vital need for more organ donors, as over 110,000 people in the United States are currently awaiting organ transplants. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of blood stem cell donors for individuals with certain illnesses, as well as the need to increase access to kidney transplants. President Trump encourages all willing and able Americans to sign up as organ or tissue donors to improve and save lives.
