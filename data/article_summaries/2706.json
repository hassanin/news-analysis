Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger provided an update on cyber threats during a press briefing. She stated that the U.S. has warned about the potential for Russia to conduct cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in the United States. While there is no certainty of a cyber incident, Neuberger emphasized the importance of immediate action and responsibility from private sector partners to protect critical services. The administration has been working to prepare for this threat, providing warnings and advice to the private sector and mandating cybersecurity measures where possible. The government has also published advisories and used existing authorities to mandate new cybersecurity measures. Neuberger thanked Congress for its partnership in this effort and welcomed additional work to address cybersecurity gaps. The President has stated that the U.S. is not seeking confrontation with Russia but will be prepared to respond if disruptive cyberattacks occur.
