President Biden has declared a major disaster in the State of Alaska and authorized federal assistance for recovery efforts following a severe winter storm and straight-line winds that occurred from December 25 to December 27, 2021. The declaration allows for federal funding to supplement state, tribal, and local government recovery efforts, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations. The funding will be available for emergency work, facility repairs or replacements, and hazard mitigation measures. Thomas J. Dargan has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
