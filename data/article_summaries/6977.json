President Joe Biden has issued an executive order to establish the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders and the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. The order aims to address systemic barriers to equity, justice, and opportunity faced by these communities and to combat anti-Asian violence and discrimination. The Commission will provide advice to the President on various issues, including health, education, and hate crimes, while the Initiative will coordinate federal interagency efforts to eliminate barriers and advance equity for these communities. The order also emphasizes the need to collect and use disaggregated data to better understand the experiences of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and to improve access to government programs and services. The Commission and Initiative will consist of members appointed by the President and representatives from various government agencies. The order supersedes previous executive orders related to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
