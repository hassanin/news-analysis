The article is a speech given by Vice President Kamala Harris at the Grady Cole Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The speech focuses on the fight for reproductive rights and the impact of the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs case, which restricted access to abortion. Harris discusses the consequences of extreme abortion bans, such as the denial of healthcare and the closure of reproductive care clinics. She highlights the hypocrisy of these bans, as they ignore the maternal mortality crisis and lack access to basic women's healthcare. Harris emphasizes the need for Congress to pass legislation to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade and pledges President Joe Biden's support in signing it. She encourages the audience to continue organizing and fighting for reproductive freedom, as well as other fundamental rights and freedoms. The speech concludes with a call to stand for what they believe in and fight for the future of the country.
