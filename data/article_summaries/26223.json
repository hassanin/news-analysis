President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in Georgia due to the conditions caused by Hurricane Irma. This declaration authorizes the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate all disaster relief efforts. The aim is to provide assistance for emergency measures, such as saving lives, protecting property, and ensuring public health and safety. FEMA will identify and provide necessary equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Debris removal and emergency protective measures will be funded at 75% by the federal government. Thomas J. McCool has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
