Vice President Kamala Harris held a meeting with leaders to discuss the impact of the recent Dobbs decision by the United States Supreme Court on Americans with disabilities. The meeting took place on the anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was aimed at ensuring equal treatment and protection for all people in the country. Vice President Harris expressed concerns about how the Dobbs decision, which restricts abortion access, will disproportionately affect individuals with disabilities. She highlighted that people with disabilities face higher rates of pregnancy complications, are more likely to experience poverty and mobility challenges, and are at a higher risk of sexual violence. The Vice President emphasized the need to address the disparities that still exist in accessing resources and prioritizing the rights of people with disabilities. She also called for coalition building to strengthen the movement advocating for reproductive care for all individuals. Vice President Harris acknowledged that there is still work to be done to fulfill the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act and expressed gratitude to the leaders present for their participation in the important conversation.
