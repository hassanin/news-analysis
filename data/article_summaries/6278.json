President Biden addressed a group of new citizens at a naturalization ceremony in the East Room of the White House. He congratulated the 21 individuals from 16 different nationalities and highlighted the courage it takes to leave everything behind and start anew in the United States. The President emphasized that America is built on the idea of possibilities and that immigrants have always played a vital role in shaping the nation. He acknowledged the contributions of immigrants during the pandemic, including frontline workers and scientists. President Biden also called for immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented individuals and protections for Dreamers and TPS recipients. He closed his speech by inviting Sandra Lindsay, a nurse from Jamaica who became the first person in the U.S. to receive the COVID-19 vaccine outside of clinical trials, to the stage and recognizing her contributions.
