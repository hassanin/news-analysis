President Obama has issued a proclamation declaring March 31st as Cesar Chavez Day in honor of the civil rights activist and labor leader. Cesar Chavez fought for the rights and benefits of farm workers, leading boycotts and advocating for nonviolence. His legacy teaches us the importance of social justice and the power of one person to make a difference. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe the day with service, community, and educational programs to honor Chavez's enduring legacy.
