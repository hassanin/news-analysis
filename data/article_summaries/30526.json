President Donald J. Trump has announced an initiative to address the opioid crisis in the United States. The initiative aims to reduce both the demand for opioids and the over-prescription of these drugs. It also plans to crack down on the supply of illicit drugs, both internationally and domestically. Additionally, the initiative seeks to help those struggling with addiction through evidence-based treatment and recovery support services. The goal of the initiative is to build a stronger, healthier, and drug-free society.
