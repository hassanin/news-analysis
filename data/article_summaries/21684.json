This article discusses the Obama Administration's proposal for ending the Section 215 bulk telephony metadata program. The President ordered a transition to establish a new mechanism that would preserve the necessary capabilities without the government holding the bulk metadata. The steps taken to implement this transition include seeking to modify the program to limit government queries to specific numbers approved by a judge and limiting the results to metadata within two hops. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved this modification. The President instructed the Attorney General and the Intelligence Community to develop options for a new program that could replace the Section 215 program. The proposal aims to end the bulk collection of telephony metadata records under Section 215 while ensuring access to necessary information for national security. The new program would involve records remaining with telephone companies, government access to records through individual court orders, and limited time for querying the data. Legislation will be needed to implement the President's proposal, and the Administration is working with Congress on this issue. In the meantime, the President has directed the Department of Justice to seek a 90-day reauthorization of the existing program.
