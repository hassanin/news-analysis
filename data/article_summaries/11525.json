The White House has announced additional sanctions related to Iran. The Obama administration has steadily built the most comprehensive and biting sanctions regime that the Iranian government has ever faced. The purpose of the sanctions is to put pressure on Iran to come in line with their international obligations with respect to their nuclear program. The administration has worked with Congress to develop additional tools for sanctions, and has built an international coalition to amplify the impact of the sanctions. The sanctions are having a significant impact on the Iranian economy, with the country's oil exports and currency value decreasing. The administration has approved a new executive order that imposes new sanctions against the Iranian energy and petrochemical sectors. Additionally, two institutions that have knowingly enabled financial transactions for designated Iranian banks have been sanctioned. The administration believes that the sanctions are working, but Iran has not yet made the decision to come in line with their international obligations. The goal is to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and the administration will continue to use all available tools to achieve that objective. The administration is reviewing a compromise Iran sanctions bill introduced in the House, and is optimistic about working with Congress to develop additional tools for sanctions.
