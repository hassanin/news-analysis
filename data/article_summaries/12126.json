Michigan Governor Rick Snyder responded to President Obama's speech by highlighting the similarities between the president's proposals and actions already taken in Michigan. Snyder mentioned that Michigan has already cut the double tax on small businesses and ended loopholes for corporations by implementing a flat corporate income tax. He encouraged Congress to consider these changes to create a favorable environment for job growth. Snyder also emphasized the importance of balancing the budget, paying down debt, and saving for the future, suggesting that Michigan's approach should serve as an example. He supported the president's call for infrastructure projects, particularly the New International Trade Crossing, which he believes will boost Michigan's economy and allow for increased exports. Snyder acknowledged that Michigan has been hit hard by job losses and urged a focus on productive decision-making to revitalize the state and the country.
