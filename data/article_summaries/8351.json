Queen Elizabeth II, who recently passed away, was more than just a monarch. She was a symbol of stability and pride for generations of Britons. Her reign, spanning seven decades, witnessed significant progress and advancements in human dignity. Queen Elizabeth II was known for her grace, unwavering commitment to duty, and her role in strengthening the alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States. Her legacy will be remembered in British history and around the world. As a mark of respect, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has ordered that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff at various locations, including the White House and all public buildings, until the day of interment. This gesture extends to U.S. embassies and facilities abroad as well.
