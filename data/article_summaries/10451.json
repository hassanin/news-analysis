The White House and the Department of Education have announced the six high schools selected as finalists for the first annual Race to the Top High School Commencement Challenge. The challenge invited public high schools to submit applications showing their dedication to providing students with an excellent education that prepares them for college and career choices. The finalists were selected based on their dedication to academic excellence and their efforts in preparing students for college and career readiness. The six finalists are Blue Valley Northwest High School, Clark Montessori Junior High and High School, Denver School of Science and Technology, Environmental Charter High School, Kalamazoo Central High School, and MAST Academy. The students from each finalist school will work with The Get Schooled Foundation to create a video highlighting how their school fulfills the challenge's criteria. These videos and portions of each school's written application will be featured on the White House website, and the public will have the opportunity to vote for the three schools they think best meet the President's goal. The President will then select a national winner from the three finalists and visit the winning high school to deliver the commencement address.
