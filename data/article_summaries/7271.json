Vice President Kamala Harris addressed a group of leaders, including Senator Padilla, Congressman Jimmy Gomez, Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, and Mayor Eric Garcetti, to discuss the challenges facing the nation. She emphasized the importance of faith, unity, and hope in addressing these challenges. The conversation focused on two main issues: the rise of hate and misinformation, and the impending Supreme Court decision that could impact the right to privacy and access to reproductive healthcare. Harris expressed the need for sensible gun laws to address hate-driven violence and the importance of upholding the principles of Roe v. Wade. She also highlighted the threat to these principles and priorities, citing the recent passage of a law in Louisiana that restricts abortion rights without exceptions for rape or incest. Harris commended the faith leaders for their work in bringing healing and hope to communities and emphasized the need to build a coalition based on shared principles and beliefs.
