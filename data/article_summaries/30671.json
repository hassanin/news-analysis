President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order to establish the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. The Commission, chaired by Governor Chris Christie, will study ways to combat drug abuse, addiction, and the opioid crisis. This crisis caused over 50,000 deaths in 2015 and has caused significant pain and suffering across America. The Commission will work closely with the White House Office of American Innovation led by Jared Kushner. President Trump expressed his commitment to combat this epidemic and help those affected by it. The signing of the Executive Order followed a listening session at the White House, where leaders from various backgrounds discussed solutions to this crisis.
