President Biden announced actions to protect women after the Supreme Court decision that took away a woman's right to choose. He emphasized the need for Congress to restore the protections of Roe as federal law. The administration is taking two actions to protect women: 

1. Protecting the Right to Seek Medical Care: Women should be free to travel to another state to seek the care they need without interference. The administration will fight against any state or local official who tries to hinder this right.

2. Protecting Access to Medication: The President directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure women's access to critical medications for reproductive health care, including contraception and medication abortion. The administration aims to make mifepristone, a drug used to safely end early pregnancies, more widely accessible, even through telehealth and mail.
