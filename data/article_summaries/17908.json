President Obama has declared a major disaster in Minnesota due to severe storms and flooding that occurred from June 14-21, 2012. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures in various counties and Indian Tribes within the state. Mark A. Neveau has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
