The United States has announced that it will contribute $3 million to the United Nations Trust Fund for Global and Regional Disarmament. This contribution is aimed at preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 is an important tool in preventing access to materials and resources needed to acquire or develop dangerous weapons and their means of delivery. The U.S. contribution will support the work of the 1540 Committee, which helps countries around the world in adopting and enforcing laws to prohibit the spread of weapons of mass destruction to non-state actors. This contribution is in line with the President's commitment to assisting countries in meeting their obligations under UNSCR 1540.
