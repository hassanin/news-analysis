The article discusses an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in 2012, establishing the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans. The order aims to improve educational outcomes for African Americans of all ages and ensure they receive a proper education that prepares them for college, careers, and fulfilling lives. It acknowledges the progress made since the Brown v. Board of Education decision, but also highlights the remaining obstacles in the educational system for African Americans, such as lack of access to effective teachers, safe schools, and college-preparatory classes. The order outlines the mission and functions of the Initiative, including increasing understanding of the challenges faced by African American students, improving early childhood education, reducing disproportionate referrals to special education, implementing successful education reform strategies, ensuring access to resources and effective teachers, reducing dropout rates, increasing college access and success, and enhancing family and community engagement in education. The Initiative is supported by an Interagency Working Group and advised by a President's Advisory Commission. The article concludes by stating that the Initiative will be periodically publishing reports on its activities.
