The article discusses an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on November 12, 2020. The order declares a national emergency with respect to the threat posed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) exploiting United States capital to develop its military, intelligence, and security apparatus. The PRC achieves this through its national strategy of Military-Civil Fusion, which compels civilian Chinese companies to support its military activities. These companies raise capital by selling securities to United States investors. The executive order prohibits transactions in publicly traded securities of any Communist Chinese military company by any United States person. It also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to take actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, to carry out the purposes of the order. The order includes definitions of terms such as "Communist Chinese military company," "entity," "person," "security," "securities," "transaction," and "United States person." The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to submit reports to Congress on the national emergency. The order does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies and is subject to applicable law and appropriations. It also does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
