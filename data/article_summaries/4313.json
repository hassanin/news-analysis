The Biden-Harris Administration is taking new actions to protect LGBTQI+ communities during Pride Month. They are addressing the surge in violence against LGBTQI+ individuals and community spaces by launching the LGBTQI+ Community Safety Partnership, which will provide safety resources and build trust between LGBTQI+ organizations and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Justice is also committed to protecting LGBTQI+ rights and will coordinate stakeholder meetings and release a fact sheet summarizing their work. Additionally, the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services will host national convenings to support LGBTQI+ students and promote LGBTQI+ health equity.
