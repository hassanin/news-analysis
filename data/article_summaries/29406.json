The article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued on August 8, 2020, authorizing the Other Needs Assistance Program for Major Disaster Declarations related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The memorandum acknowledges the financial distress caused by the pandemic and the expiration of relief programs created by Congress. It directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide benefits from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and urges states to use their allocated funds to provide temporary enhanced financial support to those affected by COVID-19 unemployment. The memorandum also authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, through FEMA, to provide other needs assistance for lost wages to eligible claimants. The program would provide a $400 payment per week, with a $300 federal contribution, to claimants who meet certain criteria. The memorandum sets conditions for the program and states that it will terminate when the DRF balance reaches $25 billion or by December 6, 2020. It also specifies that the program will end if legislation is enacted to provide supplemental federal unemployment compensation for unemployed or underemployed individuals due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
