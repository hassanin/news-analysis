President Donald Trump has authorized increased disaster assistance for the Seminole Tribe of Florida in response to the damages caused by Hurricane Irma in 2017. The increase in federal funding applies to Public Assistance projects undertaken between September 4 and October 4, 2017. Previously, federal funding for Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance was set at 75% of eligible costs. However, under the President's new order, the federal share for Public Assistance has been increased to 90% of eligible costs, excluding those costs already approved at 100%.
