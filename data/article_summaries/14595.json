The White House has announced a new U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa, which focuses on strengthening democratic institutions and spurring economic growth, trade, and investment. The strategy aims to advance democracy by supporting open and accountable governance, promoting human rights and the rule of law, and challenging leaders who undermine democratic processes. It also seeks to promote economic growth through increased trade and investment in sub-Saharan Africa, improve economic governance, and encourage U.S. companies to trade with and invest in Africa. The strategy emphasizes the importance of deepening security partnerships with African countries and regional organizations, as well as promoting sustainable development outcomes.
