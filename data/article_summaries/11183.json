The Obama Administration has launched the Partnership for Resilience and Preparedness (PREP), a public-private collaboration to support climate resilience efforts. The partnership aims to identify priority-information needs, reduce barriers to data access, and develop an open-source platform for sharing and learning about climate data. PREP emerged out of the Climate Data Initiative (CDI) and will be coordinated by the U.S. Global Change Research Program and World Resources Institute. In addition, the Administration, along with 13 other nations and organizations, has released a Joint Declaration on Harnessing the Data Revolution for Climate Resilience, calling for concrete actions to increase international climate resilience through improved data accessibility and usability. Various federal agencies and non-federal organizations have committed to supporting PREP, including Amazon Web Services, IBM, Google, and the World Bank. A beta platform has been released to enhance data accessibility and visualization for climate resilience.
