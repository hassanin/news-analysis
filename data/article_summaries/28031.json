President Donald Trump has approved the National Strategy for Countering WMD Terrorism, which aims to protect the United States from the threat of terrorism involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). The strategy has three main elements: leading global efforts to prevent terrorists' access to WMD and related materials, applying pressure on terrorist groups seeking to obtain and use these weapons, and strengthening defenses against WMD threats at home and abroad. The goal is to reduce the risk of these weapons falling into the hands of dangerous terrorists and to fulfill the President's commitment to protecting Americans.
