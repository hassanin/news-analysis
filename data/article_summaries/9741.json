President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House requesting consideration for amendments to the FY 2015 Budget. The amendments are for the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of State and Other International Programs (State/OIP) to fund Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The purpose of these amendments is to provide $5.6 billion for OCO activities to degrade and defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). This funding would be in addition to the previously requested amounts for both DOD and State/OIP OCO activities. The request reflects the evolving approach to counter ISIL and includes the necessary additional funding to implement a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy.
