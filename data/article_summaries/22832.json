President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 2014 as National Wilderness Month in the United States. This proclamation reflects on the 50th anniversary of the Wilderness Act and the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act, which set aside federal land for the use and enjoyment of the American people. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of preserving the country's wilderness for future generations and highlights the role of wilderness in supporting research, education, recreation, and tourism. The president also calls for the full and permanent funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund and encourages Americans to visit and learn about the nation's wilderness areas.
