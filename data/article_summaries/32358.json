On November 14, 1994, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency regarding the threat posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and their means of delivery. This declaration was made through Executive Order 12938. Over the years, this declaration has been amended twice, first in 1998 through Executive Order 13094 and then in 2005 through Executive Order 13382. The national emergency is set to continue beyond November 14, 2017, as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems still pose an extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This continuation is in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. The notice regarding the continuation of the national emergency will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
