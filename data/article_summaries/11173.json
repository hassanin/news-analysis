The article is a statement by NSC Spokesperson Bernadette Meehan regarding the illegal separatist elections that took place in Eastern Ukraine. The United States condemns these elections, as they contravened Ukraine's constitution and electoral norms. Russia and its separatist proxies violated the terms of the Minsk Protocol by holding these elections. The United States will not recognize the authority of individuals claiming to represent parts of Donetsk and Luhansk based on this illegal vote. The article also expresses concern over Russia's movement of troops and military equipment near the border, as well as reports of attacks on OSCE Special Monitoring Mission UAVs. Moscow's failure to fulfill its obligations under the Minsk agreements raises doubts about its commitment to a peaceful resolution. The United States calls on Russia to adhere to its commitments, including the withdrawal of foreign forces, restoration of Ukrainian control over the border with OSCE monitoring, and holding local elections in accordance with the special status law. The article emphasizes that Russia has a choice - if it supports the peace process and fulfills its commitments, the costs for its destabilizing actions will lessen, but if it continues to ignore its commitments, the costs will rise.
