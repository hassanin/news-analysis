President Donald Trump has notified Congress that the national emergency declared with respect to the situation in Mali will continue beyond July 26, 2020. The decision was made due to ongoing issues in Mali, including violations of ceasefire arrangements, terrorist activities, drug trafficking, human rights abuses, hostage-taking, and attacks against civilians and security forces. Trump determined that the national emergency declaration is necessary to address these threats to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
