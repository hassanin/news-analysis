Vice President Mike Pence delivered a speech at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) in Washington, D.C., where he discussed the Trump administration's plans for tax cuts. Pence emphasized the need for tax reform to stimulate economic growth and create jobs. He outlined four core principles of the administration's tax plan: giving working families a historic tax cut, restoring simplicity and fairness to the tax code, cutting taxes on American businesses, and cutting taxes on overseas profits of American companies. Pence also highlighted the positive impact that tax cuts could have on wages and productivity. He called on AEI and its supporters to help spread the message about the benefits of tax cuts and urged them to support the tax reform efforts in Congress.
