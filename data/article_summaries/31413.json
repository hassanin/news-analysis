During a press briefing, White House officials discussed the administration's efforts to safeguard the nation's elections and protect against foreign interference. They emphasized that President Trump has made it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference in elections. Efforts are underway to provide cybersecurity assistance to state and local authorities, and actions are being taken to investigate and prosecute those who attempt to interfere illegally in the political and electoral process. The officials also stated that the intelligence community is postured to identify threats against the United States, and they are focused on providing threat assessments to officials at all levels of government. They also addressed concerns about Russian interference in the 2018 elections, stating that while there is a pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to weaken and divide the United States, the efforts are not as robust as they were during the 2016 election. The officials also discussed the administration's approach to countering foreign influence operations and the importance of a public-private partnership in addressing this threat.
