The United Kingdom and United States recently held high-level consultations on the Indo-Pacific region. Both countries expressed their commitment to deepen their alignment and cooperation in the region, including with other allies and partners. They acknowledged the support of Indo-Pacific countries like Japan, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, and Singapore in standing against Russia's attack on Ukraine. The UK and US officials pledged to coordinate the implementation of their respective Indo-Pacific strategies and committed to delivering conventionally-armed nuclear-powered submarines and advanced capabilities to promote security in the region. They also agreed to engage positively in the Indo-Pacific's economic development, support green transitions, collaborate on critical technologies, ensure economic security, and oppose economic coercion. The maintenance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the situation in Hong Kong were also discussed. In the coming months, the US and UK will invest in partnerships with Pacific Islands, support ASEAN, enhance ties with India, and establish a continuing dialogue on the Indo-Pacific.
