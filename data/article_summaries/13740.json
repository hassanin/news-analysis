During a bilateral meeting between President Obama and Prime Minister Kan of Japan, they discussed various topics including the U.S.-Japan alliance, economic and trade issues, the Middle East, and upcoming events such as the APEC meeting and the TPP. They agreed on the importance of Japan's role in promoting economic growth and development and expressed their commitment to continue investing in the Middle East and North Africa for stability and development. They also mentioned the need for Japan to follow through on the realignment road map on Okinawa to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance. Additionally, Prime Minister Kan will pay an official visit to Washington in September for substantive discussions. The meeting did not specifically address nuclear safety standards, as it was being covered in the G8 discussions. The President welcomed Japan's commitment to staying engaged in global and regional affairs while focusing on the recovery and revitalization of Japan's economy.
