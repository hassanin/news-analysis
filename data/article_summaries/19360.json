On May 28, 2009, President Obama identified four individuals and organizations as Significant Foreign Narcotics Traffickers, subject to sanctions under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. The designated individuals include Daniel Rendon Herrera from Colombia, the Haji Juma Khan Organization from Afghanistan, Walid Makled Garcia from Venezuela, and Imam Bheel from Pakistan. The President's action demonstrates his commitment to targeting top drug traffickers and their financial networks. The Kingpin Act, enacted in 1999, aims to deny these traffickers access to the U.S. financial system, prohibit trade and transactions with them, and freeze their assets within U.S. jurisdictions. The Act does not target the countries or governments where these individuals and entities operate. Since the Act's implementation, a total of 82 individuals or entities have been designated for sanctions. The President's letter to relevant Congressional committees provides further details on these designations.
