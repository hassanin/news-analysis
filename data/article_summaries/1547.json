This article is a National Security Memorandum issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. It addresses the issue of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and associated labor abuses, which pose significant threats to ocean health and global overfishing. The memorandum outlines the policy of the administration to combat IUU fishing and forced labor in the seafood supply chain. It directs executive departments and agencies to coordinate efforts, use existing authorities, and collaborate with international partners to address these challenges comprehensively. The memorandum also emphasizes the importance of promoting sustainable fishing practices, increasing global attention to IUU fishing, and leveraging the United States' large seafood import market to incentivize ethical behavior in the industry.
