The Secretary of the Interior has certified that nationals of the People's Republic of China (PRC) are engaging in trade or taking of eight species of pangolin that diminishes the effectiveness of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Pangolins, the world's only scaly mammal, are being captured and trafficked at a higher rate annually than rhinoceroses, elephants, and tigers combined. Despite the prohibition on international trade of pangolins, the PRC remains the largest destination country for pangolin scales. While the PRC has taken some steps to curtail pangolin trafficking, it maintains a system that indirectly provides commercial avenues for selling illegal pangolin specimens through its domestic pangolin market. Pangolin seizures have increased tenfold since 2014, with 71 percent of seizures destined for the PRC. The size of individual seizures has also increased. The PRC must do more to close domestic markets for pangolins and pangolin specimens that provide cover for the illegal market. If significant commitments by the PRC to protect pangolin species have not been made by December 31, 2023, the United States plans to impose trade measures on certain products from the PRC.
