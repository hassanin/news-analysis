On March 6, 2003, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency and blocked the property of certain individuals in Zimbabwe who were deemed to be undermining Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions. This action was taken under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Additional steps were taken in 2005 and 2008 to expand the scope of the national emergency and block the property of more individuals. The President has determined that the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons still pose a threat to the foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2003 will continue for another year.
