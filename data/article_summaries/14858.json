In this statement from February 17, 2009, the President discusses the urgent need to address the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He acknowledges that the Taliban is resurgent in Afghanistan, with al Qaeda supporting the insurgency from its safe-haven along the Pakistani border. To meet the security needs, the President approved the deployment of a Marine Expeditionary Brigade and an Army Stryker Brigade later in the year, as requested by General McKiernan. The decision to drawdown forces in Iraq allows for increased presence in Afghanistan. The President recognizes the strain this deployment places on troops and military families and promises to provide the necessary support. The troop increase is necessary to stabilize the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan and is part of a comprehensive strategy being developed to achieve clear and achievable objectives in the region. The President emphasizes the importance of working with friends and allies to secure the necessary resources for success.
