National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met with South Sudan's First Vice President Taban Deng to express the US government's commitment to the people of South Sudan. Rice expressed concern about the humanitarian conditions and ongoing fighting in the country, and criticized the South Sudanese government for obstructing the operations of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). She emphasized the need for the rapid deployment of the Regional Protection Force and conveyed the US's deep concern over the alleged involvement of government forces in attacks against humanitarian workers. Rice stressed the importance of identifying and holding accountable the perpetrators of these attacks and called for an urgent investigation with international support. She also highlighted the need for the South Sudanese government to engage in dialogue with opposition groups and govern inclusively, with the strong participation of women and without dominance by a single ethnic group or political party.
