The White House Communications Director, Dan Pfeiffer, issued a statement criticizing the Congressional Republican "Plan B" legislation. Pfeiffer argues that the legislation favors the wealthy by providing large tax cuts for millionaires, while eliminating tax cuts that benefit students, families, and businesses. He also points out that the legislation would cut unemployment assistance and deeply cut Medicare. Pfeiffer states that the deficit reduction is minimal and achieved solely through tax increases, without any spending cuts. He says that the President would veto the legislation if it were to pass. Pfeiffer emphasizes that the President wants a balanced deal that benefits American families, the economy, and the nation's future. He urges Republican leadership to work with the President to find a reasonable solution instead of engaging in political exercises.
