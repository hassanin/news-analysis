Deputy Assistant to the President and Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, Brett McGurk, visited Iraq for two days to consult with political and security leaders. In Baghdad, he met with President Barham Salih, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, and former Speaker Mohammed al-Halbusi. In Erbil, he met with President of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Nechirvan Barzani and other senior leaders. McGurk confirmed President Biden's commitment to the results of the Strategic Dialogue with the Government of Iraq, emphasizing that there are no longer U.S. forces serving in a combat role in Iraq. The transition was possible due to the progress made by Iraqi Security Forces, including the Peshmerga, in the fight against ISIS. Coalition forces remaining in Iraq will be there at the invitation of the Government and their mission will be limited to advising, assisting, and enabling the Iraqi Security Forces to prevent the resurgence of ISIS. McGurk also congratulated the Iraqi people on the centennial anniversary of the establishment of the Iraqi State and reaffirmed the United States' long-term commitment to Iraq under the Strategic Framework Agreement.
