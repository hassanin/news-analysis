President Barack Obama has proclaimed November 15, 2016, as America Recycles Day. The proclamation highlights the importance of reducing, reusing, and recycling waste in order to mitigate pollution, save energy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling not only helps to conserve natural resources but also strengthens the economy and creates green jobs. The proclamation encourages individuals of all ages to do their part by reducing waste and reusing items in their daily lives. The federal government is also taking steps to lead by example and provide resources to businesses, states, and local governments to promote recycling. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to observe America Recycles Day with appropriate programs and activities and to continue their recycling efforts throughout the year.
