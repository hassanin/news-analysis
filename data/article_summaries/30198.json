President Donald J. Trump will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Jim Jordan, recognizing his meritorious contributions to the security and national interests of the United States. Jordan has served in the Ohio State House of Representatives and Senate, and has been a member of the House Oversight Committee. He played a role in uncovering the "Fast and Furious" gun running program, identifying wasteful spending in green energy programs, and fighting against the Justice Department's "Operation Chokepoint." Jordan also led investigations into the IRS targeting conservative organizations and the Benghazi attack, as well as exposing corruption within the Deep State and the origins of the Russia collusion lie. He was named ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee and played a prominent role in confronting the impeachment proceedings. Jordan is considered an inspiration and a consequential member of Congress.
