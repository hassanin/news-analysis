This article is a letter from former President Barack Obama regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Belarus. The letter explains that the government of Belarus has continued to crackdown on political opposition, civil society, and independent media. Citizens have been arbitrarily arrested, detained, and imprisoned for criticizing officials or participating in demonstrations. The government has also prevented independent media from disseminating information. These actions show a regression in democratic governance and respect for human rights. Certain members of the Belarusian government, along with other individuals, are undermining democratic processes, committing human rights abuses, and engaging in public corruption. These actions pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and the related measures blocking the property of certain persons.
