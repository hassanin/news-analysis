This article is a press gaggle en route to Toluca, Mexico, with Press Secretary Jay Carney and Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes. Carney announces that President Obama will sign an executive order on streamlining the export-import process for American businesses. The order cuts processing and approval times from days to minutes for small businesses that export American-made goods and services by completing the International Trade Data System by December 2016. The ITDS will allow businesses to electronically transmit the data required by the U.S. government to import or export cargo, speeding up the shipment of American-made goods overseas and eliminating duplicative paperwork. 
The article also discusses the situation in Ukraine and the U.S. response. The U.S. has made it clear to the Ukrainian government that it is their responsibility to allow for peaceful protest and opposes any use of violence. The U.S. supports Ukraine's orientation towards Europe and a unified government, but also recognizes Ukraine's historic ties to Russia. The U.S. is considering taking action against individuals responsible for acts of violence within Ukraine, including imposing sanctions. The U.S. is coordinating with the European Union on these issues. 
The article briefly mentions other topics that will be discussed at the North American Leaders Summit, such as trade, immigration reform, and security cooperation with Mexico.
