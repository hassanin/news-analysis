The Obama Administration has announced 36 awards totaling $14,546,457 for partnerships in 12 states and tribal nations as part of the Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER) Initiative. The goal of the initiative is to assist communities negatively impacted by changes in the coal industry and power sector by aligning, leveraging, and targeting federal economic and workforce development programs and resources. The awards will support projects that aim to diversify economies, create jobs, attract investment, and provide workforce services and skills training. The projects include initiatives such as broadband infrastructure development, local food supply chain development, substance abuse treatment centers, IT workforce certificate programs, economic diversification plans, and more. The awards are part of President Obama's POWER+ Plan, which proposes a $10 billion investment in coal communities, workers, and technology.
