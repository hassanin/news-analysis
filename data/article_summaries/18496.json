This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama on March 20, 2009, emphasizes the importance of responsible spending of funds allocated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). The memo directs the heads of executive departments and agencies to ensure that funds are distributed based on the merits of proposed projects and not influenced by special interests. It also calls for the development of transparent, merit-based selection criteria for grants and other forms of federal financial assistance. The memo prohibits the use of funds for projects such as casinos, gambling establishments, aquariums, zoos, golf courses, or swimming pools. It also highlights the need for transparency in registered lobbyist communications and requires the posting of written communications from lobbyists on agency recovery websites. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is tasked with assisting and providing guidance to implement the memorandum. The memo does not apply to tax-related provisions in the Recovery Act and is subject to applicable law and OMB guidance.
