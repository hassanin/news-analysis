The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has announced updated guidance for states on administrative costs related to the Recovery Act. The guidance allows states to submit estimated or budgeted costs for administrative expenses, such as maintaining websites and developing reporting databases, either as indirect cost rates or through a billing rate. This new process aims to help states meet the accountability and transparency requirements of the Recovery Act more efficiently. The updated guidance was developed in consultation with state and local officials and will enable states to access funds for administrative costs more quickly, allowing them to invest in staff and technology upfront.
