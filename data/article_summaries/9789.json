One year after the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, President Obama released a statement highlighting the impact of the catastrophe on millions of Americans, including fishermen, business owners, and residents of the region. The administration mobilized the largest oil spill response in U.S. history, with around 48,000 people working to mitigate the damage. Although progress has been made, the recovery efforts are ongoing, with nearly 2,000 responders actively working in the Gulf. BP and other responsible parties are being held accountable for the damages and losses caused. The safety of seafood is being monitored, and new reforms for offshore oil production in the Gulf are being implemented to ensure responsible development of energy resources. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson is leading a task force to coordinate long-term restoration efforts based on input from local scientists, experts, and citizens. The president emphasized the critical link between the environment and the economic health of the Gulf and expressed the administration's commitment to protecting and restoring the Gulf Coast. The statement also honored the lives lost in the tragedy and thanked the responders who worked to mitigate the disaster.
