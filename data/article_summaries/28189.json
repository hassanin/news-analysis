President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order to protect American investors from funding Communist Chinese military companies. This includes companies designated by the Department of Defense in June and August of 2020. The order aims to prevent individual investors in the United States from unknowingly providing funds to these companies through passive institutional investment vehicles like mutual funds and retirement plans. The President's action is intended to safeguard American investors from inadvertently supporting the People's Liberation Army and Chinese intelligence services, which frequently target American citizens and businesses through cyber operations. This action is also aimed at protecting the critical infrastructure, economy, and military of the United States, as well as its allies and partners worldwide.
