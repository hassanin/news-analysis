The White House Office of Public Engagement recently organized a meeting with over 90 Latino leaders from the Venezuelan community. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the ongoing efforts and investments of the Biden-Harris Administration within the Latino community. 

During the meeting, the first panel focused on the administration's efforts to expand legal pathways, such as the expansion and redesignation of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans, as well as the parole program for Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians, and Venezuelans. Participants also shared their personal stories about these programs.

In the second panel, Biden-Harris Administration officials discussed how President Biden's economic agenda, referred to as "Bidenomics," is creating economic opportunities for Latinos. They outlined various initiatives that aim to provide equitable access to government programs, including the Department of Health and Human Services' Language Access Plan, the Small Business Digital Alliance, and the Hispanic Initiative for Educational Excellence. The officials also highlighted the administration's efforts to expand healthcare coverage, particularly reproductive healthcare.

The Biden-Harris Administration officials expressed their commitment to working with the Latino community to advance equity and deliver on the President's efforts.
