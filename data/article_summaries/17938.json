On February 23, 2012, the White House issued a notice to continue the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels. The national emergency was initially declared on March 1, 1996, in response to the destruction of two unarmed U.S. registered civilian aircraft by the Cuban government in international airspace. The emergency was extended in 2004 to deny monetary and material support to the Cuban government. The continuation of the national emergency is due to concerns that the Cuban government may use excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft involved in memorial activities or peaceful protests near Cuba. Additionally, unauthorized entry of U.S. registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is deemed detrimental to U.S. foreign policy. The notice was issued in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
