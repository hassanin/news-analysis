The Biden administration has released its National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, which outlines four key goals for the path ahead in fighting the pandemic. The goals are to protect against and treat COVID-19, prepare for new variants, prevent economic and school shutdowns, and vaccinate the world and save lives. The plan emphasizes the importance of vaccines, boosters, and treatments in protecting against severe illness and hospitalization. It also highlights the need for additional funding and congressional support to execute the plan effectively. The administration is focused on expanding access to vaccines, treatments, tests, and high-quality masks, as well as addressing the long-term impacts of COVID-19, such as Long COVID and mental health. The plan also emphasizes the importance of global vaccination efforts and the need to protect against future pandemics. The administration will continue to monitor the virus through various surveillance systems and adjust its response as needed. The plan aims to move the country forward safely and gradually return to more normal routines.
