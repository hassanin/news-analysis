President Obama has declared a major disaster in Puerto Rico and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms, flooding, mudslides, and landslides caused by Tropical Storm Otto. Federal funding will be available to the Commonwealth and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive funding. Justo Hern√°ndez has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
