The Supreme Court's decision in Sackett v. EPA is seen as disappointing and detrimental to the protection of wetlands and water sources in the United States. The decision puts the country's wetlands, as well as the rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds connected to them, at risk of pollution and destruction. This jeopardizes the clean water sources that millions of American families, farmers, and businesses rely on. The Clean Water Act, which was passed in 1972 with bipartisan support, has been utilized by both Republican and Democratic administrations to ensure clean water for all Americans. The decision in Sackett v. EPA undermines the legal framework that has safeguarded the nation's waters for decades and disregards scientific evidence highlighting the crucial role of wetlands in protecting streams, rivers, and lakes from harmful chemicals and pollutants. Efforts will be made to review the decision and utilize every legal authority available to protect the country's waters. Collaboration with states, cities, and Tribal communities will be sought to pass and uphold essential protections for their residents. The fight for clean water for all will continue through initiatives such as the Investing in America agenda, which aims to allocate resources to communities across the country to address issues like lead pipes, water quality improvement, and the rebuilding of drinking water infrastructure.
