President Obama has declared a state of emergency in Florida due to the emergency conditions resulting from Hurricane Matthew. This declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to save lives, protect property and public health, and lessen the threat of a catastrophe. FEMA is authorized to identify and provide necessary equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. The federal funding for emergency protective measures will be provided at 75 percent. Terry L. Quarles has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
