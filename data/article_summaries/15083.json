The White House has announced its intent to suspend Argentina as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. This decision is based on Argentina's failure to enforce arbitral awards in favor of U.S. owned companies. The President has determined that Argentina has not acted in good faith in this matter and therefore the suspension is warranted.
