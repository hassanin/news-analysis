This article discusses an executive order issued by President Biden to address the issues of high-quality early care and education and long-term care in the United States. The order emphasizes the importance of these types of care for economic growth, national security, and the well-being of families and individuals. It acknowledges that many families struggle to access affordable, high-quality care due to the gap between the costs of providing care and what families can afford to pay. The order also recognizes the challenges faced by the care workforce, including low pay, high turnover, and limited access to benefits. 

The order directs various government agencies to take actions aimed at increasing compensation and job quality for caregivers, expanding access to affordable care for families, and providing more care options. It calls for improved support and resources for family caregivers, expanded training and professional development opportunities for care workers, and the development of innovative funding and financial assistance programs. The order also seeks to improve data collection and analysis on the care workforce and explore ways to streamline processes and increase funding for care services.

Additionally, the order emphasizes the need to expand options for families by building the supply of care. It calls for rulemaking to improve access to home- and community-based services, policies to support child care providers, and the development of high-quality early learning programs. The order also encourages private financial institutions to support care providers and calls for increased coordination and capacity-building at the local level.

Overall, the executive order aims to address the challenges faced by families, caregivers, and the care workforce, and to improve access to affordable, high-quality care in the United States.
