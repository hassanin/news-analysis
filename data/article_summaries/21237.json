The President's statement acknowledges the end of the holy pilgrimage of Hajj in Mecca and extends warm wishes to Muslims around the world celebrating Eid al-Adha. The significance of this pilgrimage and Eid is highlighted as being about sacrifice, almsgiving, and equality. The experience of Muslims traveling to Mecca and Medina, leaving behind their valuables and dressing in simple white cloth, symbolizes the principle that no single person is more worthy than another. The President draws a parallel with the principle upon which the United States is built, emphasizing the strength of diversity. Eid is also a time to give food, shelter, and health services to those in need, and Muslim Americans are commended for their efforts to assist those suffering from hunger and conflict, both domestically and abroad. The President concludes by expressing hope that prayers for peace, from those on pilgrimage and of all beliefs, will be heard and answered.
