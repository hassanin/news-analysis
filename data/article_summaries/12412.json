The White House Press Secretary released a statement recognizing the Holodomor, a famine that occurred in Ukraine during Joseph Stalin's regime. The statement acknowledges the millions of Ukrainians who starved to death due to the Soviet regime's seizure of crops and refusal to provide food relief. Despite the suffering, Ukrainians remained committed to their drive for freedom and independence. The statement highlights Ukraine's ongoing struggle for freedom and democracy and emphasizes the importance of remembering the past to prevent future atrocities. It also mentions a memorial in Washington, D.C., that allows Americans to reflect on the Holodomor and their shared determination to build a better world.
