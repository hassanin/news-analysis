The United States and Japan established a bilateral Nuclear Security Working Group (NSWG) in 2011 to strengthen nuclear security worldwide. The group developed a Roadmap with nine goals to achieve this, including reducing nuclear material quantities, enhancing response capabilities, and sharing best practices. Some achievements include cooperation in non-proliferation and nuclear security training, research and development in nuclear forensics, and cooperation on safeguards implementation. The two countries also collaborated on transport security, reactor conversion to reduce highly enriched uranium (HEU) use, and implementing nuclear security recommendations. They conducted joint studies on reducing the attractiveness of nuclear materials and plan to conduct peer reviews with France and the United Kingdom. Overall, these efforts have improved nuclear security expertise, reduced vulnerabilities, and minimized the threat of terrorists acquiring nuclear material.
