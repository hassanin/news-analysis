President Biden has signed an executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to explore additional actions to lower prescription drug costs. This comes as part of the administration's efforts to lower healthcare costs for working and middle-class families. The executive order aims to build on the Inflation Reduction Act, which has already implemented measures such as lowering health insurance premiums and capping out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. It also allows Medicare to negotiate prices for high-cost prescription drugs for the first time. The executive order further directs HHS to consider using the Innovation Center's authorities to test new ways of paying for Medicare services that improve care quality while reducing costs. The goal is to provide more affordable access to innovative drug therapies for Medicare beneficiaries. The executive order also coincides with the start of Medicare Open Enrollment season, where seniors can take advantage of the cost-saving provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act as they shop for new health insurance plans.
