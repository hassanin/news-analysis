International Women's Day is a reminder that women and girls are crucial to the success and progress of society. Promoting opportunities for them strengthens security, stability, and prosperity for everyone. However, women's rights are still under attack in many parts of the world, such as Afghanistan and Iran. The United States is committed to protecting and advancing human rights for women and girls globally. Initiatives are being implemented to expand economic security, access to healthcare, political participation, and human rights for women. Efforts are also being made to eliminate gender-based violence and provide protection services in humanitarian emergencies. In the United States, landmark investments have been made to support women's participation in the labor force and provide workplace protections for pregnant and nursing workers. Legislation, such as the Violence Against Women Act, has been strengthened to ensure access to services, justice, and healing for survivors. The United States is focused on lifting up the rights of women and girls through both foreign and domestic policies, reflecting the values of the nation. The aim is to create a future where women have equal opportunities and representation in decision-making processes.
