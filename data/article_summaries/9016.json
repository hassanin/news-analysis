North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature has passed an abortion ban that could hinder the doctor-patient relationship and restrict access to care for women, particularly in the South. The details of the ban have been obscured, but it is believed to make it more difficult for women to receive necessary medical care. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, women have been denied vital healthcare, forced to travel long distances for treatment, and left with complications that could affect their future fertility. These consequences are a result of extreme state-level abortion bans. President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to fighting for the restoration of Roe protections at the federal level.
