In this press briefing, the White House Press Secretary discusses the savings that millions of consumers have seen due to provisions in the Affordable Care Act. The law requires insurance companies to spend at least 80% of premiums on medical care and efforts to improve care. If they don't, they must send consumers a refund. Almost 80 million consumers saved $3.4 billion on their premiums in 2012. The law also requires insurance companies to publicly justify rate increases of 10% or more. The Press Secretary also discusses the upcoming debt ceiling fight and the President's position that he will not negotiate over raising the debt ceiling. He mentions that Congressman Paul Ryan and Senator Patty Murray deserve credit for reaching a compromise on the budget deal. The Press Secretary also talks about the progress being made on comprehensive immigration reform and the need for Congress to pass it. Finally, he mentions the President's commitment to reducing gun violence and the need for Congress to take action on common-sense measures.
