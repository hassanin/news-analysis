President Obama has announced his intention to nominate John B. King as Secretary of Education. King is an accomplished educator who has served as a teacher, principal, leader of a network of schools, and the State Commissioner of Education in New York. His belief in the power of education comes from his own life experience, as both of his parents were career educators in New York City. King currently serves as the Acting Secretary of Education and Principal Senior Advisor at the Department of Education. During his time as Commissioner in New York State, King implemented various changes that benefited students, including grants to support teacher leadership and initiatives to reduce unnecessary tests. He also co-founded a successful charter school in Massachusetts. King holds multiple degrees, including a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School, and lives in Maryland with his wife and two children.
