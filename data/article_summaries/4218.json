The President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. The original national emergency was declared in 1995 due to the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, which were deemed a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. Over the years, additional executive orders have been issued to impose sanctions and respond to Iran's activities. The government of Iran's proliferation of missiles, development of weapons capabilities, regional aggression, support for terrorist groups, and the activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its surrogates are still considered an unusual and extraordinary threat. Therefore, the national emergency will continue for another year. This notice is separate from the emergency declared in 1979 in connection with the hostage crisis.
