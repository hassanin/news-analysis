First Lady Michelle Obama will be delivering remarks at the 84th Winter Meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors at the Capital Hilton in Washington, DC. She will be discussing the Administration's efforts to end veteran homelessness and the importance of mayoral leadership in this process. The Administration set the goal of preventing and ending homelessness among veterans in 2010. Through the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness, over 800 mayors and other state and local leaders have committed to working together to end veteran homelessness in their communities.
