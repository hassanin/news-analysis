Vice President Joe Biden commends George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, Sam Nunn, and William Perry for their continued work on nuclear non-proliferation. He emphasizes the importance of their contributions to national security and their commitment to pursuing a world without nuclear weapons. Biden states that the spread of nuclear weapons to additional states and terrorists is the greatest threat facing the American people, and that the government will spare no effort in protecting the country from this danger. He highlights the strength of bipartisanship and how it has supported the nation during the Cold War and after the 9/11 attacks. Biden acknowledges that these four statesmen have shown the path to improved security by preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and strengthening the nonproliferation regime while maintaining a safe and effective nuclear arsenal. He mentions upcoming events, such as the release of a new budget, the Nuclear Posture Review, and the Nuclear Security Summit, where the government will demonstrate the consensus they have sought. Biden encourages members from both parties to embrace these policies and to learn from the wisdom of these esteemed statesmen.
