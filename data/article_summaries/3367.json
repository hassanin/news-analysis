President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to global illicit drug trafficking, declared in Executive Order 14059 on December 15, 2021, is to continue beyond December 15, 2022. The President highlights the significant impact of illicit drugs, particularly fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, on the American population, causing tens of thousands of deaths annually and countless non-fatal overdoses. Drug cartels, transnational criminal organizations, and their facilitators are identified as the main sources of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals, contributing to the opioid epidemic and drug-related violence in communities. The President asserts that international drug trafficking, including the illegal production, global sale, and widespread distribution of illegal drugs, the emergence of potent substances like fentanyl, and the increasing role of internet-based drug sales, poses an extraordinary threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. Hence, the President deems it necessary to continue the national emergency.
