The President has made a determination regarding the supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. According to a report from the Energy Information Administration, the tightness in the oil market has relaxed somewhat in recent months. While production disruptions and concerns about Iran's nuclear activities have increased demand for non-Iranian crude oil, production increases in other countries and weaker demand growth overall have helped mitigate the tightness in the oil market. There appears to be sufficient supply of non-Iranian oil to allow foreign countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil. Many purchasers of Iranian crude oil have already reduced their purchases or are in discussions with alternative suppliers.
