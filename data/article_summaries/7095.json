The article is a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House (or the President) regarding the continuation of a national emergency declared in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act states that a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and transmits it to Congress stating that the emergency is to continue. The President has sent the notice to the Federal Register, stating that the emergency will continue for an additional year beyond the anniversary date. The letter explains that the terrorist threat that led to the declaration of the national emergency in 2001 still persists, necessitating its continuation. The letter is signed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
