President Trump recently gave a commencement address to graduates of the "Hope for Prisoners" program in Las Vegas. He emphasized the importance of redemption and second chances, stating that America believes in helping former inmates rebuild their lives. President Trump is seen as a champion for criminal justice reform, having signed the First Step Act in 2018, which reformed sentencing guidelines and invested in prisoner rehabilitation programs. He also highlighted the administration's campaign for Second Chance Hiring, encouraging businesses to hire returning citizens. The strong labor market under the Trump Administration has led to more job openings than unemployed people, with over 7 million jobs added to the economy since the 2016 election. This has resulted in significant increases in net worth for the bottom 50 percent of households, surpassing the rate of increase for the top 1 percent.
