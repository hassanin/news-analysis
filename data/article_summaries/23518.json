President Obama has signed a Presidential Memorandum establishing a policy that the impacts of climate change must be considered in the development of national security-related doctrine, policies, and plans. This memorandum directs 20 federal agencies and offices to collaborate and ensure the best information on climate impacts is available to strengthen national security. The National Intelligence Council has also released a report stating that climate change will likely pose significant national security challenges for the United States over the next two decades. These challenges include political instability, conflicts over resources, migrations, and strained capacity for delivering humanitarian assistance. The memorandum establishes a Federal Climate and National Security Working Group to identify national security priorities related to climate change and develop an action plan. Individual agencies are also directed to develop implementation plans addressing climate-related hazards and threats to national security.
