The article discusses the vaccination requirements implemented by the administration to combat COVID-19. The requirements were initially applied to members of the Armed Forces, federal workers, contractors, health care workers, and employees in large firms. The article highlights the success of the vaccination efforts, as the number of unvaccinated Americans has decreased from 90 million to under 35 million. The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the vaccination requirement for health care workers is seen as a measure that will save lives. However, the Court has blocked the implementation of similar requirements for employees at large businesses. As a result, it is now up to states and individual employers to determine whether to enforce vaccination requirements. The article concludes by urging business leaders to implement vaccination requirements to protect their workers, customers, and communities.
