This press briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney covers a range of topics, including the sequester cuts, discussions with lawmakers, the President's upcoming trip to Israel, Iran's nuclear program, and the controversy surrounding Organizing for Action. Carney emphasizes the negative impacts of the sequester cuts and argues that Republicans are to blame for allowing them to take effect. He also discusses the possibility of a grand bargain on deficit reduction and the President's focus on achieving bipartisan support for key policy objectives. Carney dismisses the idea that there is a price for meeting with the President and defends the existence of Organizing for Action. He also addresses Dennis Rodman's recent trip to North Korea and Mitt Romney's comments about the 2012 election.
