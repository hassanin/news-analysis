The White House has announced new commitments to the Fair Chance Business Pledge and actions to improve the criminal justice system. The Fair Chance Business Pledge encourages companies to eliminate unnecessary hiring barriers for individuals with criminal records. Over 300 companies have signed the pledge, including Ben & Jerry's, Gap, Intel, LinkedIn, Target, and Tyson Foods. Additionally, Glassdoor has created a Fair Chance Pledge badge for companies to display on their profiles. The Office of Personnel Management is finalizing a "Ban the Box" rule for federal jobs, which delays the inquiry about an applicant's criminal history until a conditional offer is made. The Federal Bureau of Prisons is implementing reforms to reduce recidivism and increase successful reentry into the community. The White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable has issued its first annual report, documenting efforts to integrate civil legal aid into programs serving low-income and vulnerable individuals.
