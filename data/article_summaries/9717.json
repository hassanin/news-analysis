The White House has issued a statement criticizing the legislation put forward by House Republicans regarding the issue of unaccompanied children apprehended at the border. The statement argues that the legislation does not responsibly address the problem and could result in the deportation of hundreds of thousands of young people who were brought to the country as children. It also highlights the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which prioritizes deporting dangerous criminals rather than these young people. The statement expresses disappointment that House Republicans are demanding a reversal of this prioritization as a condition for providing resources to deal with the humanitarian situation at the border. It further criticizes the legislation as partisan and unlikely to be accepted by the Senate. The statement concludes by emphasizing the need for Congressional action to fix the broken immigration system and calling on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation upon returning from recess.
