The White House has announced a series of commitments and executive actions to promote solar deployment and energy efficiency. These actions aim to cut carbon pollution by nearly 300 million metric tons through 2030 and save homes and businesses more than $10 billion on their energy bills. The executive actions include partnering with military bases to create a veterans solar job training pilot, investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in rural areas, proposing energy conservation standards for commercial unit air conditioners, supporting funding for clean energy and energy efficiency in affordable housing, strengthening building codes, and leveraging national service and volunteerism to tackle climate change. Additionally, 50 companies, states, communities, and multifamily housing leaders are announcing commitments to deploy onsite solar energy and improve energy efficiency. These commitments represent more than 35 megawatts of solar deployed and energy efficiency investments that will lower energy bills for more than 400 million square feet of buildings. Since President Obama took office, America has increased its electricity generation from solar more than ten-fold, and the price of commercial and residential solar has declined by more than 12 percent in 2013 alone. The White House is also launching various initiatives to drive solar deployment, improve financing options, and increase federal procurement of solar.
