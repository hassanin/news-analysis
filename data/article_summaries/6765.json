President Biden and G7 leaders, along with the European Union, are announcing new economic actions to hold Russian President Putin accountable for his actions in Ukraine and to isolate Russia from the global financial system. These actions include revoking Russia's Most-Favored Nation status, denying borrowing privileges at multilateral financial institutions, imposing full blocking sanctions on Russian elites and their family members, banning the export of luxury goods to Russia, banning the import of goods from several sectors of Russia's economy, providing guidance to prevent sanctions evasion through virtual currency, and creating the authority to ban new investments in any sector of the Russian economy. These measures aim to increase pressure on Putin and build on the existing economic sanctions imposed by the United States and over 30 other countries. The goal is to make Russia a global economic and financial pariah and ensure that Putin's war of choice is a strategic failure.
