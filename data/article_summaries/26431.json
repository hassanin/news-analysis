The editorial discusses a proposed immigration reform bill called the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy Act (RAISE). The bill, supported by President Trump and Republican senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, aims to reduce the number of immigrants who receive legal permanent residence in the US by half over the next decade. It would eliminate immigration preferences for family members and adult children of American citizens, cap the number of refugees accepted at 50,000, and eliminate the diversity lottery program. Conservative advocacy groups argue that the bill will create a smarter immigration system and protect American workers. The editorial emphasizes that while America is a nation of immigrants, it's important to maintain harmony and good order by implementing immigration policies that are fair and sustainable.
