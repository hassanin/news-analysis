According to data released by the Commerce Department, the U.S. economy grew at a faster-than-expected rate of 3.5% in the third quarter. This growth was attributed to controlled inflation and a surge in consumer spending. Economists had predicted a growth rate of 3.4%. The PCE price index, a measure of inflation, increased by 1.6% in the last quarter, lower than the expected 2.2%. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew by 4%, the strongest since the fourth quarter of 2014.
