The President and First Lady are offering their condolences to the Enoch City, Utah community following a tragic shooting that resulted in the deaths of five children and multiple adults. Gun violence remains a major issue in America, with it being the leading cause of death for children. President Biden has taken executive action to address this issue, including promoting safe firearm storage and preventing suicide. He has also signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. The Act provides tools for communities to reduce gun violence, such as extreme risk protection orders. However, the President believes more needs to be done, including enacting an assault weapons and high-capacity magazine ban, requiring safe storage of firearms, and closing loopholes in the gun background check system related to dating violence restraining orders.
