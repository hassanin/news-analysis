The Biden-Harris Administration has established a new Cabinet-level White House Methane Task Force to address the urgent need to reduce methane emissions. The first-ever White House Methane Summit is being convened to focus on the reduction of methane emissions, particularly from leaks in the oil and gas sector. The goal is to protect public health, create jobs, save consumers money, and advance President Biden's climate agenda. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide and can have serious public health impacts. Methane leaks also result in billions of dollars' worth of wasted natural gas annually. The summit will explore opportunities to detect emissions using innovative technologies and tools, as well as lead international efforts on methane management. The Global Methane Pledge, a partnership between the US and the European Union, aims to collectively cut methane emissions by 30% compared to 2020 levels by 2030.
