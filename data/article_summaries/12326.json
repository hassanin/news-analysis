The article discusses an agreement signed by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Steven Chu to streamline and coordinate federal weatherization programs. The collaboration aims to make it easier for low-income families to weatherize their homes, saving money and creating green jobs. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed today represents a longer-term partnership between the agencies to make weatherization more cost-effective. The collaboration will minimize administrative barriers and simplify the process for residents of HUD public and assisted housing seeking to weatherize their homes. This partnership aligns with President Obama's goal of making government work better for all Americans. The agreement will also impact rural communities, providing heating, cooling, and energy efficiency for residents. The income verification process for weatherization funds in HUD-assisted housing will be conducted only once, breaking down bureaucratic barriers. The Recovery Act provides funding to improve energy efficiency in existing homes, including $5 billion for the Weatherization Assistance Program. The collaboration between HUD and DOE will coordinate funding for this program, as well as other energy efficiency efforts. The partnership aims to accelerate the deployment of energy-efficient and green building technologies while creating a qualified workforce. This announcement is just one step in an ongoing partnership between the two agencies, which will continue to provide guidance on energy efficiency programs and develop new financing products.
