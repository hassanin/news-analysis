The United States and Angola are celebrating 30 years of diplomatic relations and have been deepening their bilateral relationship. They have been engaging in frequent high-level engagements and increasing cooperation on shared objectives. The partnership between the two countries is critical for economic prosperity, regional security, and energy security in Africa and the Atlantic.

One of the highlights of the past year has been the partnership between the United States and Angola in establishing strategic economic corridors that benefit local populations and integrate them into the global economy. The Lobito Corridor, which runs from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Atlantic Ocean, is a transformative economic corridor that offers potential for critical infrastructure development and investment in underdeveloped regions of Angola.

The United States has also been working with Angola to increase food security and climate resilience through building capacity and expanding investment in the agriculture sector. Additionally, the United States is investing in Angola's digital architecture to improve its digital connectivity to the global economy.

The United States supports Angola's efforts to combat corruption, enhance accountability, advance democratic governance, and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms. Angola has made ambitious environmental and conservation commitments, with U.S. support, as it aims to generate 73 percent of its energy from clean sources by 2027.

The United States and Angola have a longstanding partnership in health, particularly in combating malaria and HIV/AIDS. They also collaborate on peace and security initiatives.

Overall, the United States and Angola have been working closely together on various fronts to advance their shared goals and strengthen their bilateral relationship.
