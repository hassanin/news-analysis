In honor of National Stalking Awareness Month, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recognizes the strength and resilience of stalking survivors and reaffirms the commitment to creating a future where everyone can live free from fear, threats, and abuse. Stalking is described as an abuse of power that affects one in three women and one in six men in their lifetimes. It can occur in person or online, and it can be perpetrated by strangers or individuals known to the victim. Stalking can have a devastating impact on the sense of security and well-being of its victims, often forcing them to relocate. President Biden highlights his work on the Violence Against Women Act and the recent reauthorization of the law, which provides increased support for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The President also emphasizes the importance of addressing online harassment and cybercrime through the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse. Additionally, President Biden released America's first National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence, which focuses on prevention, healing, housing, online safety, the justice system, crisis response, and data. The Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women and the Department of Housing and Urban Development have provided grants and resources to combat stalking and assist victims. The proclamation encourages all Americans to speak out against stalking and support the efforts of advocates, courts, service providers, and law enforcement to help victims and hold perpetrators accountable.
