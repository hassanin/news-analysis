The Supreme Court's decision in Haaland v. Brackeen is being hailed as a victory for Tribal sovereignty and Native communities. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) was established to address the historical removal of Native children from their families and communities, which not only violated their basic human rights but also threatened the existence of Tribal Nations. As the District Attorney of San Francisco and later as the Attorney General of California, the author has witnessed the importance of ICWA in protecting the safety and well-being of Native children. The author, along with President Biden, pledges to continue fighting for the protection of Native families, children, and communities, as well as upholding Tribal sovereignty.
