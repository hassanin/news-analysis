President Obama called Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper to receive an update on the flooding situation in Colorado and express his concern for the affected citizens. The President offered his condolences to those who lost loved ones and praised the first responders for their efforts. He assured the Governor that the federal government will provide necessary support and declared a major disaster in Colorado, authorizing Federal aid for recovery efforts. The FEMA Administrator will travel to Colorado to coordinate with state and local response teams. FEMA has already deployed personnel and resources to assist with search and rescue operations. They have also stocked up on supplies, such as water and meals, to distribute as needed. The public is advised to stay updated on weather conditions, follow instructions from local officials, and take necessary precautions to ensure their safety.
