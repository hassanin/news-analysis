President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 2012 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. The proclamation recognizes the thousands of American women who lose their lives to ovarian cancer each year and calls for increased awareness and action to lessen the toll this disease takes on families. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of early detection and provides information on the risk factors and symptoms associated with ovarian cancer. The administration is committed to investing in research, raising awareness through campaigns, and ensuring access to healthcare for women with ovarian cancer. The proclamation urges citizens, government agencies, healthcare providers, and research institutions to join in raising awareness and supporting efforts to prevent, detect, and treat ovarian cancer.
