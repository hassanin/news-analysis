The Peace Corps is expanding its program in Indonesia as part of the U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership. Currently, there are 43 volunteers teaching English in East Java, but by June 2012, the number of volunteers will increase to 70. The program plans to expand to other provinces in the future, such as South Sulawesi, West Java, and Banten. Additionally, the Peace Corps and the Indonesian government are working together to develop a second program sector, such as community health, environment, or youth and community development. The Peace Corps originally had a program in Indonesia in 1963, but it closed in 1965 due to political unrest. The program was re-established in 2010, and a formal Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 2009.
