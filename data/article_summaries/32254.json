In a speech delivered in the East Room on June 5, 2017, President Trump discussed plans to modernize air travel and improve the air traffic control system in the United States. He highlighted the need to reduce delays, increase route efficiency, and improve reliability and affordability of air travel. The President proposed turning over the air traffic control system to a self-financing, non-profit organization, which would focus on route efficiency and reducing delays, while the Federal Aviation Administration would concentrate on safety. The President emphasized the importance of providing air traffic controllers with superior equipment and the best technology available. He also mentioned the success of other countries, such as Canada, in modernizing their air traffic control systems through non-government organizations. President Trump believes that these reforms will lead to cheaper, faster, and safer travel and provide an economic boost for the country.
