On February 12, 2014, President Obama declared an emergency in the State of South Carolina due to a severe winter storm that began on February 10, 2014. The declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts to help the local population. FEMA is authorized to mobilize equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. The federal government will provide 75 percent funding for emergency protective measures. Joe M. Girot has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
