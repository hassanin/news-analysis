President Trump has announced updated guidelines to slow the spread of Coronavirus in America. These guidelines, developed by public health experts, emphasize the importance of social distancing, economic support for workers, medical intervention, innovation, and travel restrictions. The next 30 days are crucial, and if every American follows these guidelines, it is estimated that 1 million or more lives could be saved. The goal is to manage the outbreak and ultimately defeat the virus. President Trump believes that by doing their patriotic duty, every American can help achieve a total victory.
