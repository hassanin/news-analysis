The Department of Labor is finalizing a rule that will update overtime protections for workers. The new rule is expected to extend overtime protections to 4.2 million more Americans and boost wages by $12 billion over the next 10 years. The rule, which takes effect on December 1, 2016, doubles the salary threshold for overtime eligibility from $23,660 to $47,476 per year. It will also be automatically updated every three years to ensure workers continue to earn the pay they deserve. The rule aims to strengthen the middle class and raise Americans' wages. The Department of Labor has taken into account input from public comments and meetings with various stakeholders. The rule will raise wages for workers, provide flexibility for employers to comply with the rule, and extend overtime protections to more workers. The Department of Labor will also release guidance documents to help employers come into compliance with the new rule.
