The article discusses a proclamation issued by President Donald Trump regarding the domestic solar industry in the United States. The proclamation is based on reports from the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) on the impact of safeguard measures on the industry. The ITC found that prices for solar cells and modules declined following the imposition of safeguard measures but were still higher than they would have been without the measures. Imports of solar cells increased, leading to a decline in domestic production capacity. However, imports of solar modules initially declined but rose in the first half of 2019. The ITC also found that the exclusion of bifacial modules from the safeguard measures would likely result in increased imports of such modules, which would compete with domestically produced products. Based on these findings, President Trump has determined that the domestic industry has begun to make positive adjustments to import competition. As a result, he has revoked the exclusion of bifacial panels from the safeguard tariff and adjusted the duty rate for the fourth year of the safeguard measure. The modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) will go into effect 15 days after the proclamation is issued.
