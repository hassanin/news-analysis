The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has released a report highlighting the limitations of traditional wage measures and how they underestimate compensation growth for American workers. The report identifies four concerns about traditional wage measures and their impact on observed compensation growth. 

First, official wage statistics often do not include additional benefits such as bonus pay, health insurance, and contributions to retirement savings. These benefits have become a larger part of compensation in recent years, leading to greater overall compensation growth than what is seen in cash wages alone. 

Second, new workers entering the workforce or returning after a period of not working typically have lower wages due to their lack of experience. This creates the appearance of lower wage growth when measuring the average wage at a given point in time, even though workers are actually experiencing higher wage growth. 

Third, when measuring real wages, it is important to accurately measure inflation. The report suggests using the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCEPI) instead of the commonly reported Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers, as the former shows faster real wage growth. 

Finally, the report acknowledges that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 has resulted in lower personal income taxes, which are not reflected in official wage statistics. As a result, real after-tax income has been rising faster than pre-tax income. 

After adjusting for these factors, the report finds that real compensation growth over the past year has been substantially higher than indicated by headline wage measures. Real average hourly after-tax compensation has increased by 1.4 percent, and an alternative approach using the Atlanta Federal Reserve's Wage Growth Tracker suggests a growth of 1.9 percent over the same period.
