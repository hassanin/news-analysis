President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Utah due to a severe storm that occurred between November 30 and December 1, 2011. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in Davis County, where the storm caused significant damage. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Gary R. Stanley has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
