President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. has declared a major disaster in the State of Florida due to the impact of Hurricane Ian. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The declaration makes federal funding available to individuals in several counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, can also receive federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures. Hazard mitigation measures will be funded on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Thomas J. McCool has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional areas may receive assistance after assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance through various channels, such as DisasterAssistance.gov and the FEMA App.
