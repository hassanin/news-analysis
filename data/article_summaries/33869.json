The President of the United States has ordered precision strikes on targets in Syria associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The strikes are a combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom. The President stated that the purpose of the strikes is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons. He also called out Iran and Russia for supporting the Assad regime and stated that the nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep. The President emphasized that the United States does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria and that as other nations step up their contributions, the U.S. looks forward to bringing its troops home. He concluded by asking Americans to pray for the warriors and allies carrying out the missions and for the region to find peace.
