President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance in Mississippi following severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes that occurred in March 2023. The increase in funding applies to debris removal and emergency protective measures, with the federal government covering 100% of the eligible costs for a continuous 30-day period chosen by the state within the first 120 days after the incident.
