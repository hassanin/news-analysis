The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a press briefing on March 5, 2013. During the briefing, Press Secretary Jay Carney discussed several topics. First, he mentioned that the United States Senate will hold a cloture vote on the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Carney expressed disappointment that a cloture vote is necessary for someone as well-qualified as Halligan. He also mentioned that the court is currently understaffed and urged the Senate to support an up or down vote for Halligan. 

Carney also noted that President Obama will sign the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act on Thursday. He emphasized the importance of the law in strengthening the criminal justice system's response to crimes against women. 

Additionally, Carney discussed the release of OLC memos on drones to the Senate Intelligence Committee. He stated that the White House worked with the committee to provide information about legal advice and meet their concerns. Carney also mentioned that the President believes John Brennan, the nominee for CIA director, is highly qualified and urged the committee to vote on his confirmation. 

Carney addressed questions about the budget, the sequester, and the economy. He emphasized the need for a balanced approach to deficit reduction and expressed frustration with the Republican Party's refusal to agree on a compromise. Carney also discussed the Dow reaching a record high and stated that the economy is poised to grow and create jobs if Washington does not hinder progress. 

Other topics mentioned during the briefing include North Korea, Venezuela, immigration reform, and negotiations with Iran.
