Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden are embarking on a week-long trip to Finland, Russia, and Moldova. The purpose of the trip is to meet with key leaders in each country and discuss various bilateral, regional, and international issues. In Helsinki, the Vice President will consult with Finnish partners on shared regional and global priorities. In Moscow, he will focus on building on the "reset" in U.S.-Russian relations and promoting the prosperity of both countries. In Moldova, the Bidens will show support for ongoing democratic and economic reforms and Moldova's aspirations for European integration. The schedule includes meetings with leaders, visits to educational institutions, wreath-laying ceremonies, roundtable discussions, and a speech on U.S.-Russia relations. Dr. Jill Biden will also participate in events focusing on education and women's empowerment.
