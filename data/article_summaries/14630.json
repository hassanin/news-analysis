The United States is concerned about the recent events surrounding the "Strategy 31" protests in Russia. Dozens of people were reportedly detained, including some who were not even participating in the demonstrations. There are also accusations of mistreatment and beatings of protestors by the police. The United States is troubled by these actions, as they go against the right to peaceful assembly and the fundamental rights of citizens enshrined in the Russian constitution and international commitments. The US is also concerned about the raid and criminal investigation launched against the organizers and activists of the Strategy 31 campaign. These actions are seen as intimidation and threaten the aspirations of people. The US urges the Russian government to protect the freedoms of expression and assembly for all citizens.
