On June 26, 2008, President Obama declared a national emergency with respect to North Korea due to the threat of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The President also found it necessary to maintain certain restrictions with respect to North Korea that would otherwise have been lifted. 

In 2010, the national emergency was expanded to address the threat posed by the actions and policies of the North Korean government, including the sinking of a South Korean Navy ship, nuclear tests, missile launches, and violations of United Nations Security Council Resolutions. 

Additional steps were taken in 2011, 2015, and 2016 to address the national emergency, including import restrictions and sanctions. The President determined that the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, as well as the actions and policies of the North Korean government, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2008 and subsequent executive orders must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2016. The President is continuing the national emergency for one year in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
