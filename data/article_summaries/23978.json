On December 13, 2011, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 2192, called the "National Guard and Reservist Debt Relief Extension Act of 2011," extends the exemption for members of the Armed Forces reserves and the National Guard from a means-test presumption of abuse in determining eligibility for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief. This exemption will now last for an additional four years until December 18, 2015. To be eligible for this exemption, the members must have been on active duty or performing a homeland defense activity for at least 90 days after September 11, 2001.

The second bill, S. 1541, modifies the membership requirements for the Blue Star Mothers of America, Inc. The exact details of the modifications are not specified in the statement.

The third bill, S. 1639, authorizes the American Legion to provide guidance and leadership to its organizations and local chapters. However, it prohibits the American Legion from controlling or otherwise influencing their specific activities and conduct.
