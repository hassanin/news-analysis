President Biden will issue an executive order that prohibits the operational use of commercial spyware by U.S. government departments and agencies. The executive order aims to counter the misuse of commercial spyware, which poses risks to national security and human rights. It follows a policy process initiated in late 2021 to assess the threat posed by commercial spyware and implement measures to counter its proliferation and misuse. The executive order establishes factors for evaluating the risk posed by commercial spyware, including its use by foreign governments, trustworthiness of vendors, and human rights abuses. The order also aims to spur industry reform and foster international cooperation. The executive order does not mandate the creation of a public list of banned spyware vendors. Additionally, the executive order is part of the second Summit for Democracy, which will address the misuse of technology and promote democratic values in the digital age. The summit will include discussions on advancing democracy and internet freedom, countering digital authoritarianism, and shaping emerging technologies.
