The United States is taking steps to ensure a reliable supply of the medical isotope molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) while minimizing the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU) for civilian purposes. Mo-99 is used in medical procedures, but its supply has encountered shortages and unreliability due to the limited number of facilities producing it. Most of these facilities use HEU targets, which is a concern due to its potential use in nuclear weapons or acts of terrorism. The United States is accelerating commercial projects to produce Mo-99 domestically without using HEU. They are also calling upon the industry to establish a unique product code for Mo-99 produced without HEU, preferentially procuring such products when available, and exploring health insurance payment options to promote a sustainable non-HEU supply. The United States will continue to encourage domestic production of Mo-99 without HEU and provide support to international producers in converting their facilities to use low enriched uranium (LEU) instead. These efforts aim to ensure a reliable supply of medical isotopes while minimizing the use of HEU in the civilian sector.
