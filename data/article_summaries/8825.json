The White House is seeking additional funds to extend the Affordable Connectivity Program, which provides free and discounted high-speed internet to eligible households, through December 2024. The program aims to lower costs and bridge the digital divide, ensuring that all Americans have access to affordable, reliable internet for work, education, healthcare, and other essential needs. The program has already helped over 21 million households save over $500 million per month on their internet bills. Elected officials, community advocates, public interest groups, industry associations, and internet service providers have expressed support for the program and the White House's funding request, emphasizing the importance of affordable internet access for all Americans.
