The White House has announced new actions to help Americans manage student debt. These actions include a new goal to enroll 2 million more borrowers in plans like Pay As You Earn (PAYE), the launch of StudentLoans.gov/Repay to help borrowers navigate repayment options, new standards for student loan servicing to strengthen consumer protections, a prototype student loan Payback Playbook to provide personalized repayment information, improved student loan counseling, a research partnership program to drive better student outcomes, and efforts to ensure fair treatment of borrowers in credit reporting for student loans. The White House is also highlighting commitments from organizations to educate and assist borrowers with their student debt. Additionally, federal commitments include sharing information about income-driven repayment options with AmeriCorps members and federal employees, streamlining systems to make financial aid resources more accessible, and protecting Social Security benefits for borrowers with disabilities. The White House has also outlined the progress made in making college more affordable and keeping student debt manageable, as well as accomplishments on the Student Aid Bill of Rights.
