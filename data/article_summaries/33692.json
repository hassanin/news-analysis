On March 6, 2003, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency and blocked the property of certain individuals in Zimbabwe, citing their actions and policies as a threat to the foreign policy of the United States. This was done through Executive Order 13288, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Additional steps were taken in 2005 and 2008 through Executive Orders 13391 and 13469 to expand the scope of the national emergency and block the property of more individuals undermining democratic processes in Zimbabwe. The President has now announced that the national emergency declared in 2003 will continue for another year, as the actions and policies of these individuals still pose a threat to the foreign policy of the United States. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
