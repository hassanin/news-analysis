President Barack Obama has transmitted a Protocol to the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia to the Senate for ratification. The Protocol, signed in May 2014, aims to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and strengthen relations between the United States and the states of Central Asia. The President believes that ratifying the Protocol is in the best interest of the United States and will contribute to the realization of the Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. The Department of State's Overview of the Protocol states that ratification would not require any changes in U.S. law, policy, or practice. President Obama recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol.
