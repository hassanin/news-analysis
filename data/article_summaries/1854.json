On May 21, 2022, the President signed two bills into law. The first is H.R. 7691, also known as the "Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022." This bill provides emergency funding to federal agencies to assist and respond to the situation in Ukraine. The second bill is H.R. 7791, the "Access to Baby Formula Act of 2022." This legislation allows for certain program requirements to be waived in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children in case of a supply chain disruption or emergency. The President expressed gratitude to various lawmakers for their bipartisan efforts in passing these bills.
