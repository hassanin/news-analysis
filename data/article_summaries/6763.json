The Child Tax Credit (CTC) has been increased under the American Rescue Plan, providing more financial support to working families. The credit has been raised from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child for children over six years old and from $2,000 to $3,600 for children under six years old. Additionally, the age limit has been raised from 16 to 17. Families of 60 million children have started receiving monthly payments, providing relief across the country. Lower-income families with 26 million children are now receiving the full credit for the first time. The number of eligible Black and Hispanic families has also doubled. Families who were not required to file a tax return in the past two years and did not sign up for stimulus payments need to enroll to receive the Child Tax Credit payments. The Biden-Harris Administration has launched a whole-of-government effort to drive awareness and sign-ups for the credit. The impact of the Child Tax Credit has been significant, with a decrease in food instability and improvements in housing and expense difficulties reported. The credit provides extra support to families raising children, with full credit available for working families earning up to $150,000 for couples or $112,500 for single parents. The credit is being distributed monthly, with up to $300 per month for children under six and up to $250 per month for children aged six to 17. Approximately 60 million children are already receiving the credit, with most families receiving it as an automatic direct deposit on the 15th of every month. Families who don't use direct deposit will receive their payment by mail. Almost any family with dependent children under 18 is eligible, and signing up for the Child Tax Credit does not affect other benefits. For more information, visit www.childtaxcredit.gov.
