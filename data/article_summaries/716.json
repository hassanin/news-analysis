President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has vetoed a resolution passed by the Senate that would disapprove of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) final rule regarding small business lending. The CFPB's rule aims to provide transparency in the $1.7 trillion small business financing market and improve access to capital for small businesses. President Biden argues that the resolution would hinder oversight of abusive lenders, make it harder for small businesses to access capital, and impede efforts to address gaps in capital access for minority- and women-owned businesses. He believes that the resolution prioritizes the interests of big banks and corporations over small business owners, and therefore, he has vetoed it.
