The article is a memorandum from the White House Office of the Press Secretary regarding the Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2017. The memorandum states that up to 110,000 refugees will be admitted to the United States in FY 2017 for humanitarian reasons or national interest. The admissions will be allocated among different regions, including Africa, East Asia, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Near East and South Asia, and an unallocated reserve. The unallocated reserve can be used in regions where additional admissions are needed. Unused admissions allocated to a specific region can be transferred to other regions if there is a greater need. The memorandum also designates certain persons in Cuba, Eurasia and the Baltics, Iraq, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other exceptional circumstances as eligible refugees for admission to the United States. The memorandum concludes by authorizing the publication of this determination in the Federal Register.
