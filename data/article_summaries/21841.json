The article discusses President Obama's initiatives to help veterans find jobs. The Returning Heroes and Wounded Warrior Tax Credits, two provisions in the American Jobs Act, are supported by leading veterans' organizations. The Returning Heroes Tax Credit offers firms that hire unemployed veterans a maximum credit of $5,600 per veteran, while the Wounded Warriors Tax Credit provides firms that hire veterans with service-connected disabilities a maximum credit of $9,600 per veteran. President Obama also announced three executive actions to assist veterans in finding jobs, including the launch of the Veteran Gold Card, which grants enhanced services to Post-9/11 veterans, the launch of My Next Move for Veterans, an online resource for veterans to explore civilian occupations, and the creation of the Veterans Job Bank, a tool to help veterans find job postings. These initiatives aim to lower veteran unemployment, improve resources for veterans to transition to civilian jobs, and provide them with new tools for job searching.
