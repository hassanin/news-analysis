The White House is deeply concerned about the violence occurring in Kyiv, Ukraine, and urges all sides to de-escalate the situation. They believe that the tension in Ukraine is a result of the government's failure to address the legitimate grievances of its people. The government has been accused of weakening Ukraine's democracy by criminalizing peaceful protests and limiting the rights of civil society and political opponents. The White House calls on the Ukrainian government to repeal recent anti-democratic legislation, withdraw riot police from downtown Kyiv, and engage in dialogue with the political opposition. They support the non-violent nature of the Maidan movement and are considering additional steps, including sanctions, in response to the use of violence.
