The White House has released a report to the President on the National Export Initiative (NEI), which aims to double U.S. exports in five years and create millions of new jobs. The report, developed by the Export Promotion Cabinet, outlines the progress of the NEI and provides a plan for achieving the President's goals. The report focuses on five areas: access to credit, trade advocacy and export promotion, removing barriers to selling U.S. goods abroad, enforcing trade rules, and pursuing policies to increase global economic growth. The plan includes expanding assistance to small and medium-sized businesses, launching a national outreach campaign, re-launching the government's export internet portal, bringing more international buyers to U.S. trade shows, increasing trade missions, improving commercial advocacy, and extending more export credit. The NEI represents the first government-wide export-promotion strategy with focused attention from the President and his cabinet. Since the NEI was announced, various government agencies have supported billions of dollars in exports and thousands of jobs. The report emphasizes the importance of exports to the U.S. economy and highlights the growth in exports in recent years. The NEI Report to the President is followed by the National Export Strategy, which will detail the implementation of the recommendations and measure progress.
