This article is a press release from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, dated July 11, 2012. It announces an executive order issued by President Barack Obama, titled "Blocking Property of Persons Threatening the Peace, Security, or Stability of Burma." The order modifies the scope of a national emergency declared in previous executive orders related to Burma (also known as Myanmar). It states that while the government of Burma has made progress towards political reform, there are still threats to peace, security, and stability, including the continued detention of political prisoners, efforts to undermine the reform process, and human rights abuses in ethnic areas. The executive order blocks the property and interests in property of individuals or entities that engage in these threatening actions. It also prohibits the making of contributions or provision of funds, goods, or services to or from any person whose property is blocked, and suspends the entry into the United States of aliens who meet the criteria outlined in the order. The order does not apply to official transactions of the United States government, and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to take necessary actions to implement the order.
