The article discusses the historic commitments made by the Obama Administration to build climate resilient communities in the United States. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the winners of the National Disaster Resilience Competition (NDRC), who will receive a combined $1 billion in disaster recovery funds. These funds will be used to rebuild and better prepare for future extreme weather and other climate change impacts. The winners include states and local communities that will invest in coastal protection, stormwater management, relocation assistance, economic development, and job creation through adaptation. 

In addition, the Administration is expanding the Resilience AmeriCorps and Climate Action Champions programs. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) will provide an additional $4 million over three years to expand the Resilience AmeriCorps program to the 27 finalists that did not receive funding through the NDRC competition. The Resilience AmeriCorps program recruits and trains AmeriCorps VISTA members to help develop preparedness plans and assist local leaders in addressing the impacts of extreme weather events. The Climate Action Champions program will also be available to the NDRC finalists, providing peer-to-peer support and technical assistance to further their resilience efforts.
