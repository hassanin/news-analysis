Loopholes in the US immigration system have made it difficult to remove criminal aliens, according to an article. While Congress included provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act that criminal aliens convicted of serious offenses should face immigration consequences, federal courts have created loopholes that prevent some convictions from qualifying as aggravated felonies. This means that the government often cannot use the only grounds available to remove many criminal aliens. For example, in California, a criminal alien convicted of voluntary manslaughter, robbery, or child abuse would not necessarily be considered an aggravated felon. Efforts to remove criminal aliens were further hindered by a recent Supreme Court decision that invalidated a provision defining which "crimes of violence" constitute aggravated felonies. The article argues that Congress needs to take action to close these loopholes in order to protect American communities.
