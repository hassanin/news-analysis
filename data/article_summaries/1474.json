President Biden will sign an Executive Order aimed at creating more resilient and secure supply chains for critical goods. The order comes in response to recent shortages of essential products, such as medicine, food, and computer chips, which have affected American households, workers, and companies. It also addresses the unacceptable shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and the automotive semiconductor chip shortages that have impacted car manufacturing plants. The goal is to ensure that the United States is not left vulnerable to production shortages, trade disruptions, natural disasters, or actions by foreign competitors and adversaries. The Executive Order includes a 100-day review to address vulnerabilities in the supply chains of four key products, as well as a one-year review of a broader set of U.S. supply chains. The Administration will also work with Congress and U.S. partners and allies to strengthen supply chains. Additionally, the order emphasizes the importance of creating well-paid jobs and ensuring that the benefits of securing supply chains reach all Americans, including communities of color and those affected by job losses and industrial decline. The aim is to not only protect against shortages of critical products but also maintain America's competitive edge, strengthen national security, and support economic growth, increased wages, small businesses, pandemic and biopreparedness, the fight against climate change, and America's technological leadership.
