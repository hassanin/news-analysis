Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger met virtually with the bipartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors to discuss cybersecurity challenges facing cities and towns, particularly the threat of ransomware. Neuberger outlined the Administration's ransomware strategy, which includes disrupting ransomware infrastructure, holding countries accountable for harboring ransom actors, expanding cryptocurrency analysis, and developing a consistent approach towards ransom payments. The meeting also focused on how mayors and the Administration can collaborate to prevent and respond to cyber threats, and how communities can strengthen their cyber defenses. Neuberger emphasized the Administration's commitment to supporting state and local governments with federal resources, including cybersecurity professionals. She also highlighted the measures the Biden Administration has taken to modernize cyber defenses, such as the recent Executive Order on cybersecurity and partnerships with the public and private sectors. Neuberger urged mayors to review their cybersecurity posture and continuity plans and emphasized the importance of public-private partnerships in combating ransomware. The threat of ransomware is a priority for national security and economic security, and the President will convene key leaders to discuss strategic efforts to counter it.
