President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Florida due to the effects of Tropical Storm Debby. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The declaration makes federal funding available to individuals in Baker, Bradford, Columbia, Pasco, and Wakulla Counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Damage surveys are ongoing in other areas, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling FEMA's toll-free numbers.
