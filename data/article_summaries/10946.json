First Lady Michelle Obama has a busy schedule ahead. On October 8, she will honor the 2015 class of the National Student Poets Program, which recognizes young poets for their creativity and promise. As the honorary chairman of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, the First Lady will celebrate the honorees and host a reading of their original work. The event will take place in Washington, DC.

Later that day, as part of the Joining Forces initiative, Mrs. Obama will attend the Veterans Initiative Summit in Washington, DC. The summit marks the beginning of a joint effort by several companies to promote the recruitment and retention of veterans and military spouses in their portfolio companies. The First Lady will participate in a roundtable discussion with CEOs and senior leaders, address hiring representatives, and introduce a panel of veterans and military spouses who have succeeded in the portfolio companies.

On October 10, Mrs. Obama will travel to Groton, Connecticut to participate in the christening of the PCU Illinois, the 13th ship of the Virginia class of submarines. As the ship's sponsor, she will deliver remarks and christen the ship. The First Lady had previously participated in the keel laying of the PCU Illinois in May 2014.
