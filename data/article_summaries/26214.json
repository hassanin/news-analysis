On July 24, 2020, President Donald Trump issued executive orders regarding healthcare, specifically focusing on the affordability of insulin and injectable epinephrine. The orders address the rising prices of these medications and aim to ensure that Americans without access to affordable options through insurance or federal programs can purchase them at a price similar to what Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) pay. FQHCs receive discounted prices through the 340B Prescription Drug Program, allowing them to purchase medications at a cost of one penny per unit. However, these discounts are not always passed on to low-income individuals at the point of sale. The executive orders direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take action to ensure that future grants available to FQHCs are conditioned upon their establishment of practices to make insulin and injectable epinephrine available at the discounted price for individuals with low incomes who have high cost sharing requirements, high deductibles, or no health insurance. The orders state that they do not impair existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits enforceable against the United States.
