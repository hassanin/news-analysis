President Donald J. Trump has authorized the deployment of the National Guard to support the Border Patrol in their mission to protect the country and stop illegal immigration. The National Guard will aid in securing the southern border until Congress takes action to close loopholes in border security efforts, including ending the practice of Catch and Release. This is not the first time the National Guard has been deployed to the southern border, as President Barack Obama and President George W. Bush also authorized deployments in the past. The President is taking action to protect national security due to the obstruction of congressional Democrats in securing the border. The President has called for greater resources, legal authorities, and the closure of loopholes to address the problem of illegal immigration. The current laws and resources are insufficient in stopping illegal border crossings and removing apprehended illegal immigrants. The President is using his existing powers to address these gaps caused by congressional inaction.
