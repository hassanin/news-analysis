They discuss the outcomes of the first NATO session at the Chicago summit, which focused on NATO defense capabilities.

They agreed to develop a NATO Forces 2020 concept, adopt a Deterrence and Defense Posture Review, and consider reciprocal reductions in non-strategic nuclear forces. They also decided to have an interim NATO ballistic missile defense capability, which will provide real protection for parts of NATO Europe against ballistic missile attacks. Other decisions included the acquisition of the Alliance Ground Surveillance system and the extension of the Baltic air policing mission. The leaders also supported the Smart Defense Initiative and reaffirmed NATO's nuclear posture. The press briefing did not discuss the situation in Syria, but emphasized that the focus is on political transition, support for the Syrian opposition, and coordinated sanctions against the Assad regime. The briefing also addressed the French troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, the issue of NATO expansion, and the specifics of the interim missile defense capability.
