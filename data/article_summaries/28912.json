President Trump signed the "Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act" into law, imposing new sanctions on Iran, North Korea, and Russia. He expressed his support for tough measures to punish these rogue regimes and to deter interference in America's democratic process. The President stated that he has already enacted tough sanctions on Iran and North Korea and strengthened existing sanctions on Russia. However, he also expressed concerns about the bill's encroachment on executive power, its negative impact on American companies, and its potential harm to European allies. Despite these flaws, the President signed the bill for the sake of national unity, as it represents the will of the American people to see Russia improve relations with the United States. The bill also sends a clear message to Iran and North Korea that their dangerous behavior will not be tolerated. The President emphasized his ability to make better deals with foreign countries as President than Congress.
