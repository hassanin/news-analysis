The White House has issued a statement regarding the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors' resolution on Syria. The statement highlights that the international community is taking action to uphold nonproliferation rules, as Syria has been found to have violated its nonproliferation obligations. The IAEA reports that Syria, with assistance from North Korea, attempted to build a secret nuclear reactor capable of producing nuclear weapons-usable plutonium. Syria has obstructed the IAEA's efforts to investigate the reactor by refusing access to associated sites, personnel, and documents. As a result, the IAEA Board has referred Syria to the UN Security Council for further deliberation. The United States is committed to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and will work with partners and allies to ensure that every country meets its responsibilities or faces accountability for its actions.
