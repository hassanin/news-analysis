The White House has announced its commitment to invest more than $1 billion to expand the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) in order to prevent, detect, and respond to future infectious disease outbreaks. This investment will focus on 17 countries, with more than half of the funds being directed towards African countries. The goal is to prevent or mitigate the impact of outbreaks, rapidly detect and transparently report outbreaks, and employ a global network that can respond effectively. The partner countries include Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote dâ€™Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Uganda, as well as Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Vietnam. The United States is also working with the African Union Commission to establish an African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and supporting the development of National Public Health Institutes in various African countries. The GHSA aims to enhance global capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, and it involves over 40 countries. The specific targets of the GHSA include countering antimicrobial resistance, preventing the spread of zoonotic diseases, improving immunization, establishing a national laboratory system, strengthening real-time biosurveillance, and enhancing medical countermeasures and personnel deployment. The United States has committed to assisting at least 30 countries to achieve these targets.
