The article discusses the need for reform in the United States Air Traffic Control (ATC) system. The current system is hindered by bureaucratic obstacles, which prevent the timely introduction of new technology and innovative operations. To modernize the ATC system, the administration proposes moving the operations into a new non-governmental entity. This will allow the ATC to keep up with the evolving aviation industry, including the integration of new entrants such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Commercial Space Transports. The reform aims to reduce aircraft delays, improve safety, protect access to rural communities, and encourage capital investment. The new ATC entity will be self-sustaining and financed through fees paid by users of the National Airspace System (NAS). The article also outlines principles for the reform, including maintaining safety oversight by the FAA, ensuring national security and law enforcement capabilities, prioritizing cybersecurity, maintaining open access for all users, and establishing a new independent organization to operate the airspace. The article concludes by discussing the composition of the board that will govern the new ATC entity.
