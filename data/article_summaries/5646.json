This proclamation, signed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., announces modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). These modifications are made in accordance with various trade agreements and laws, including the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement, the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement, and the Agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada.

The proclamation also terminates the designation of Ethiopia, Guinea, and Mali as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries for purposes of trade benefits under section 506A of the Trade Act. It provides modifications to the HTS to reflect this termination.

Additionally, the proclamation corrects technical errors in the HTS related to the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the United States-Israel Free Trade Area.

The modifications and technical corrections to the HTS will take effect on the dates specified in the proclamation.
