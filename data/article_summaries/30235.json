President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Route 66 Centennial Commission Act," which establishes a Commission responsible for conducting a study on ways to honor the centennial anniversary of Route 66 and providing recommendations exclusively to Congress. The Commission will be made up of individuals appointed by the President, based on recommendations from Members of Congress. The President's Administration considers the Commission to be located in the legislative branch to address concerns regarding the separation of powers. The General Services Administration (GSA) is expected to provide administrative support services to the Commission upon request and on a reimbursable basis. However, the President emphasizes that a directive from a legislative branch entity cannot bind an executive branch entity like the GSA.
