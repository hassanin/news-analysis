The article discusses the announcement made by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act stipulates that a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and transmits it to Congress, stating that the emergency is to continue beyond its anniversary date. President Biden has sent such a notice to the Federal Register, indicating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957, which was issued on March 15, 1995, will continue beyond March 15, 2022. The President cites the ongoing actions and policies of the Iranian government as an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Consequently, the comprehensive sanctions against Iran will remain in effect in response to this threat. The notice was sent on March 3, 2022, from the White House.
