The White House is hosting a virtual discussion with Indigenous women leaders from Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The purpose of this discussion is to gather their expertise and recommendations on priority areas for the Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls. The Trilateral Working Group was established in 2016 and aims to address issues of violence against Indigenous women and girls in the region. The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues recognized the importance of this initiative in 2019.
