Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Benjamin Rhodes met with Yezidi leaders at the White House to discuss the ongoing threat from ISIL and update them on coalition efforts to counter ISIL in Iraq. Rhodes condemned ISIL's attacks on the Yezidi community and other religious minorities in northern Iraq, as well as their bombings in Shi'a areas and massacres of Sunnis. He offered condolences for those who lost their lives in the violence and thanked the leaders for providing information on the humanitarian situation of Yezidi refugees. Rhodes noted that the coalition had conducted airstrikes against ISIL positions around Mount Sinjar and emphasized the group's inhumanity. He urged all Iraqis to work together to counter ISIL and discussed plans for the Iraqi Government to develop a National Guard. Rhodes reiterated the United States' commitment to the safety and security of the Yezidi community and pledged continued humanitarian assistance for those displaced inside Iraq, including Yezidi women and girls who have faced abuse from ISIL.
