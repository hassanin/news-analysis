Senior Advisor to the President David Axelrod and Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Diana Farrell will hold a media conference call to discuss the impact of the recently passed Wall Street reform bill on families and businesses across the country. The reform bill aims to protect consumers when they take out a mortgage or sign up for a credit card, prevent shadowy deals that led to the financial crisis, and ensure that taxpayers are not responsible for Wall Street's mistakes. The conference call will take place on July 16th at 12:00 p.m. EDT. Reporters can join the call by dialing (800) 553-0288 and asking to join the "White House Call."
