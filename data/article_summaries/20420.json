A new report released by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) attributes 2.2 to 2.8 million jobs to the Recovery Act, with half of those jobs resulting from over $200 billion in tax credits and financial assistance targeted primarily at low- and middle-income families. The report shows that last year, tax credits and wage assistance had a significant impact on people's real discretionary income and are contributing to the projected goal of generating or preserving 3.5 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also highlights the positive impact of the Recovery Act on families, stating that without the provisions, family income would have significantly decreased in 2009 and consumer spending would not have rebounded. The report was released during tax season, when taxpayers can claim various tax benefits provided by the Recovery Act, such as the First-Time Homebuyer Credit, American Opportunity Credit, Residential Energy Credits, and Making Work Pay tax credits. The White House has also launched a Tax Savings Tool to help taxpayers determine the benefits they are eligible for under the Recovery Act. Since the enactment of the Recovery Act, the economy has experienced significant growth in GDP and job creation. So far, $525 billion has been allocated to specific projects, with $370 billion already paid out.
