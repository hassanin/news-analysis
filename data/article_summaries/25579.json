The FY 2021 Budget proposed by President Trump focuses on accelerating United States research and development (R&D) to maintain global leadership in science and technology. The budget includes a significant increase in nondefense artificial intelligence (AI) R&D compared to the previous year, with the goal of doubling it by 2022. Additionally, the budget greatly increases funding for quantum information science (QIS) R&D, with an investment increase of over 50% across key agencies relative to the FY 2020 Budget, aiming to double QIS R&D by 2022.
