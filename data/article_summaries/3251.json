President Emmanuel Macron of France and President Joe Biden of the United States held a phone call on September 22 to discuss the implications of a recent announcement. They agreed that open consultations among allies would have been beneficial and committed to a process of in-depth consultations to build confidence and propose concrete measures. The two leaders will meet in Europe in October to further these discussions. President Macron has decided to send the French Ambassador back to Washington to work closely with US officials. President Biden reaffirmed the importance of French and European engagement in the Indo-Pacific region and expressed support for a stronger European defense. The United States also pledged to reinforce its support for counter-terrorism operations in the Sahel region conducted by European states.
