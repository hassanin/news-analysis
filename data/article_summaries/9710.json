President Obama has signed an executive order making the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program a permanent part of the Federal government. This program brings executives, entrepreneurs, technologists, and other innovators into government to improve programs that serve more than 150 million Americans. The program is built on four key principles: recruiting the best innovators, partnering with innovators inside government, deploying proven private sector strategies, and focusing on the nation's biggest challenges. The program will be administered by a Director and guided by an Advisory Board. Additionally, 6 new Presidential Innovation Fellows have been announced, bringing the total number of Fellows to 96 since the program's launch in 2012. The Fellows have worked on various projects, including improving access to education, fueling job creation, and expanding public access to personal health data. The program has had successful outcomes, such as opening over 130,000 data sets, launching the online GI Bill Comparison Tool for veterans, and creating the Veterans Employment Center. The program is now accepting applications for future Fellows.
