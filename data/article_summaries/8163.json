The Biden Administration is announcing additional actions to reduce gun crime and make communities safer. The plan includes steps to stop the flow of guns used in crimes, bolster law enforcement, invest in community-based programs that prevent violence, expand opportunity, lower recidivism, and increase funding for community policing. The administration is providing cities and states with historic levels of funding to put more police officers on the beat and invest in violence prevention programs. The Department of Justice has launched five gun trafficking strike forces and implemented a nationwide strategy to combat violent crime. The strategy focuses on strengthening law enforcement efforts, stemming the trafficking of illegal guns, and making investments in communities to prevent gun violence. The administration is also calling on Congress to act on a $300 million budget request to double the size of the Department of Justice's community policing grant program. The article highlights the administration's comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crime and provides examples of actions taken in the past year to implement the strategy, such as cracking down on firearms trafficking, supporting local law enforcement, investing in community violence interventions, expanding summer programming and employment opportunities for young adults, and helping formerly incarcerated individuals reenter their communities.
