This article discusses an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on December 14, 2020, regarding occupational regulations. The order aims to reduce the burden of occupational regulations in order to promote economic growth, lower consumer costs, and increase job opportunities. It states that occupational regulations can hinder job creation and economic mobility, particularly for low-income Americans and military spouses. The order outlines six principles that should guide occupational regulation reform, including active supervision of licensure boards, adopting least restrictive regulations, reviewing existing regulations, considering applicants with criminal records, and providing accommodations for military spouses. The order also requires agencies to review their regulations and submit reports on necessary changes to align with the principles set forth. Furthermore, it calls for the identification of opportunities to encourage occupational regulation reform and the implementation of recommendations to recognize and reward governments with reform policies in place. The order provides definitions for terms such as "occupational license" and "occupational regulation" and includes general provisions to ensure its implementation is consistent with applicable law.
