The Vice President, Kamala Harris, held a teleconference with a group of women leaders and national leaders to discuss the impact of the pandemic on women workers and the importance of passing the American Rescue Plan. Harris highlighted the job loss, small business closures, and childcare crisis as the main reasons why women have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. She emphasized that the longer action is delayed, the harder it will be to bring women back into the workforce. Harris outlined the key provisions of the American Rescue Plan, including direct relief payments, tax credits for parents, funding for schools and childcare, and vaccination efforts. She expressed gratitude for the members of Congress championing these provisions and stressed the importance of sharing stories and advocating for the bill to be signed into law. Senator Patty Murray, the chair of the Senate HELP Committee, was also present and engaged in the roundtable discussion.
