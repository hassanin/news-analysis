In this article, President Trump speaks about the state of the economy and the ongoing trade dispute with China. He claims that the US economy is the greatest in history and that China has been treating the US unfairly in trade for many years. He expresses confidence in reaching a deal with China but also states that the US is in a strong position and will not let China take advantage of them. He also discusses the employment numbers, which he claims are at record levels, and praises the performance of various demographic groups in the job market. Trump denies asking the Attorney General to launch a probe into the Russia investigation but expresses support for the investigation, calling it a "hoax." He also addresses questions about Chinese retaliation, his son being subpoenaed, troop deployments to the Middle East, and the impact of the trade war on American consumers.
