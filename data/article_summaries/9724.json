The White House is hosting the Tribal Youth Gathering, which aims to engage Native American youth in discussions on important issues such as cultural protection, education, health, climate change, tribal justice, and economic opportunity. This event is part of the Generation Indigenous (Gen-I) initiative, which focuses on improving the lives of Native youth and cultivating the next generation of Native leaders. The government has made various commitments to support Native youth, including investing in college and career readiness programs, improving school environments, providing grants for tribal education departments, and creating online resources for tribal communities. Additionally, there will be efforts to preserve and revitalize Native languages, promote energy-related competitions for high school students, and expand economic opportunities through job training and mentorship programs. The government will also support the development of Native youth leaders, improve services for victims of crime, and provide financial assistance for college and career readiness. Overall, these initiatives aim to create safer and more supportive Native communities, expand economic opportunities, and empower Native youth to become leaders in their communities.
