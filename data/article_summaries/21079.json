The White House Homeland Security Partnership Council was established in 2012 through Executive Order 13629. Its purpose is to maximize the Federal Government's ability to develop local partnerships in the United States to support homeland security priorities. The Council provides advice and information to the White House and Federal departments and agencies to help develop these partnerships. It is an advisory body and does not direct or coordinate Federal Government partnership activities. The Council draws upon field-based Federal employees from across the United States who are recognized for their expertise in building partnerships. It serves as a local network of Federal Government partnership specialists, capturing best practices and insights from local communities. The Council members constitute a national network of partnership experts who can exchange ideas, build upon their expertise, and create new innovative partnerships. At the national level, there is a White House-led Interagency Policy Committee responsible for developing national policy for homeland security partnerships.
