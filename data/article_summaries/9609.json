The United States welcomes Canada's decision to deploy fighter and refueling aircraft, as well as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, to participate in the campaign against ISIL in Iraq. Canada has also deployed troops to advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces and has provided humanitarian assistance. The US appreciates Canada's leadership and resolve in addressing security challenges. The two countries have a history of fighting alongside each other and the US is grateful for Canada's contribution against terrorism. The US will continue to work with international partners to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL through various means, including military actions, efforts to stop terrorist financing, countering foreign fighters, and delegitimizing ISIL's ideology.
