The White House held a press call to preview the visit of Colombian President Santos to Washington, D.C. The visit is meant to recognize the success of the Colombian Peace Process and to discuss future support for Colombia. During the visit, Vice President Biden will host a private breakfast with President Santos to discuss the peace process and future support. President Obama will meet with President Santos in the Oval Office to discuss the latest developments in the peace negotiations. The two presidents will also attend a reception commemorating the 15-year anniversary of Plan Colombia. Secretary Kerry will host a working lunch for President Santos and his delegation at the State Department to discuss the peace process and future U.S. assistance. The United States plans to request increased bilateral assistance to support Colombia's efforts to implement a peace accord. The assistance will focus on security, justice, and assistance for victims of the conflict. The two presidents are also expected to discuss other regional and global issues, such as the Zika virus and counternarcotics efforts. There was no mention of former Colombian Presidents Uribe and Pastrana attending the visit. The FARC, a terrorist organization, may be removed from the U.S. list of terrorist organizations if they disarm completely and separate themselves from illegal activities.
