In August 2011, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order to block property and prohibit certain transactions with respect to the Government of Syria. This action was taken in response to the Government of Syria's escalation of violence against its own people. The order was issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 (SAA). The President found that the actions of the Syrian government posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The order blocked the property and interests in property of the Government of Syria and imposed additional sanctions. It also prohibited new investment in Syria by US persons, the exportation of services to Syria, the importation of petroleum or petroleum products of Syrian origin into the US, and certain transactions related to petroleum or petroleum products of Syrian origin. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, was delegated the authority to take necessary actions to carry out the order. All US government agencies were directed to implement the provisions of the order.
