President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 27, 2014, as National Public Lands Day in the United States. This day is dedicated to the maintenance and restoration of the country's public lands and ecosystems. Americans of all ages are encouraged to volunteer and participate in various activities to preserve and protect these natural spaces. The proclamation highlights the importance of land stewardship and outdoor conservation, as well as the initiatives taken by the government to empower local communities in protecting their own public spaces. In honor of National Public Lands Day, national parks and federally managed lands will offer free admission. The proclamation emphasizes the commitment to making land stewardship a year-round effort and creating job opportunities in preserving and restoring the nation's lands and waters. The goal is to ensure that future generations can continue to enjoy the beauty of America's public and wild places.
