The United States President has signed an Executive Order to protect the integrity of the country's electoral system and prevent foreign interference in elections. The order requires the intelligence community and other federal agencies to assess the extent of any foreign meddling after every election. If any foreign interference is found, the order authorizes appropriate sanctions against individuals, foreign entities, or countries involved. The Executive Order also directs the development of a uniform process for assessing and determining foreign interference. While primary responsibility for managing elections lies with state and local authorities, the federal government plays a crucial role in identifying and deterring foreign interference and supporting election infrastructure. The President emphasizes that his administration has taken decisive action in foreign policy, and this Executive Order adds to the measures implemented to protect the electoral system. As the election season approaches, efforts are being made to ensure the security of the democratic process from foreign threats.
