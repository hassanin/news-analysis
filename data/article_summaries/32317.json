This presidential memorandum, issued by President Donald Trump on August 20, 2019, focuses on the launch of spacecraft containing space nuclear systems. The memorandum establishes processes for launches of space nuclear systems and emphasizes the importance of using these systems safely and sustainably to maintain U.S. dominance and leadership in space. It outlines safety guidelines that should be followed to ensure safe operation, including the probability of accidents resulting in exposure to the public. The memorandum also establishes a three-tiered launch authorization process based on the characteristics of the system, potential hazard levels, and national security considerations. It requires the preparation of a mission Safety Analysis Report (SAR) and the establishment of an Interagency Nuclear Safety Review Board (INSRB) to evaluate the safety analysis. The memorandum also includes reporting requirements and supersedes previous memoranda on space nuclear power.
