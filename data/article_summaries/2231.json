The United States, Japan, and South Korea have condemned the recent missile launches by North Korea. These launches are considered violations of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions and highlight the threat posed by North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. The countries emphasize the importance of fully implementing UN resolutions that aim to prevent North Korea from acquiring the technologies necessary for these launches. The United States also reaffirms its strong security commitments to Japan and South Korea. Officials from the three countries met in Tokyo to discuss ways to enhance trilateral cooperation in responding to the North Korean threat. They expressed their belief that diplomacy is the preferred path for North Korea and pledged to intensify their efforts to maintain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
