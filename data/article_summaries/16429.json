Governor Edward G. Rendell is praising President Obama's efforts to reach a tax-package compromise with Congress. The compromise will have an immediate impact on over 83,000 Pennsylvanians who were scheduled to lose their unemployment benefits. Governor Rendell highlights five important things that were achieved in the compromise: extending the earned income tax credit for the poorest Americans, extending the college credit, adding 13 more months of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans, adding a 2-percent payroll cut for working people making less than $100,000, and helping small businesses by allowing them to write off investments in their business. Governor Rendell acknowledges that while he dislikes giving a tax cut to the wealthy, the compromise was necessary and beneficial for working-class and middle-class Americans. He also dismisses the notion that raising taxes on the wealthy will hurt job creators, citing the example of President Clinton's tax increase in 1993 leading to the creation of 23.5 million new jobs.
