This article discusses the continuation of the national emergency declared by the President of the United States regarding the situation in Libya. The national emergency was initially declared on February 25, 2011, due to the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his government, which posed a threat to national security and foreign policy. It was expanded on April 19, 2016, to include ongoing violence, human rights abuses, and violations of UN resolutions in Libya. The President has decided to extend the national emergency for another year to protect against asset diversion and hindrances to Libyan national reconciliation.
