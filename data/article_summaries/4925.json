The Biden-Harris Administration has taken action to combat the monkeypox outbreak by increasing the number of available vaccine doses through an alternative dosing regimen. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the JYNNEOS vaccine to be administered intradermally, allowing for a smaller dose and increasing the number of available doses by up to five-fold. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued a determination that allows for the emergency use authorization of vaccines to prevent monkeypox and severe disease from the virus. The FDA has also authorized the use of the vaccine in individuals younger than 18 years who are at high risk of monkeypox infection. The administration will train healthcare workers and providers on how to administer the vaccine intradermally. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will provide guidance and support for the transition to intradermal administration. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to work on accelerating vaccine production and distribution to combat the monkeypox outbreak.
