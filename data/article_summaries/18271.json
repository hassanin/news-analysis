President Obama has signed the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009, which demonstrates the United States' commitment to ending the violence and destruction caused by the LRA in central Africa. The LRA is known for killing, raping, and mutilating civilians, as well as abducting and brutalizing children. The leadership of the LRA has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. The bill reaffirms U.S. policy to work towards resolving the conflict in northern Uganda and other affected areas in partnership with regional governments and multilateral efforts. The President commends the Government of Uganda for its efforts to stabilize the northern part of the country and supports other LRA-affected countries in their efforts to protect civilians. The United States has been working with others for over a decade to respond to the LRA crisis, including supporting peace processes, humanitarian assistance, protection of civilians, and regional recovery. The President congratulates Congress and the American people for their mobilization and advocacy on this issue and commits to working with them towards a future of peace and dignity for those affected by the LRA.
