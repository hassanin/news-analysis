The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced the addition of 13 counties in 12 states to its High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program. This designation will promote coordination among federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners in their efforts to disrupt and dismantle drug trafficking organizations. The newly designated counties will be joining existing HIDTA programs. The expansion of the HIDTA program is part of the Trump Administration's commitment to combating drug trafficking and keeping communities safe. In 2018, President Trump established the first new HIDTA program in 17 years in Alaska. The HIDTA Program initiatives in 2018 aimed to combat emerging drug threats.
