President Obama announced innovative measures to help families in the states most affected by the housing crisis. The average home prices in these states have decreased by over 20%. The new funding will help housing finance agencies in these areas better respond to the urgent problems faced by homeowners. The program aims to assist responsible homeowners in preserving their homes and stabilizing the housing market. The funding will be allocated based on the severity of the housing market decline and unemployment rates in each state. The program may include measures for unemployed homeowners, assistance for borrowers with underwater mortgages, and programs to address challenges from second mortgages. The initiatives will be transparent and accountable, with evaluations of their effectiveness published online. The funds will come from the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The Department of the Treasury will announce the maximum allocation for each state and the guidelines for the proposed programs in two weeks. The housing finance agencies will then have the opportunity to submit their proposals to receive funding. The program will address the specific needs of each state's housing market, focusing on unemployed borrowers, those with underwater mortgages, and homeowners with second mortgages.
