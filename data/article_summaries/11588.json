On November 9, 2011, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 368, called the "Removal Clarification Act of 2011," amends certain provisions of law related to removal from State courts to Federal District Courts in cases involving civil actions or criminal prosecutions against Federal officers or agencies. The second bill, H.R. 818, directs the Secretary of the Interior to allow for prepayment of repayment contracts between the United States and the Uintah Water Conservancy District in Utah. Lastly, S. 894, titled the "Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2011," provides a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for beneficiaries of veterans' disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation, which is equal to the Social Security COLA.
