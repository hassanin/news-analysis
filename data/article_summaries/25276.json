The Administration is strongly supportive of the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, also known as H.R. 3003. This bill aims to prevent American taxpayers from funding states and localities that obstruct federal law enforcement efforts. If a state or locality is found to be in violation of federal law, their eligibility to receive certain grants from the Department of Justice or Department of Homeland Security would be restricted, and the funds would be reallocated to compliant states and localities. Additionally, the bill seeks to enhance the detention of criminal aliens. The Administration believes that enforcing immigration laws is crucial for national security and public safety, and therefore considers this legislation to be essential. If H.R. 3003 is presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend signing it into law.
