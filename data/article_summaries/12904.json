President Obama has announced that ten states will receive flexibility from the mandates of the federal education law, No Child Left Behind (NCLB), in exchange for implementing reforms around standards and accountability. The ten states approved for flexibility are Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. The President argues that NCLB is driving the wrong behaviors and calls on Congress to fix the law. The administration is also working with New Mexico and 28 other states, along with D.C. and Puerto Rico, who have indicated their intent to seek waivers. To receive flexibility, states must adopt college and career-ready standards and create comprehensive systems of teacher and principal development. States receiving waivers no longer have to meet 2014 targets set by NCLB, but must set new performance targets and have accountability systems in place. They must also develop plans for improving educational outcomes for underperforming subgroups of students.
