President Barack Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum on December 29, 2009, directing an immediate review of aviation screening technology and procedures. The review was to be led by the Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with other departments and agencies such as the Department of Energy and the National Laboratories. The purpose of the review was to consider all aspects of aviation screening technology and procedures for both domestic and international air travel. It was important that the review did not interfere with the ongoing criminal investigation and prosecution of individuals involved in the attempted bombing of Northwest flight 253 on December 25, 2009. A preliminary report with recommendations for strengthening aviation screening technology and procedures, as well as an outline of the Department of Homeland Security's plan, was to be provided to the White House Staff Secretary by December 31, 2009. Further instructions would be given based on the contents of the report.
