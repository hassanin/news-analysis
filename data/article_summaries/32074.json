The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced a two-year grant worth $4 million for the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) to provide training and support to drug courts across the country. This grant aligns with President Trump's commitment to combat opioid abuse. Deputy Director Jim Carroll, along with Kellyanne Conway and U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, hosted a roundtable discussion at the White House with NADCP leadership, drug court judges, and drug court graduates. Drug courts are seen as an effective way to help individuals with substance use disorders involved in the criminal justice system. They provide treatment, support services, and accountability, helping participants rebuild their lives. Drug courts have been proven to be more effective than jail, probation, or treatment alone in reducing drug use and crime.
