President Donald Trump has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536 with respect to Somalia will continue beyond April 12, 2019. The United States is committed to Somalia's stabilization and maintaining sanctions against individuals who undermine its stability. The situation in Somalia is deemed to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, it has been determined that the national emergency declaration should continue.
