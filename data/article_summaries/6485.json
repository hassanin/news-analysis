The United States President Joseph R. Biden and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador have agreed to relaunch the U.S.-Mexico High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) to strengthen the strategic economic relationship between the two countries. The HLED, established in 2013, aims to promote economic development, job creation, global competitiveness, and poverty reduction. The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes the importance of the commercial relationship with Mexico, which is currently the largest trading partner in goods for the United States. The relaunched HLED will focus on four pillars: building back from the pandemic, promoting sustainable economic and social development in Southern Mexico and Central America, securing future prosperity tools, and investing in the workforce. The HLED will also involve input and engagement from stakeholders in civil society and business. The goal is to address priority issues and strengthen the partnership between the United States and Mexico to overcome challenges and foster thriving communities.
