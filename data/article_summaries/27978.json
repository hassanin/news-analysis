President Donald J. Trump has implemented a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports in order to counter global overcapacity and unfair trade practices in these industries. The purpose of these tariffs is to protect industries that are vital to national security. This action is consistent with President Trump's overall policies and practices.
