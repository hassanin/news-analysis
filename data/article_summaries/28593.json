President Trump has announced his strategy for dealing with Iran, including not certifying the Iran Nuclear Agreement Act (INARA). He outlined four objectives, which include countering Iran's destabilizing activities, placing additional sanctions on the regime, addressing the proliferation of missiles and weapons, and denying the regime any path to a nuclear weapon. While he did not call for withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, he did acknowledge its flaws and directed the Administration to work with Congress and allies to address them. The President emphasized the need to confront the Iranian regime and prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons.
