The Biden Administration has announced that it will facilitate the air shipment of approximately 2,500,000 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Nutricia/Danone Aptamil Gold Plus formula from New Zealand to Chicago on September 23. This delivery, part of Operation Fly Formula, will include about 167,000 pounds of formula and will primarily be distributed to retailers. The Food and Drug Administration has exercised enforcement discretion to allow Danone to export additional infant formula, including Neocate Infant DHA/ARA and Aptamil First Infant Milk Stage 1, into the U.S. market. Danone plans to export around 39 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of formula from Ireland and New Zealand. Operation Fly Formula, launched by President Biden, aims to expedite the import of infant formula and ensure its availability in stores, hospitals, and home health care providers. By September 23, the operation will have transported over 92 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S. The Biden Administration has also taken other measures, such as invoking the Defense Production Act and issuing FDA guidance, to ensure an adequate supply of safe infant formula for families.
