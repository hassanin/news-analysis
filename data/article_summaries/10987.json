The White House Press Secretary released a statement in response to the House passing a 90-day surface transportation extension. The statement emphasizes the importance of not jeopardizing American jobs and safety or hindering economic recovery by allowing funding to run out. However, the statement also highlights the need to move beyond short-term solutions and provide states and cities with certainty for planning and construction workers with job security. The Senate has already passed a bipartisan bill to address these issues, and the statement urges the House to do the same when they return to work.
