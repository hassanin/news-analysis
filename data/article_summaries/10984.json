President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Montana and authorized federal aid to support recovery efforts following a severe winter storm and straight-line winds that occurred in April 2016. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided on a cost-sharing basis to state, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Glacier, Liberty, Pondera, Teton, and Toole are specifically eligible for this assistance. Additionally, federal funding is available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Thomas J. McCool has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and further designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments and state requests.
