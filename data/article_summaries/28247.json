The article is a Presidential Memorandum issued on September 16, 2020, regarding the identification of major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries for Fiscal Year 2021. The memorandum identifies Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries. The memorandum emphasizes that a country's inclusion on the list does not necessarily reflect its counternarcotics efforts or cooperation with the United States. It highlights the harm caused by illicit drugs to the American people and national security. The memorandum discusses the efforts of the United States in countering transnational criminal organizations and specifically mentions the Venezuelan dictator, Nicolas Maduro, as the most complicit kingpin in the region. It calls on other governments in the Western Hemisphere, such as Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, to take greater responsibility in reducing illegal drug supplies. The memorandum also addresses Mexico's role as a major source of heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine seized in the United States, and urges Mexico to intensify its efforts in dismantling drug cartels and protecting the lives of its citizens. The memorandum designates Bolivia and the Maduro regime in Venezuela as having failed demonstrably to adhere to their international counternarcotics obligations, and emphasizes the importance of United States programs that support the legitimate interim government in Venezuela and the Bolivian government. The memorandum concludes by authorizing its submission to Congress and publication in the Federal Register.
