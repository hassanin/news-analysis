On December 5, 2022, the President signed four bills into law. The first is the "Metropolitan Areas Protection and Standardization Act of 2021" which ensures the independence and integrity of the Office of Management and Budget's core-based statistical area delineations. It also requires transparency in the uses of these delineations in domestic assistance programs. The second bill designates a Department of Veterans Affairs clinic in Florida as the Andrew K. Baker Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic. The third bill, called the "Disaster Resiliency Planning Act," requires Federal agencies to incorporate natural disaster resilience into real property asset management and investment decisions. The fourth bill extends the term of the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board through January 8, 2026.
