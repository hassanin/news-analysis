The White House Press Secretary released a statement in response to Speaker Boehner's speech on growing the economy and creating jobs. The statement emphasized that any plan to achieve these goals should benefit middle class families, bring back jobs for teachers, police officers, firefighters, and construction workers, and support small businesses. The President's plan, called the American Jobs Act, is said to meet these criteria. It includes proposals that have received bipartisan support in the past, is fully funded, and economists predict it could create between 1.5 and 2 million jobs. The plan also aims to rebuild the economy based on balance, fairness, and equal rules for everyone. The President is committed to working with both parties in Congress to pass the American Jobs Act without delay.
