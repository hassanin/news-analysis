In this statement, the President expresses frustration over the Senate's delay in confirming his nominees and the use of holds by senators for personal reasons. He warns that if Republican senators do not release these holds, he will use his authority to temporarily fill positions through recess appointments. The President acknowledges that some progress has been made with the release of holds, but emphasizes that there are still many deserving nominees awaiting confirmation. He concludes by stating that if the Senate does not act upon their return from recess, he will consider using recess appointments in the future.
