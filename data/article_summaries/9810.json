The White House has announced new commitments to the Equal Pay Pledge, with 44 companies signing on. These companies, including AT&T, eBay, and Yahoo, join over 100 other companies and organizations that are working to reduce the national gender pay gap. The pledge requires companies to conduct annual gender pay analyses, review hiring and promotion processes, reduce unconscious bias, and embed equal pay efforts into broader equity initiatives. The gender pay gap remains a persistent problem, with women earning only 80% of what men earn. African American and Latina women face even greater disparities, earning 63 cents and 54 cents, respectively, for every dollar earned by a white non-Hispanic man. The White House is urging the business community to continue implementing and upholding pay equity policies.
