The United States strongly condemns North Korea's test of a long-range ballistic missile, calling it a brazen violation of UN Security Council resolutions. The President's national security team is assessing the situation in coordination with allies. The test raises tensions and risks destabilizing the region's security. North Korea's actions prioritize its weapons programs over the well-being of its people. The US urges all countries to condemn these violations and calls on North Korea to engage in serious negotiations. Diplomacy is still an option, but North Korea must stop its destabilizing actions. The US will ensure the security of its homeland and allies in South Korea and Japan.
