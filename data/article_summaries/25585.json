President Donald J. Trump has signed the "Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victims Assistance Act of 2018" into law. This legislation aims to help victims of child sexual exploitation by ensuring they receive restitution for the harm they have suffered. It also establishes a minimum amount of restitution in each case and provides victims with different forms of restitution to choose from. The Trump Administration is committed to fighting against child pornography and sexual abuse through initiatives like Project Safe Childhood, as the number of children identified in child pornography material has nearly doubled in recent years. The President believes that protecting children from sexual exploitation and abuse is crucial to making America safe again.
