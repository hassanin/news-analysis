In a speech at the South Court Auditorium in the White House, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff expressed gratitude to President Biden and Vice President Harris for their actions against antisemitism, bigotry, and hate. He highlighted the alarming rise in antisemitic hate crimes in the United States, with Jews accounting for 63 percent of all religiously motivated hate crimes. Emhoff emphasized that antisemitism not only divides society but also threatens democracy and undermines American values. As the first Jewish spouse of a President or Vice President, he vowed to speak out against antisemitism and take action. Emhoff mentioned that President Biden established an all-of-government group to combat hate and develop a national strategy to counter antisemitism. He also discussed his personal connection to the issue, with his great grandparents having escaped persecution in Poland. Emhoff mentioned hosting conversations with various groups and convening special envoys from European countries at the White House. He then announced the release of the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, which is part of the administration's broader agenda to fight hate, strengthen democracy, and protect religious freedom. Emhoff emphasized the importance of a whole-of-society approach, involving federal agencies, Congress, state and local governments, civil society, schools, the private sector, and religious communities. He concluded by calling for united efforts to combat antisemitism and ensure that everyone can live openly and safely in their communities.
