The article discusses the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI), a program launched by President Obama in 2010. YALI aims to support young African leaders in their efforts to promote growth, strengthen governance, and enhance peace and security in Africa. With one in three Africans between the ages of 10 and 24, investing in the next generation of African leaders is crucial. Through YALI, the United States is providing resources to enhance leadership skills, support entrepreneurship, and connect young African leaders with each other and with the American people. The initiative has held various events, forums, and programs to engage young African leaders and provide them with opportunities to network, gain skills, and contribute to their communities. The U.S. government has also partnered with organizations like the African Union, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, and The Tony Elumelu Foundation to support the development of young African leaders. The State Department and USAID have invested in educational and cultural exchange programs, entrepreneurship initiatives, and partnerships with African universities to train the next generation of African leaders. USAID will establish regional hubs to expand leadership and training opportunities and leverage existing youth programs and initiatives. Other departments and agencies, such as the Department of Labor and the U.S. African Development Foundation, are also investing in initiatives to promote safe youth employment, provide training, and support small business start-ups. The article introduces the Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders, a program that will bring 500 young leaders to U.S. universities and colleges each year for academic and leadership training, with the goal of increasing to 1000 participants per year within five years. Fellows will receive training in business and entrepreneurship, civic leadership, and public administration, and will have access to opportunities such as internships, grants, and mentorship. The program aims to develop a network of young African leaders across various sectors to contribute to Africa's growth and development.
