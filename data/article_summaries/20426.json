Billy Frank, Jr., Chairman of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission and a member of the Nisqually Indian Tribe, has passed away. He fought for treaty rights to fish the waters of the Pacific Northwest and was arrested multiple times during tribal "fish-ins." In 1974, he finally won the battle for these rights. His efforts have led to better protection of resources and more tribes being able to enjoy the rights preserved for them over a century ago. Billy was passionate about ensuring future generations could enjoy the outdoors and was an inspiration on the issue of climate change. The President extends his condolences to the Nisqually Indian Tribe, Billy's family, and his many friends.
