The United States and Israel have reached a new 10-year security assistance Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), demonstrating President Obama's commitment to Israel's security. The MOU includes a total value of $38 billion ($3.8 billion per year), which is an increase from the current MOU of $30 billion. The funding will be disbursed in equal increments of $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and $500 million in missile defense funding each year. This increase in funding will allow Israel to update its fighter aircraft fleet, increase its missile defense capabilities, and acquire other defense capabilities. The MOU also discontinues two anomalies in the defense relationship, allowing Israel to spend more funding on advanced military capabilities. Israel has received a record amount of FMF funds under President Obama, totaling over $23.5 billion from 2009-2016. In addition to FMF funding, the United States has provided over $3 billion in missile defense funding for programs and systems for Israel, including the Iron Dome system. The United States has also provided other forms of support to Israel, such as research pilot programs and assistance in chemical-biological defense.
