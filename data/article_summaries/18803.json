The United States welcomes Australia's decision to deploy fighter aircraft and Special Forces to participate in airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq. This demonstrates Australia's commitment to addressing security challenges and supporting the international community. Denmark's authorization to contribute F-16 fighters and trainers to counter ISIL positions in Iraq is also welcomed, as is Turkey's recognition of ISIL as a threat and its authorization for military action against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. The United States will continue to work with international partners to defeat ISIL through various means, including military actions, cutting off terrorist financing, and countering the flow of foreign fighters.
