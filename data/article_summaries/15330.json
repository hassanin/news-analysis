President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism will continue beyond September 23, 2014. This emergency was declared in Executive Order 13224 on September 23, 2001, in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The President believes that the grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by foreign terrorists, as well as the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks, still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to continue this national emergency.
