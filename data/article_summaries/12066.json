President Obama will propose the Small Business Jobs and Wages Tax Cut, a new initiative aimed at creating jobs and cutting taxes for small businesses. Under this proposal, businesses will receive a $5,000 tax credit for every new employee hired in 2010, with a cap of $500,000 per firm to ensure the majority of the benefit goes to small businesses. Start-ups will be eligible for half of the tax credit. Additionally, small businesses that increase wages or hours for existing employees will be reimbursed for the Social Security payroll taxes they pay on real increases in their payrolls. The credit can be claimed on a quarterly basis, providing businesses with quick access to funds and an early incentive to hire and increase payrolls.
