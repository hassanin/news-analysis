The article discusses how companies sneak hidden fees into families' bills, resulting in hundreds of dollars being taken out of their pockets each month. These fees make it difficult for hardworking families to make ends meet. The article emphasizes that while the wealthy may not be affected, these hidden fees are a significant burden for average families. The administration proposes a rule to end excessive overdraft fees charged by some banks, which often hit the most vulnerable Americans the hardest. The proposal aims to cut the average overdraft fee by more than half, saving the typical American family $150 per year and totaling $3.5 billion in savings annually for families. The article mentions that some Republicans in Congress defend these exploitative fees. The administration is committed to lowering costs for hardworking families and growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up, while opposing Republican efforts to benefit the wealthy and big corporations at the expense of competition.
