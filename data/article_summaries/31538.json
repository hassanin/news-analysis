The article is a proclamation issued by President Donald J. Trump on May 29, 2020. The proclamation discusses the threat posed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the United States' technologies and intellectual property. It highlights the PRC's efforts to acquire sensitive US technologies to enhance its military capabilities. The proclamation specifically focuses on the use of Chinese students and researchers, particularly those associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA), as non-traditional collectors of intellectual property. As a result, certain nationals of the PRC seeking to enter the United States on F or J visas for study or research purposes are suspended and limited, unless they are pursuing undergraduate studies or fall under certain exceptions. The proclamation also mentions additional measures to mitigate the risk posed by the PRC's acquisition of sensitive US technologies and intellectual property. The proclamation is effective from June 1, 2020, and will remain in effect until terminated by the President.
