President Trump has signed an executive order launching the White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing. The council, chaired by Secretary Ben Carson, aims to address the overregulation of housing and housing markets, which is said to contribute to the rising cost of housing in the US. The President emphasized the need to reduce unnecessary regulations, stating that regulations can account for more than 25% of the cost of a new home. The supply of affordable housing is struggling to keep up with demand, with over 37 million American households spending more than 30% of their income on housing. The President also discussed the positive economic outlook and the progress being made in areas such as criminal justice reform and border security.
