President Obama has named seven eminent researchers as recipients of the National Medal of Science and five inventors as recipients of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. The National Medal of Science recognizes individuals who have made outstanding contributions to science and engineering, while the National Medal of Technology and Innovation recognizes those who have made lasting contributions to America's competitiveness and quality of life. The recipients will receive their awards at a White House ceremony later this year. Some of the recipients include Jacqueline K. Barton for her discovery of a new property of the DNA helix, Ralph L. Brinster for his contributions to the development and use of transgenic mice, and Rakesh Agrawal for his innovations in improving energy efficiency and reducing the cost of gas liquefaction and separation.
