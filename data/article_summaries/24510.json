In this presidential memorandum, President Barack Obama announces the continuation of certain authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act with respect to Cuba. These authorities were set to terminate on September 14, 2012, but the President determines that their continuation for one year is in the national interest of the United States. The exercise of these authorities will be continued until September 14, 2013, as implemented by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
