President Biden has called for all-of-government action to promote voting access and ensure that all eligible Americans can freely participate in the electoral process. In response, more than a dozen federal agencies have announced steps they are taking to increase access to voter registration services and information about voting. The President signed an Executive Order on March 7, the 56th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, to leverage federal resources in support of this goal. The Executive Order called for each agency to submit a strategic plan outlining how they can promote nonpartisan voter registration and participation. These plans are just the beginning, and agencies will continue to work on expanding their capacity to provide relevant information and facilitate participation in the electoral process. The President has also been engaging with various groups and appointing civil rights leadership to protect the right to vote. While the President calls on Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, he recognizes the need for immediate action.
