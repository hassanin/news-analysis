President Trump visited Fort Drum in New York to sign the National Defense Authorization Act, which he called the most significant investment in the military and warfighters in modern history. The bill authorizes $716 billion for the military, including funding for new equipment and technology. Trump praised the soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division and highlighted the importance of a strong military in maintaining peace and security. He also mentioned the administration's commitment to developing artificial intelligence capabilities and creating a new branch of the military called the United States Space Force to ensure American dominance in space.
