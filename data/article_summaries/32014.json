President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring October 15 through October 21, 2017, as National Character Counts Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of cultivating strong character in all citizens, particularly young people. It highlights the grit, integrity, determination, resolve, and honor that define the soul of the nation. President Reagan's belief in the vital role of the American family in shaping personal character is also mentioned. The proclamation encourages parents, educators, civic leaders, and church leaders to work together to cultivate strength of character in the youth. The proclamation recognizes that character is built slowly through everyday acts such as raising and providing for a family, working hard to obtain an education, and giving back to communities. It emphasizes that character is forged in various settings including kitchen tables, civic organizations, and houses of worship. The proclamation also expresses gratitude towards individuals who have inspired others through their strength of character and provided support during times of need. It calls upon public officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe National Character Counts Week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
