President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed the week of August 6 through August 12, 2023, as National Health Center Week in recognition of the vital role community health centers play in providing accessible and affordable medical, dental, and behavioral health care to over 30 million Americans. These federally funded health centers are spread across every state and territory, helping to ensure that health care is a right and not a privilege. The Biden Administration has made historic investments in strengthening the community health center network, including through the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The President's latest Budget aims to renew critical support for the Health Center Program, with a goal of doubling its size and expanding its reach. Community health centers are instrumental in addressing health care disparities in underserved communities, improving access to screenings, behavioral health services, and pregnancy-related care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these centers played a crucial role in vaccine distribution, particularly to people of color and those in rural areas. By having patient-majority governing boards, health centers ensure that decision-making is informed by the people they serve. The investments in community health centers are seen as a matter of human dignity and fairness, as improving care in every community benefits everyone. President Biden expresses gratitude to the dedicated staff of health centers for their heroic work in improving lives, especially during the pandemic. The Administration is committed to supporting these centers in making the nation healthier, more resilient, and more just.
