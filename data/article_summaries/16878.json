The article is a statement by the President on the announcement of additional sanctions on Iran. The President states that Iran has failed to abide by its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has violated UN Security Council resolutions and commitments to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The world has spoken out against Iran's actions, and today the administration is taking action to impose additional costs on Iran. The new sanctions target Iran's petrochemical sector and expand energy sanctions on its oil and gas sector. Additionally, 11 individuals and entities are designated for their role in assisting Iran's prohibited nuclear programs. The administration is also identifying the entire Iranian banking sector as a threat, along with the Central Bank of Iran. The United Kingdom and Canada have also taken action to cut off Iran from their financial systems. The President's priority is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and he has offered Iran the choice to fulfill its international obligations or face more pressure and isolation. As long as Iran continues down this path, the United States will continue to find ways to isolate and increase pressure on the Iranian regime.
