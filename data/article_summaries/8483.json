The Biden-Harris Administration is focused on expanding access to homeownership and ensuring homeowners can afford to stay in their homes and make necessary repairs. They have released new data showing significant federal investment in homeownership and have announced new actions to accelerate progress. However, they emphasize that Congress needs to take action to ensure homeownership is accessible to all households. President Biden has proposed a $16 billion Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit and a $10 billion down payment assistance program to help more families buy homes and build wealth. The Treasury Department has released data showing over $12 billion in support for homeowners through the American Rescue Plan's Homeowner Assistance Fund and the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds program. Federal agencies are also providing record support for low-income, middle-income, and first-time homebuyers. The Administration is committed to increasing homeownership opportunities and has implemented various policies to make it easier for individuals to qualify for mortgage financing. They are also working to ensure equity in the home appraisal process. However, they call on Congress to pass President Biden's proposals to make homeownership a possibility for all Americans.
