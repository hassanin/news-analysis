The Biden Administration is taking action to improve the health of rural communities by allocating billions of dollars in funding from the American Rescue Plan. The funding will address immediate COVID-19 needs, support rural hospitals to stay open in the long term, and enhance the care provided to rural communities. These actions are part of President Biden's Build Back Better agenda, which aims to make crucial investments in rural Americans' health by lowering healthcare costs, expanding access to care, and improving maternal health. Additionally, the bipartisan infrastructure legislation will improve the quality of drinking water in rural communities. The specific actions being taken include providing financial support to healthcare providers in rural areas, expanding access to COVID-19 vaccines, testing, and supplies, training new rural healthcare providers, enhancing access to pulmonary rehabilitation services, and expanding Veterans Affairs training programs for rural providers. The administration is also focused on increasing access to telehealth services and improving rural Americans' access to affordable healthcare through the Build Back Better agenda, which includes lowering prescription drug costs and keeping more rural hospitals open. Previous actions taken by the administration include supporting rural communities in fighting COVID-19, expanding access to quality healthcare, keeping rural hospitals open, expanding the pipeline of rural healthcare workers, addressing substance use disorders and the opioid epidemic in rural communities, prioritizing maternal health in rural America, and prioritizing access to clean drinking water.
