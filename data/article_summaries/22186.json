This article discusses an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2013 called the HIV Care Continuum Initiative. The order aims to strengthen the response to the domestic HIV epidemic in the United States. It highlights the importance of early HIV diagnosis, advances in HIV testing technology, and the benefits of early treatment. The order also emphasizes the role of the Affordable Care Act in expanding access to affordable healthcare and preventive services, including HIV testing. Despite progress, there are significant gaps in the HIV care continuum, and the order calls for increased efforts to address these gaps. The order establishes the HIV Care Continuum Initiative, overseen by the Director of the Office of National AIDS Policy, to mobilize and coordinate federal efforts in preventing and treating HIV infection. It also establishes the HIV Care Continuum Working Group to support the initiative and improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum. The working group consists of representatives from various federal agencies and offices. The working group will review efforts to improve testing, care, and treatment outcomes, conduct research, obtain input from stakeholders, identify impediments and opportunities, recommend strategies, and coordinate federal efforts. The working group is required to provide recommendations to the President within 180 days and submit an annual report on progress. The executive order does not affect existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits.
