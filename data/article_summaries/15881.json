President Obama announced the first steps towards implementing a new U.S. export control system. The Administration released a series of regulations and requests for comment, including a draft rule setting out the criteria and procedures to determine if a product is subject to export controls, and a draft rule specifying licensing policies for products subject to export controls. The goal of the export control reform initiative is to update the current system, designed for the Cold War era, to address current threats and the changing economic and technological landscape. The reform includes rebuilding the two U.S. export control lists, developing new criteria for determining what items need to be controlled, and assigning licensing policies based on the sensitivity of the items. The Department of State and the Department of Commerce published proposed regulations and requests for public comment. The Administration also debuted its Export Control Reform Initiative webpage, which features a consolidated electronic screening list to enhance exporter compliance. These steps aim to provide clarity and ensure the effectiveness of the export control system in protecting national security.
