The White House Press Secretary released a statement expressing the President's support for congressional action to provide an assistance package for Ukraine. The legislation includes loan guarantees to help Ukraine access necessary financing for economic stability and growth. The Administration also supports the authority to impose targeted sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for violence or undermining Ukraine's peace and sovereignty. The President will work with international partners to support Ukraine, and urges Republicans in Congress to support IMF reforms to provide necessary resources for Ukraine and other countries.
