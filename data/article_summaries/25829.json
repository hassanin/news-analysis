President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Michigan and has ordered Federal assistance to aid in recovery efforts after severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides occurred from June 16 to June 18, 2018. The Federal funding will be available to State, Tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive Federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. David G. Samaniego has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
