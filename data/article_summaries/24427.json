The article discusses the agreement between the United States and the European Union on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP). The European Parliament has approved a revised agreement that allows for the processing and transfer of financial messaging data for the TFTP. The agreement will enter into force on August 1, 2010, and will restore this important counterterrorism tool that has been suspended since January 2010. The TFTP has provided critical investigative leads since its creation after the September 11, 2001 attacks, aiding in the prevention and investigation of various terrorist attacks around the world. The new agreement includes additional data privacy safeguards while maintaining the effectiveness and integrity of the program. The Obama Administration prioritizes protecting privacy and civil liberties while using legitimate tools to combat terrorism. The United States values the partnership with the European Union and sees this agreement as a way to prevent terrorism while respecting the rule of law.
