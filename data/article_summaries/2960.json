Today marks the anniversary of the abduction of Robert Levinson in Iran, making him the longest held hostage in U.S history. Despite 14 years of efforts to locate Levinson and secure Iran's cooperation, there are still no answers. The United States will continue to demand answers and hold Iran accountable for his abduction, detention, and likely death. The priority is to ensure the return of all U.S citizens wrongfully detained in Iran and elsewhere. The past 14 years have been extremely difficult for Levinson's family, and while nothing can bring back the lost years, the United States remains committed to supporting the Levinson family and seeking justice for them.
