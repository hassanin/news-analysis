President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order prohibiting the importation of jadeite and rubies from Burma. This order is in response to the national emergency declared in 1997 due to the large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma. The order revokes a previous prohibition on the importation of articles that are products of Burma and waives certain sanctions described in the JADE Act. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to enforce the order. All agencies of the United States Government are directed to comply with the provisions of the order.
