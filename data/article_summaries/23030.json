President Obama has called for new measures to prepare American children for success in college and careers. This includes a redesigned Elementary and Secondary Education Act that focuses on improving teacher preparation and development, upgrading classroom instruction, and supporting high-quality assessments. The Obama Administration has applauded governors for their bipartisan work in developing higher standards in education. The President is urging states to adopt and certify college- and career-ready standards in reading and mathematics in order to qualify for federal funding. There will also be a focus on aligning teacher preparation practices and programs with these standards, implementing assessments aligned with the standards, and providing professional development for teachers and school instructional staff. The Race to the Top program will also be expanded to reward states and school districts that have these standards in place.
