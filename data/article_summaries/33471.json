President Donald Trump has signed the "Coordinated Ocean Observations and Research Act of 2020" into law. This act amends a section of the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act of 2009, requiring the Interagency Ocean Observation Committee to develop and transmit a coordinated budget to Congress and the President annually. However, President Trump argues that this requirement to recommend legislative measures goes against the Recommendations Clause of the United States Constitution, which gives the President the prerogative to recommend only necessary and expedient measures to Congress. The Trump administration will implement this provision in a manner consistent with the Recommendations Clause.
