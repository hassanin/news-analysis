The House and Senate have passed the American Rescue Plan, and President Biden plans to sign it into law this week. The Treasury and IRS are working to ensure that payments can be distributed starting this month. They are also using lessons learned from previous rounds of payments to increase the number of households receiving electronic payments, which are faster than checks. The direct payments in the American Rescue Plan will provide financial assistance to families. For example, a typical family of four with parents earning a combined income of $75,000 per year and children aged 8 and 5 will receive an additional $8,200. This money aims to help families during these challenging times, along with other provisions in the bill such as funding for school reopenings, vaccination efforts, and support for those who have lost their jobs.
