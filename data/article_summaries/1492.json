President Biden expressed his support for the agreement reached by Senators Schumer and Manchin on a bill to fight inflation and lower costs for American families. The bill aims to make prescription drugs cheaper by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prices and lower health insurance costs for families covered under the Affordable Care Act. It also includes provisions for improving energy security, tackling the climate crisis, and creating jobs in the energy sector. The bill will further reduce the deficit and will be funded by requiring big corporations to pay their fair share of taxes, with no tax increases for families making under $400,000 a year. President Biden urged the Senate and the House to move quickly on this legislation.
