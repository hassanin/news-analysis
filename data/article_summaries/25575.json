She also mentioned that the President will be making additional stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Vatican before attending the G7 Summit in Italy. On the healthcare vote, Sanders emphasized the need to repeal and replace Obamacare, stating that the current system is collapsing. She also expressed confidence in the passage of the American Health Care Act in the House.

She also discussed the President's engagement in selling the healthcare bill and his efforts to strengthen relationships with allies during his foreign trip. Additionally, Sanders addressed questions about the executive order's impact on the separation of church and state, potential legal challenges, and the President's meeting with the Pope.
