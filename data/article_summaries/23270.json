On June 25, 2009, the White House held a meeting with members of Congress to discuss immigration reform. The meeting aimed to facilitate an honest discussion about the issues surrounding immigration reform and identify areas of agreement and areas that still needed work. Attendees included administration officials such as Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, as well as members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, such as Senator John McCain and Representative Zoe Lofgren. The meeting was intended to kickstart a policy conversation and lay the groundwork for future debates on immigration reform.
