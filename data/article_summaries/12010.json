The United States is deeply concerned about the recent arrests of journalists in Ethiopia. While the country has made progress in protecting free expression, the continued stifling of independent voices will hinder democratic progress, development, and economic growth. The US urges the Ethiopian government to release journalists and others imprisoned for exercising their right to free expression, to stop using the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation to silence dissent, and to protect the rights of journalists, bloggers, and dissidents to write and speak freely.
