President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Rhode Island in response to the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The counties of Bristol, Newport, and Washington are eligible for this assistance. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional assistance may be designated after further assessments are completed.
