The Vice President spoke at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing the importance of reproductive rights and the challenges faced since the Supreme Court's decision last year. She criticized laws that criminalize healthcare providers and restrict access to reproductive healthcare. The Vice President emphasized that the government should not dictate what individuals do with their bodies and that decisions about reproductive health should be made in consultation with trusted advisors. She also highlighted the broader implications of attacks on reproductive rights, including the erosion of basic healthcare and other rights like LGBTQ rights and voting rights. The Vice President expressed concern over a court case in Texas that challenges an FDA-approved medication, mifepristone, and emphasized the potential consequences if politicians can undermine doctors' decisions through the court system. She concluded by reaffirming the administration's commitment to protecting public health and taking necessary action if the court ruling goes against their beliefs.
