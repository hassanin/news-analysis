President Trump's new measures on Cuba are aimed at pressuring Havana to reform itself. While maintaining relations with Cuba, Trump will not restore the wet foot, dry-foot policy that was rescinded by Obama. Trump will also continue to authorize Cuban Americans to travel to the island. The new measures include prohibiting transactions with the Business Administration Group, S.A (GAESA), which controls 60 percent of the Cuban economy. This ban is expected to financially impact the regime and send a political message. Cuban dissidents have expressed support for the changes, as they believe pressure needs to be applied to the Ra√∫l Castro regime. Overall, the article argues that Trump is right to recalibrate the policy on Cuba without completely abandoning it.
