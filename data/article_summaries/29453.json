In this op-ed, Sonny Perdue, the Secretary of Agriculture, discusses the Trump administration's approach to trade relations with China. Perdue highlights the issue of intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices by China, citing an incident in which Chinese nationals dug up genetically engineered seeds from an Iowa corn field. He emphasizes that President Trump is standing up to China and implementing tariffs, investment restrictions, and export controls to pressure China to stop engaging in unfair practices and open up its markets to American products. Perdue acknowledges that the disruption in trade relations is unsettling for many farmers, but assures them that the administration is working on a strategy to support them in the face of retaliatory tariffs. He also warns about the consequences of allowing China to capture industries critical to America's economic future and national security. Perdue concludes by expressing confidence in President Trump's negotiation skills and the strength and resolve of American farmers.
