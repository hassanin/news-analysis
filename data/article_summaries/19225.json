In a statement on Sunshine Week, the President commends efforts to increase transparency in government and pledges to make his administration the most open and transparent ever. The White House has already taken steps to achieve this, such as making visitor records available online, providing access to more government information on platforms like Data.gov and USAspending.gov, and implementing an Executive Order to combat unnecessary secrecy. The President acknowledges these achievements but emphasizes that there is still more work to be done to ensure transparency, participation, and accountability throughout the entire Administration.
