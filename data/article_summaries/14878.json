The White House Press Secretary released a statement urging Congress to raise the debt limit in order to avoid defaulting on bills. The statement expressed disappointment that a clean debt limit increase proposed by Senate Democrats was not given a vote. This bill would have eliminated the threat of default and provided certainty for businesses and the economy. With only five days until the government runs out of borrowing authority, the statement emphasized the need for Congress to find a solution that reopens the government, allows for bill payment, and enables progress towards a broader budget deal that promotes job creation, economic growth, and the strengthening of the middle class.
