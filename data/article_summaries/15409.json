The White House is pleased with the D.C. Circuit Court's ruling dismissing Sheriff Arpaio's lawsuit against the deferred action programs. The court recognized that the Constitution does not allow federal courts to hear baseless speculation lawsuits. The district court also acknowledged that the deferred action programs are a valid exercise of prosecutorial discretion. The Administration will work to resolve legal challenges so that they can implement the President's immigration policies.
