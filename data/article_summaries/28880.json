President Donald J. Trump has unveiled a plan to improve the nation's infrastructure by calling on Congress to pass legislation. The plan aims to increase investment, streamline permitting, strengthen rural areas, and modernize the workforce. The President's plan calls for a total investment of $1.5 trillion over 10 years, with $200 billion in federal funds. Half of the federal funds will be designated as matching funds to stimulate state, local, and private investment. The plan also addresses the issue of over-regulation by replacing sequential agency analysis with concurrent reviews, reducing the planning and permitting process from ten years to two. The plan focuses on rural projects, rebuilding roads, delivering clean water, expanding broadband, and supplying affordable and reliable power. The President also emphasizes the importance of investing in the American worker by providing access to affordable education and skills-development programs. Overall, the President's plan aims to improve the lives of American citizens and calls on Congress to deliver the infrastructure the American people deserve.
