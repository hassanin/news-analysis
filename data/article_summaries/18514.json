President Obama has signed an Executive Order outlining his regulatory strategy to support economic growth and job creation while protecting the safety and rights of Americans. The strategy focuses on designing cost-effective and evidence-based regulations that are compatible with economic growth and competitiveness. It also emphasizes the need for transparency, public participation, and coordination in the regulatory process. The President has also issued memorandums calling for more transparency and accountability in regulatory compliance, as well as the reduction of burdens on small businesses. The memorandums require federal enforcement agencies to make compliance information easily accessible to the public and encourage agencies to consider regulatory flexibilities for small businesses. These initiatives aim to create a more cost-effective and transparent regulatory system that supports economic strength and global competitiveness.
