On August 5, 2011, the President signed into law H.R. 2553, also known as the "Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2011, Part IV." This law extends various authorities related to the collection of taxes that fund the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, expenditures from the fund, and grants to airports under the Airport Improvement Program. Additionally, it places limitations on eligibility for the Transportation Department's Essential Air Service program, which provides subsidies to maintain commercial air service in small communities. The extension is effective until September 16, 2011.
