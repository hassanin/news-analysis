In this article, Vice President Mike Pence praises President Trump for his support of veterans. Pence highlights the administration's commitment to providing veterans with the benefits they have earned, rather than treating them as entitlements. He mentions that Trump has signed significant veterans' health-care reform, making Veterans Choice a permanent part of American law, which gives veterans access to real-time, world-class care. The law also aims to improve the recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals, expand healthcare choices, and enhance mental health services. Pence also mentions that Trump signed the Veterans Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, leading to the dismissal, suspension, or demotion of over 4,200 negligent VA employees. He further discusses the enactment of the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, which has resulted in the identification and payment of over $115 million in retroactive benefits. Pence also highlights the administration's efforts to end veteran homelessness, with 54,000 veterans finding permanent housing and supportive services in the last year. Lastly, Pence mentions Trump's steps to increase opportunities for veterans after they return to civilian life, such as enhancing and expanding the post-9/11 GI Bill. Overall, Pence emphasizes that the administration's actions have positively impacted veterans' healthcare, accountability, unemployment rates, and access to benefits.
