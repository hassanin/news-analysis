On July 20, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a statement to continue the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations. This national emergency was initially declared on July 24, 2011, through Executive Order 13581. The President declared this national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat posed by significant transnational criminal organizations to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. These organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous, and they are involved in activities that weaken democratic institutions, degrade the rule of law, undermine economic markets, and facilitate violent conflicts. The President's decision to continue this national emergency for another year is based on the belief that these criminal organizations still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States. The notice of this decision will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
