President Biden announced that a deal has been reached on infrastructure. He stated that while none of the parties involved got everything they wanted, compromises were made. The President emphasized the importance of bipartisan deals and the need for compromise. He mentioned that infrastructure was one of the agreed-upon areas, but other aspects of his Family Plan, such as childcare tax credits, were not included. He expressed hope for potential compromise in the reconciliation bill and the budget process. President Biden assured that he would stick with the proposed deal and thanked the individuals involved for their commitment. He also briefly mentioned being briefed on the building collapse in Miami and confirmed the existence of a two-track system for the infrastructure plan. When asked if he was confident in having all Democrats' support in the Senate, he deferred to the individuals involved.
