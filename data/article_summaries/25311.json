President Donald Trump has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to North Korea will continue beyond June 26, 2018. The national emergency was declared in Executive Order 13466 in 2008 and has been expanded and addressed in subsequent executive orders. The continued existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, along with the actions and policies of the North Korean government that destabilize the region and pose a threat to the United States and its allies, are cited as reasons for the extension of the national emergency.
