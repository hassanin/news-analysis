They commend those who have reached out to the less fortunate during this month, despite facing challenges in securing basic necessities and fundamental freedoms. The United States pledges to stand with those in need and uphold the dignity and rights of all people, whether they are hungry children in the Horn of Africa or young individuals fighting for freedom in the Middle East and North Africa.
