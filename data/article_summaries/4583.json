On November 26, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as a variant of concern. This variant was found to be increasing in cases in South Africa. In response, the United States implemented travel restrictions on noncitizens who had been in certain African countries within 14 days of their attempted entry into the U.S. However, after further understanding the Omicron variant and its spread, the CDC now recommends lifting these travel restrictions. The CDC has determined that vaccinated individuals are protected against severe disease and hospitalization from the Omicron variant. The Omicron variant has now spread to over 100 countries, including the United States. Additionally, the CDC has implemented stricter international travel protocols, such as requiring a negative COVID-19 test within 1 day of departure for all international air travelers to the U.S. As a result of these changes, President Biden has decided to revoke the travel restrictions imposed by Proclamation 10315. The Secretaries of State, Transportation, and Homeland Security will review any regulations or policies developed in response to the proclamation and make appropriate revisions. The revocation of Proclamation 10315 is effective from December 31, 2021.
