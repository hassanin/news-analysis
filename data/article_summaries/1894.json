The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has released initial guidance to federal agencies for the implementation of President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The guidance aims to ensure effective, efficient, and equitable implementation of the law, with minimal fraud, waste, and abuse. It emphasizes collaboration with Inspectors General (IGs) and the oversight community, as well as providing technical and financial assistance to communities. President Biden has a long-standing commitment to accountability and oversight, and the guidance reflects his dedication to robust oversight and stewardship of taxpayer dollars. The President and senior administration officials will meet with agency IGs to discuss steps taken to ensure oversight of federal programs. The guidance also directs agencies to invest public dollars efficiently, collaborate with IGs, and provide assistance to marginalized and underserved communities.
