This article is a notice from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Libya. The national emergency was initially declared in 2011 due to the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his government, which posed a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The declaration was made to address the use of weapons of war, mercenaries, and violence against unarmed civilians by the Libyan regime. There was also a concern that Libyan state assets would be misappropriated if not protected. The situation in Libya continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and the emergency declaration is extended for another year to prevent asset diversion or abuse by certain members of Qadhafi's family and former regime officials. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
