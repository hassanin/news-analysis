The article discusses the historical significance of Camp Nelson, located in Jessamine County, Kentucky, during the Civil War. Camp Nelson served as a recruitment center for African American soldiers and a refugee camp for their families. Thousands of enslaved African Americans risked their lives to escape slavery and seek freedom at Camp Nelson. The Emancipation Proclamation did not apply to Kentucky, but the state eventually allowed the enlistment of African American men. Camp Nelson became one of the largest contributors of United States Colored Troops, with over 10,000 troops enlisting or being trained there. The Union Army's efforts to remove refugees from Camp Nelson led to the tragic expulsion of approximately 400 African American women and children, causing the deaths of 102 refugees. In response, the Camp Nelson Home for Colored Refugees was established, providing a safe haven for the families of enlisted soldiers. After the war, Camp Nelson was closed and many of its military buildings were sold or dismantled. The Camp Nelson site has been designated as a National Historic Landmark and has now been proclaimed as the Camp Nelson National Monument, to be managed by the National Park Service. The article emphasizes the importance of preserving the history of Camp Nelson and the experiences of formerly enslaved African Americans during the Civil War.
