Vice President Mike Pence led a discussion with approximately 50 state governors and the White House Coronavirus Task Force to update them on COVID-19 response and recovery efforts. The meeting began with a prayer led by Rear Admiral Barry Black. Pence assured the governors that justice would be done in the case of George Floyd and emphasized the importance of protecting the rights, property, and lives of all citizens during civil unrest. The briefing focused on protecting vulnerable Americans, such as nursing home residents and those with underlying health conditions, particularly in African American, Hispanic, and Native American communities. The discussion also included best practices for reopening states and expanding testing, as well as protecting and supporting nursing home residents. The administration's support for the National Guard and the extension of Title 32 status for 49 states until August 21, 2020, were also highlighted.
