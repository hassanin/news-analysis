Poland and the United States have expressed their desire to strengthen cooperation on 5G networks, recognizing their importance for prosperity and national security. They believe that 5G will enable new applications and benefit citizens and economies. Protecting these networks from disruption and ensuring privacy and individual liberties is crucial. Both countries endorse the Prague Proposals, which emphasize the need for 5G networks to be built on free and fair competition, transparency, and the rule of law. They also highlight the importance of evaluating 5G component and software providers to ensure only trusted and reliable suppliers participate in the networks. This evaluation should consider factors such as control by a foreign government, transparent ownership structure, and ethical corporate behavior.
