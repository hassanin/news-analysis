President Obama has declared a major disaster in California due to the Valley Fire, which began on September 12, 2015. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. This includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Timothy J. Scranton has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by calling a toll-free number.
