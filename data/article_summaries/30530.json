The United States is expressing alarm over a missile strike by Houthi rebels against a Turkish cargo ship off the coast of Yemen. The ship was carrying wheat intended for Yemen's Saleef port. This incident highlights the threat of missile proliferation in Yemen and emphasizes the importance of enforcing United Nations Security Council Resolution 2216. There are also reports of the Houthis attempting to attack an oil tanker in the Red Sea, risking the spill of millions of barrels of oil and disrupting commerce. The US condemns the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for diverting Iranian resources to fuel conflicts in other countries and threaten international trade. The areas under Houthi control in Yemen are suffering, and the US urges the rebels to engage with the United Nations Special Envoy to work towards a better future for all Yemenis.
