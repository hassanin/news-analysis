The article is a proclamation issued by President Donald Trump on May 24, 2020. It states that due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the entry of aliens from certain countries with significant outbreaks, including China, Iran, the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, has been suspended and limited. The article further mentions that Brazil is now experiencing widespread transmission of the virus, leading to a decision to restrict and suspend the entry of all aliens who were physically present in Brazil during the 14-day period prior to their entry into the United States. However, there are exceptions for certain individuals, such as U.S. citizens and their immediate family members, lawful permanent residents, and individuals with specific visas. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of facilitating trade between the United States and Brazil and states that the restrictions are in the national interest of the United States. The proclamation will be implemented by the relevant authorities, including the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security. It will remain in effect until terminated by the President.
