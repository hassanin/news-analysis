The article discusses a Presidential Executive Order signed by President Barack Obama in 2009, which aimed to remove barriers to responsible scientific research involving human stem cells. The order revoked a previous order signed by President George W. Bush in 2007 that limited federal funding for research on human embryonic stem cells. The previous order allowed funding for cell lines created before August 9, 2001, but prohibited research on cell lines created after that date. President Obama's order lifted this restriction, stating that it had no scientific basis and was not required by any law. The order instructed the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop guidelines for the support and conduct of responsible human stem cell research. These guidelines would be based on scientific data and best practices and would be open for public comment. Within 120 days, the NIH would issue final guidance. The article highlights the potential of stem cell research to lead to better understanding and treatment of various diseases and conditions. The purpose of the Executive Order was to expand NIH support for stem cell research and enhance the contribution of American scientists to new discoveries and therapies for the benefit of humankind.
