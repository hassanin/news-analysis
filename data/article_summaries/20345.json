The United States has announced that it will not participate in the 10-year commemoration of the 2001 Durban Conference. The Durban process, which began at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in South Africa, has been marred by displays of intolerance and anti-Semitism. The United States had previously withdrawn from participating in the 2009 Durban Review Conference due to its reaffirmation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action (DDPA) from 2001, which unfairly singled out Israel. The DDPA also endorsed restrictions on freedom of expression that went against the US commitment to free speech. The United States voted against the resolution establishing the commemoration and did not participate in negotiations or the adoption of the Commemoration's Political Declaration. The US is committed to ending racism and racial discrimination and upholding human rights, and will continue to work with other nations to combat racism and bigotry.
