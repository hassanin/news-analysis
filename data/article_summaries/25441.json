The article discusses a book that contains speeches given by senior American officials, including Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump, about the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The speeches aim to educate the American people and allies about the CCP's conduct and its impact on livelihoods, businesses, freedoms, and values. They also serve to counter the CCP's propaganda machine and highlight the authoritarian model of China. The speeches cover various aspects, such as the CCP's whole-of-government approach, its global ambitions, espionage, intellectual property theft, and the need for a vigorous defense of national interests. President Trump also holds the CCP accountable for the Covid-19 pandemic and other actions, such as environmental devastation and illegal fishing. The article compares the book to the famous "Long Telegram" by George Kennan, but emphasizes that China, with its population size, economic power, and historic ambitions, is a more capable competitor than the Soviet Union.
