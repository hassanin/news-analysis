First Lady Michelle Obama has announced an agreement between the Partnership for a Healthier America and The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation (HWCF) to reduce 1.5 trillion product calories by the end of 2015. As an interim step, HWCF will aim to reduce calories by 1 trillion in 2012. The HWCF manufacturing companies will achieve this goal by introducing lower-calorie options, changing product recipes, or reducing portion sizes. The Partnership for a Healthier America aims to mobilize the private sector, media, and local communities to support the Let's Move! campaign and combat childhood obesity. The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation's efforts will be monitored annually to ensure accountability. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation will evaluate the impact of the calorie reduction efforts. The Partnership for a Healthier America focuses on developing a membership network, promoting understanding of healthy food and physical activity, facilitating and measuring commitments, and connecting potential partners. The Let's Move! campaign aims to address childhood obesity through four pillars: providing tools and information for parents, improving school food, increasing access to healthy food, and promoting physical activity. The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation is a coalition of retailers, non-profit organizations, manufacturers, and trade associations that aims to reduce obesity by helping families consume fewer calories and increase physical activity.
