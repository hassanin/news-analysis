The United States provided immediate diplomatic and financial support to Kyrgyzstan following the April 7 uprising. They redirected a significant portion of their existing assistance budget for Kyrgyzstan to address new priorities and doubled their assistance to $58 million after ethnic violence erupted in June. The US has coordinated with other countries and international organizations to support Kyrgyzstan in various areas such as humanitarian aid, economic support, food shortages, democratic processes, and reconciliation. Specific US assistance projects include community improvement and stabilization projects, addressing food shortages, strengthening democratic processes and institutions, supporting civil society, protecting human rights, and providing assistance to internally displaced persons. The US also provided support to organizations such as the International Committee for the Red Cross, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF, and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The US Department of Defense made payments of over $100 million to the Kyrgyz government through the Manas Transit Center, which also conducts its own humanitarian programs.
