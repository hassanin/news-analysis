President Obama will be pardoning two turkeys, Abe and Honest, in a ceremony in the Rose Garden. This tradition, which celebrates the National Thanksgiving Turkey presentation, has been ongoing for 68 years. The turkeys were named by California school children, and after the pardoning, they will be on display at Morven Park's "Turkey Hill" in Virginia. The turkeys were raised in California under the supervision of National Turkey Federation Chairman Dr. Jihad Douglas. Additionally, the First Family will be donating two turkeys from Jaindl Farms to the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington, DC.
