The White House Office of the Press Secretary has issued a fact sheet outlining new steps being taken by the Obama Administration to ensure openness and transparency in government. These steps include the creation of a Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address challenges with administering the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the promotion of a "release to one is a release to all" presumption, the launch of a centralized FOIA request portal, the issuance of new guidance on open government principles, and the signing of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. The fact sheet also highlights the Administration's record of progress in promoting transparency and openness, including releasing historic amounts of information, making federal datasets available, increasing agency accountability, and engaging the public through outreach and events.
