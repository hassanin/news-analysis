Vice President Biden is pressuring federal agencies to increase the extent and transparency of the reports submitted by recipients of federal recovery funds. While the majority of funding recipients have reported on the use of their funding, there is still missing information that is considered unacceptable. The Vice President wants to ensure that recipients fully meet their legal obligation to report and inform citizens about how Recovery Act dollars are being spent. Congress mandated that recipients report quarterly on the use and economic impact of the funds at the local level. The Vice President and the Office of Management and Budget are working with the Recovery Board to address concerns about data quality. In a memorandum to department and agency heads, OMB Director Peter Orszag is requiring federal agencies to identify non-compliant recipients, understand the reasons for non-compliance, and determine if any action is needed. The guidance states that failure to submit a required report makes recipients non-compliant, and agencies should consider a range of actions based on the severity of non-compliance. This includes helping recipients overcome technical challenges, revoking existing funds, barring recipients from future federal funds, or referring fraudulent cases for criminal investigation. The Administration is committed to providing an unprecedented level of transparency on the use of federal funds through the Recovery Act.
