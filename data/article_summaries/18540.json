The United States is expressing deep concern over the sentencing of Ilham Tohti, a prominent Uighur professor, to life imprisonment on charges of separatism. Tohti is known for his efforts to bridge the gap between Uighurs and Han Chinese. The US believes that civil society leaders like Tohti are crucial in reducing inter-ethnic tensions and should not be persecuted for peacefully expressing their views. The US is calling for the release of Tohti and his detained students, and for Chinese authorities to uphold their international human rights commitments. The US emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between peaceful dissent and violent extremism. While the US values its relationship with China, it will always advocate for universal rights, including freedom of expression, press freedom, and the freedoms of association and peaceful assembly. These freedoms are enshrined in both the US and Chinese constitutions, as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
