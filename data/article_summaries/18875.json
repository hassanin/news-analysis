First Lady Michelle Obama and Sesame Street's Big Bird have teamed up to film two public service announcements encouraging kids to eat healthy and get active. The PSAs are part of the Let's Move! initiative, which aims to ensure that all children grow up healthy and reach their full potential. The PSAs show Mrs. Obama and Big Bird in the White House, demonstrating how easy and delicious it is to eat healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables, as well as fun ways to get active like dancing and jumping. The PSAs will be distributed to PBS stations and posted on the Sesame Street and Let's Move! websites. This is part of the celebration of Let's Move!'s third anniversary, and the First Lady will kick off a nationwide tour to showcase progress and announce new ways the country is coming together around the health of children. Let's Move! was launched in 2010 to unite the country around children's health and has since made improvements in access to information, physical activity opportunities, school food, and childhood obesity rates.
