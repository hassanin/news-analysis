President Biden and his administration have expressed their commitment to continue using executive authority and the EPA's legally-upheld authorities to address climate change and protect public health. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in West Virginia v. EPA, they are determined to tackle environmental injustice, create jobs, and lower costs in the clean energy sector. National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy believes that the administration can still make progress in reducing emissions through creative approaches, such as engaging with the private sector and utilizing the Defense Production Act. EPA Administrator Michael Regan emphasizes that the agency will continue to regulate climate pollution and use all available tools to set and implement environmental standards. Both McCarthy and Regan assert that the administration has the legal authority and public mandate to address climate change and protect the environment. They also emphasize that the Biden administration is taking a whole-of-government approach and leaving no stone unturned in their efforts to invest in a clean energy future.
