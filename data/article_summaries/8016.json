The State Dining Room at the White House is being prepared for a state dinner, and the speaker reflects on the significance of setting a table as an act of love. The speaker's mother taught them how to create magical moments through simple touches like fresh flowers and candles. The speaker's husband taught them that politics is personal and about finding common threads of humanity. The state dinner is meant to bring these two ideas together as they welcome President Yoon and Mrs. Kim, honoring the alliance between their countries. The decor and menu for the dinner reflect the harmony of both cultures, with painted animals representing both countries, colors mirroring the South Korean flag, and symbolic flowers. The guests will dine under cherry trees, symbolizing the renewal of spring. Chef Edward Lee, known for his fusion cuisine, has designed the menu alongside the White House chefs. The evening will conclude with Broadway stars performing iconic songs, showcasing American creativity. The speaker expresses gratitude to the team that has worked hard to plan the dinner and aims to bring warmth and joy to the guests, honoring both their home nation and the shared roots of Americans. The Social Secretary, Carlos Elizondo, will provide further details.
