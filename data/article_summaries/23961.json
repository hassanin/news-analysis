On June 19, 2012, President Obama released a statement acknowledging the observance of Juneteenth. He highlighted that on this day in 1865, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, the people of Galveston, Texas were finally informed that the Civil War was over and all enslaved individuals were now free. The President acknowledged that although it took many more years of struggle for African Americans to gain equal treatment and protection under the law, Juneteenth is seen as a significant milestone in the journey towards a more perfect union. President Obama also mentioned recent achievements, such as the groundbreaking of the Smithsonian Museum dedicated to African American History and Culture, and the dedication of a monument to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., which serve as reminders of progress made as a nation. He encouraged Americans to use Juneteenth as an opportunity to reflect on how far the country has come and to recommit themselves to ensuring liberty and equal rights for all Americans.
