The National Security Council (NSC) has established a Unified Coordination Group (UCG) to respond to the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities. The UCG is composed of representatives from the FBI, CISA, and ODNI, with support from the NSA. The NSC recently held a UCG leadership meeting, which included private sector members for the first time, to coordinate response efforts. The UCG discussed unpatched systems, malicious exploitation, and ways to partner on incident response. The NSC requested Microsoft's help in providing a simple solution for small businesses affected by the incident, and Microsoft has released a one-click mitigation tool in response. The administration is committed to working with the private sector to enhance cybersecurity defenses and respond rapidly to cyber incidents.
