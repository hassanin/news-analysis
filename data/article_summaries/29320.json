The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced 340 continuation grants for its Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program. The program provides grants to community coalitions to address local youth substance use by strengthening partnerships and implementing prevention strategies. The ONDCP emphasizes the importance of educating children about the dangers of substance use and expanding community-based coalitions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recognizes the program's importance and commits to supporting youth substance use prevention. The grants represent a federal investment of approximately $42.5 million, and more grant awards will be announced in the future. Effective October 1, 2020, the CDC will take over the day-to-day management of the DFC Program under an agreement with the ONDCP.
