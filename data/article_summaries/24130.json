The United States has designated Nigeria-based groups Boko Haram and Ansaru as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists. These groups have been responsible for numerous attacks and thousands of deaths in Nigeria, including targeted killings, attacks on churches and mosques, and a suicide bombing in 2011. The designation will cut off these organizations from U.S. financial institutions and freeze their assets held in the United States. The United States expresses its support for Nigeria's fight against terrorism and encourages a comprehensive counterterrorism approach that includes effective law enforcement, economic opportunity, and the protection of human rights.
