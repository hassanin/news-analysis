The United States strongly condemns the deadly airstrikes carried out by the Asad regime on a market in Douma, Syria. Over 100 people were killed and hundreds more injured, including women and children. The US extends its condolences to the victims' families and emphasizes that this tragedy highlights the inhumane acts committed by the Asad regime against the Syrian people. The regime is responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians and the destruction of towns, cities, historical sites, schools, mosques, markets, and hospitals. These actions demonstrate that the Asad regime has lost legitimacy, and the international community needs to take further action to facilitate a genuine political transition in Syria.
