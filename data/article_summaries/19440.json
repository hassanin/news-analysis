President Obama granted pardons to five individuals and commuted the sentence of one individual. The pardons were granted to individuals convicted of offenses such as conspiracy to manufacture, possess, and distribute marijuana, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, aiding and abetting in the manufacture of marijuana plants, conspiracy to transport stolen property, and conducting an illegal gambling business. The commutation was granted to an individual convicted of distribution of cocaine base. The terms of the commutation state that the prison sentence will expire on December 21, 2011, while the eight-year term of supervised release and other components of the sentence will remain in effect.
