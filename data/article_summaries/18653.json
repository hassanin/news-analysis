Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine. President Poroshenko informed the Vice President that the Ukrainian government had proposed various locations for negotiating a ceasefire with the pro-Russian separatists, but all offers were rejected by Russia or the separatists. The Vice President commended Ukraine's efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and implement President Poroshenko's peace plan for long-term stability. He also mentioned that the United States was discussing with its international partners the need to hold Russia accountable for supporting the separatists, including providing heavy weapons and equipment across the border. The Vice President agreed with President Poroshenko on the importance of establishing an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) border monitoring mission in Ukraine, which could potentially expand to monitor a future ceasefire. They also emphasized the immediate release of Ukrainian hostages held by the separatists.
