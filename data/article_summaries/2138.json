The Biden-Harris Administration has released its National Strategy to Advance Equity, Justice, and Opportunity for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) Communities. The strategy includes action plans from 32 federal agencies, addressing issues such as data disaggregation, language access, and combating anti-Asian hate. President Biden signed an executive order in May 2021 to establish and reinvigorate the White House Initiative on AA and NHPI. Since then, the administration has prioritized the needs of these communities by promoting equity, reducing barriers to federal services, and centering their experiences. The strategy focuses on promoting belonging and inclusion, addressing anti-Asian hate and discrimination, improving data collection, expanding language access, building capacity in AA and NHPI communities, creating a diverse federal workforce, and increasing outreach and engagement efforts.
