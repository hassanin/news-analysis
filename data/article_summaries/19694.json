Leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the President of the European Council, and the President of the European Commission met in The Hague to express their support for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence. They condemn the illegal referendum held in Crimea and Russia's attempt to annex Crimea, both of which violate international law. They have imposed sanctions against Russia and are prepared to intensify these actions if the situation escalates further. They urge Russia to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity, engage in discussions with the Ukrainian government, and accept offers of international mediation. The leaders also announce that they will not participate in the planned Sochi Summit and will suspend their participation in the G-8 until Russia changes course. They will meet in G-7 format in Brussels in June 2014 to discuss the agenda. They express their support for the people of Ukraine and their reform agenda, with the International Monetary Fund playing a central role in supporting Ukrainian reform and integrating the country into the multilateral system. They commit to providing financial backing, technical assistance, and assistance in areas such as trade and energy security to Ukraine.
