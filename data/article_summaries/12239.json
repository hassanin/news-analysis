President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring October as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. The proclamation highlights the progress made in changing laws and attitudes towards domestic violence, but also acknowledges that more work needs to be done. The proclamation emphasizes the need to support survivors and provide them with necessary resources, as well as the importance of preventing domestic violence before it occurs. The Affordable Care Act has made domestic violence screening and counseling available as a preventive service for women, and a new initiative has been developed to reduce domestic violence homicides through high-risk screening and victim services. The proclamation calls on all Americans to speak out against domestic violence and support local efforts to assist victims.
