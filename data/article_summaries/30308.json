This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on April 12, 2018, establishes a Task Force on the United States Postal Service (USPS) to evaluate the operations and finances of the USPS. The USPS is facing a structural deficit due to factors such as a decline in First-Class Mail volume and legal mandates that require them to incur significant costs. The USPS has incurred cumulative losses of $65 billion since the 2007-2009 recession and has been unable to make payments for retiree health benefit obligations. The Task Force will be chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and will include heads of various departments and agencies. It will evaluate the USPS's role in competitive markets, the decline in mail volume, the definition of "universal service obligation," the USPS's role in the economy and rural areas, and the USPS's business model, workforce, operations, costs, and pricing. The Task Force will develop recommendations for administrative and legislative reforms to ensure the USPS operates under a sustainable business model. A report summarizing the findings and recommendations must be submitted to the President within 120 days of the order. The Federal Financing Bank will provide administrative support and funding for the Task Force.
