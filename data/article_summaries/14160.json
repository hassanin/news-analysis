The White House has released a report highlighting the economic benefits of the bipartisan Senate immigration reform bill for the agriculture sector and rural communities. The report states that the agriculture sector has seen strong growth in recent years, with farm income and agriculture exports reaching historic highs. However, the agriculture industry is hindered by a broken immigration system that does not support a stable workforce. The industry heavily relies on foreign-born workers, and there are not enough U.S. workers to meet labor needs. The Senate bill proposes providing a path to citizenship for undocumented farmworkers, which would give them security and the ability to invest in their skills and education. The bill would also strengthen border security and establish a temporary worker program. The report highlights that strength in agricultural production supports the economy, particularly in rural communities. An expanded temporary worker program would raise GDP and contribute to the continuity of rural America. The report calls on Republican leadership in the House to take action and fix the broken immigration system.
