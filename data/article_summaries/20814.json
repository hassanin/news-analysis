The White House is urging the House of Representatives to focus on immigration reform and reopen the government. They highlight the bipartisan support for immigration reform and the potential economic benefits it could bring. The Senate has already passed a strong bipartisan immigration reform bill, and House Democrats have introduced a similar bill. The White House is calling on House Republicans to put politics aside and work together with Democrats to fix the broken immigration system and strengthen the economy.
