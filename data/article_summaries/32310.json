On August 14, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring the continuation of a national emergency related to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979. The President cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as the basis for this declaration. The implementation of certain sanctions authorities is to be carried out under this act, requiring the national emergency to continue beyond its original expiration date of August 17, 2019. This extension of the national emergency was made in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
