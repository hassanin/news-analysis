The White House has announced new steps to cut red tape and eliminate unnecessary regulations that are expected to save businesses and consumers nearly $6 billion. This is part of the Obama Administration's government-wide regulatory review, which aims to reduce unnecessary regulations while promoting economic growth and protecting public health, safety, welfare, and the environment. The President has signed a new Executive Order that makes it an ongoing obligation for the government to scrutinize rules to see if they make sense. The President's Council of Economic Advisers has also issued a report on the progress of the regulatory review, noting that agencies have identified over 500 reforms that will save more than $10 billion over the next five years. The new Executive Order directs agencies to prioritize reforms that produce significant savings and to seek public input on rules that need review. Agencies are also required to provide regular reports on their past efforts and future plans. The White House has finalized five major regulatory reforms, including increasing flexibility for states and local highway agencies in adopting traffic control rules, eliminating unnecessary regulatory costs for the railroad industry, saving doctors and hospitals $5 billion, and getting rid of outdated regulatory burdens for gas stations. Overall, these measures aim to streamline regulations, eliminate unnecessary costs, and promote efficiency.
