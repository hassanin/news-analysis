The Trump administration has imposed financial sanctions on several current and former officials in Venezuela, ahead of a critical vote that could grant President Nicol√°s Maduro extended powers. The vote, scheduled for Sunday, aims to change Venezuela's constitution to allow Maduro to remain in power for an extended period. The sanctions have received support from Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who believes that the international community should follow the lead of the US and other countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, and Chile, in urging Maduro to suspend the vote. The editorial argues that Maduro's regime is suppressing freedoms and causing an economic crisis in the country, and calls for strong international support to help the Venezuelan people.
