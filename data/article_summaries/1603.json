The Biden-Harris Administration has announced commitments to implement the Declaration on U.S.-Pacific Partnership. This marks a new milestone in U.S.-Pacific cooperation, building on a long history of strong ties. The United States has provided over $1.5 billion in support to the Pacific Islands over the past decade and has announced over $810 million in additional expanded programs. The initiatives aim to improve the lives of Pacific Islanders through various measures such as expanding diplomatic engagement, combatting the climate crisis, launching a new Trade and Investment Dialogue, providing development assistance, enhancing maritime security, expanding educational opportunities, addressing war legacies, and more. The Biden-Harris Administration also plans to strengthen and support the U.S.-Pacific Islands partnership, build U.S. capacity in the Pacific, coordinate with allies and partners, take urgent action on the climate crisis, forge economic partnerships, bolster security cooperation, improve digital connectivity and cyber security, combat COVID-19, and address war legacies.
