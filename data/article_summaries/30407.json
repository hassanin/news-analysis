The article is a transcript of a press briefing held by Acting Director Matt Albence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Albence discusses the human cost of sanctuary laws and policies that prevent local law enforcement agencies from cooperating with ICE. He argues that these laws make communities less safe and result in preventable crimes. Albence emphasizes the need for cooperation between law enforcement agencies and calls on lawmakers to prioritize public safety over politics. He also highlights the success of programs like 287(g) in facilitating collaboration between state and local enforcement agencies and ICE. The briefing concludes with statements from Sheriff Jim Skinner from Collin County, Texas, and Sheriff Wayne Ivey from Brevard County, Florida, who express their support for working with ICE to combat illegal immigration and protect their communities.
