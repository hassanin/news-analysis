President Joe Biden has announced three nominees for the United States Postal Service (USPS) Board of Governors: Anton Hajjar, Amber McReynolds, and Ron Stroman. These nominees have been chosen to ensure that the USPS operates at the highest service standards and effectively serves all communities in the country.

Anton Hajjar is a former general counsel of the American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, and has extensive experience representing unions and union workers. He has also been involved in employment discrimination cases, particularly those affecting Arab- and Muslim-Americans after the 9/11 attacks. Hajjar is currently a legal adviser to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.

Amber McReynolds is an expert in election administration and policy. She is currently the CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, a non-partisan non-profit organization that aims to improve vote-by-mail systems across all fifty states. McReynolds previously served as the Director of Elections for the City and County of Denver, where she implemented a pioneering ballot tracking and communication program.

Ron Stroman, the third nominee, recently held the position of Deputy Postmaster General and Chief Governmental Relations Officer for the USPS. He has also worked in various roles in the House of Representatives, including Staff Director and Minority Staff Director for the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Stroman has experience in executive roles at the U.S. Department of Transportation and as an attorney at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

These nominees bring a wealth of experience and expertise to the USPS Board of Governors, emphasizing President Biden's commitment to the success of the USPS and its ability to serve all communities effectively and efficiently.
