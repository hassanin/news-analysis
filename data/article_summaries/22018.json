The White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, announced the start of President Obama's summer service initiative, United We Serve. The initiative calls on all Americans to join a volunteer effort this summer and be part of building a new foundation for America one community at a time. United We Serve officially starts today and runs through the National Day of Service and Remembrance on September 11th. The President is calling on all Americans to participate in projects that focus on four key areas: energy and the environment, healthcare, education, and community renewal. The President and First Lady are calling on all Americans to visit the Corporation for National and Community Services website, www.serve.gov, to find service projects in their community. The First Lady, as well as 19 Cabinet Secretaries and senior administration officials, are participating in service projects across the country to mark the kickoff of United We Serve. In the briefing, Gibbs also discussed the Medicare prescription drug agreement and negotiations with Iran. He mentioned that the President still struggles with smoking and that the administration is taking steps to deal with the North Korean threat. Gibbs also addressed concerns about public support for the administration's policies and the President's upcoming press conference.
