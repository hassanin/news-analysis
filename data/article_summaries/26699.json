On May 21, 2018, President Donald J. Trump issued executive orders related to foreign policy. The orders were issued in response to the ongoing activities of the Maduro regime in Venezuela, including economic mismanagement, public corruption, repression of the political opposition, and a deepening humanitarian crisis. The executive orders prohibit certain transactions, financing, and dealings related to the Venezuelan government, including the purchase of debt owed to the government, the sale or transfer of equity interests in government-owned entities, and any transactions that evade or violate these prohibitions. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to implement these orders. The orders are effective as of May 21, 2018.
