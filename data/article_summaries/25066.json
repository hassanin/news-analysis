In a press briefing, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that President Trump had signed an executive order that gives the US government greater ability to cut off funding to North Korea and its weapons development program. The executive order expands the Treasury's authorities to target those who enable the regime's economic activity. It authorizes sanctions such as suspending US correspondent account access to any foreign bank conducting significant transactions with North Korea. The order also enables the freezing of assets of anyone conducting significant trade with North Korea. Mnuchin called on all countries to cut off trade and financial ties with North Korea to achieve a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. He emphasized that the order is not specifically directed at China, but rather at anyone doing business with North Korea. Mnuchin also mentioned that he had a productive conversation with the Governor of the People's Bank of China and that the US looks forward to working closely with China on this issue.
