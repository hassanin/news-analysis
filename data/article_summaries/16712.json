In this joint op-ed by President Barack Obama, Prime Minister David Cameron, and President Nicolas Sarkozy, they discuss the ongoing crisis in Libya and the pathway to peace for the Libyan people. They highlight that the international community was compelled to act due to the chaos caused by Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi attacking his own people. The United Nations Security Council authorized all necessary measures to protect the people of Libya, which led to the intervention of the United States, France, and Britain, along with an international coalition. While tens of thousands of lives have been protected, the people of Libya continue to suffer under Qaddafi's rule. The leaders emphasize that their duty is to protect civilians, not remove Qaddafi by force, but they believe it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with him in power. They argue that leaving Qaddafi in power would not only make Libya a pariah state but also a failed state, as he has threatened to carry out terrorist attacks and has lost the consent of his people. They propose a pathway to peace that involves an end to violence, a transition from dictatorship to an inclusive constitutional process, and the assistance of the United Nations and its members in rebuilding Libya. They state that this vision has the support of a broad coalition of countries, including many from the Arab world, and that NATO and their partners will continue their efforts until the Libyan people can choose their own future.
