On June 26, 2001, President Biden declared a national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans due to the threat posed by extremist violence and acts obstructing the implementation of peace agreements in the region. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The President subsequently amended the order in 2003 to address specific actions obstructing the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement in North Macedonia. On June 8, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14033, expanding the scope of the national emergency to include the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Albania. This expansion was based on concerns about the undermining of post-war agreements, widespread corruption, and the lack of effective and democratic governance in the region. The actions of individuals threatening peace and stability, as well as the overall situation in the Western Balkans, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. As a result, President Biden has decided to continue the national emergency for an additional year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
