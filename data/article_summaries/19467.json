The article discusses a commitment made by nurses across the United States to support veterans and military families. Over 150 nursing organizations and 500 nursing schools have pledged to educate nurses on how to recognize and care for veterans impacted by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and other combat-related issues. The American Nurses Association, American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, American Association of Colleges of Nursing, and the National League for Nursing are leading this effort in coordination with the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense. The goal is to ensure that nurses in every community have access to the most current, evidence-based treatments and resources for PTSD and TBI. The commitment also includes disseminating effective care models and sharing up-to-date information on these conditions across academic and practice settings. Over 3 million nurses will be reached by 2015 to raise awareness of these issues among veterans, military service members, and their families. This initiative is important because many veterans seek care outside of the Veterans Affairs (VA) health system and visit local hospitals staffed by nurses and doctors in their communities. The commitment from nurses is seen as crucial in providing the necessary care and support to veterans and their families.
