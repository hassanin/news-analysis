President Donald J. Trump will award the Medal of Honor to Master Sergeant Matthew O. Williams, United States Army, on October 30, 2019. Sergeant Williams is being recognized for his conspicuous gallantry while serving as a Weapons Sergeant in Support of Operation Enduring Freedom. On April 6, 2008, Sergeant Williams exposed himself to insurgent fire multiple times to rescue other members of his assault element and evacuate numerous casualties. He led an Afghan Commando element across a fast-moving, waist-deep river and fought his way up a terraced mountain to the besieged lead element of the assault force. Sergeant Williams set up a base of fire that the enemy was unable to overcome and helped move injured soldiers to safety. His actions saved the lives of four critically wounded soldiers and prevented the lead element from being overrun. Sergeant Williams joined the Army in 2005 and deployed to Afghanistan in 2008. He is currently serving at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
