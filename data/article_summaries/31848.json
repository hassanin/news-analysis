President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on January 24, 2020, declaring January 26 to February 1 as National School Choice Week. In the proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of providing children with the opportunity to pursue an educational environment that matches their learning style and prepares them for fulfilling lives. Trump criticizes the current education system, stating that it has failed too many children, with about two-thirds of students not being proficient readers. He argues for the expansion of school choice, including options such as public, charter, magnet, private, religious, home, and online education programs. Trump calls on Congress to pass a federal tax credit to support state-based educational choice programs and to expand and make permanent the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. He concludes by stating that education can open doors and challenges lawmakers to ensure that every child has the opportunity to fulfill their potential and achieve the American Dream.
