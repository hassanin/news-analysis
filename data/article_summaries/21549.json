On December 4, 2015, the President signed into law H.R. 22, also known as the "Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act)." This law authorizes funding for surface transportation programs from 2016 to 2020 and reauthorizes taxes that support the Highway Trust Fund until September 30, 2022. It also extends the expiration date of the Export-Import Bank until September 30, 2019 and includes provisions to improve the Federal permit review process for major infrastructure projects.
