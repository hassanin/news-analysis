The Biden-Harris Administration has announced over $73 million in outreach grants to help connect more Americans with affordable, high-speed internet. This funding is part of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which aims to lower the cost of internet access. Currently, over 16.75 million households are saving over $500 million per month through the ACP. The lack of affordable, reliable high-speed internet disproportionately affects communities of color, rural areas, and older Americans. To address this, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to make changes and allocate $65 billion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for affordable, high-speed internet. The ACP provides eligible households with up to $30/month off internet bills, as well as a one-time discount of up to $100 off a device. Internet service providers have also committed to offering fully covered high-speed plans through the ACP. The Vice President has made a call to action for states and federal agencies to spread awareness about the ACP, resulting in over 16 million households being reached and saving Americans over half-a-billion dollars per month. The Biden-Harris Administration's Internet for All Initiative aims to ensure that everyone in America has access to reliable and affordable high-speed internet.
