Vice President Biden has announced that $100 million will be available to increase access to mental health services and improve mental health facilities. The funding includes $50 million for mental health services at Community Health Centers, which can be used to hire new mental health professionals and add mental health and substance abuse disorder services. The Department of Agriculture will also provide $50 million to improve mental health facilities in rural areas, using tools like telemedicine to expand access to mental health services. These efforts build on the Administration's previous actions to reduce stigma and ensure access to mental health care, such as the expansion of mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits under the Affordable Care Act. The President's FY 2014 Budget proposes an additional $130 million initiative to address barriers to accessing mental health care, including training teachers to recognize signs of mental illness and referring students to services, supporting the training of more mental health professionals, and implementing strategies to help young people with mental health or substance abuse issues. The Administration is calling on Congress to appropriate funds for these purposes.
