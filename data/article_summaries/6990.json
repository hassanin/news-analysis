President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed April 2021 as National Cancer Control Month in the United States. Despite advancements in recent years, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the country. The President acknowledges the distress of receiving a cancer diagnosis and the toll it takes on patients and their loved ones. The focus of National Cancer Control Month is to prevent cancer, improve treatments and care delivery, and find a cure. Efforts include promoting healthy habits such as quitting smoking, eating well, exercising regularly, limiting alcohol consumption, and reducing sun exposure. The government supports programs that provide cancer screenings and access to clinical trials. The Cancer Moonshot initiative, launched in 2016, has accelerated progress in cancer prevention, treatment, and cures. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in cancer care, but the President urges Americans not to delay screenings and treatment. The Affordable Care Act ensures that most health insurance plans cover preventive services, including cancer screenings. The President encourages citizens, organizations, and businesses to participate in activities that raise awareness about cancer prevention and control.
