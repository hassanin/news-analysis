The article discusses the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the recent SDG Summit in New York. The SDGs aim to improve lives and wellbeing globally by expanding economic opportunities, promoting social justice, caring for the planet, and ensuring no one is left behind. However, the world is currently only on track to achieve 15% of the SDG targets. The United States, as a leading global development partner, is committed to implementing the SDGs and has invested over $100 billion in Official Development Assistance in the last two years alone. The United States calls for collaboration between nations, private sector, civil society, and local partners to mobilize additional financing, knowledge, data, and policy environments to achieve the SDGs.
