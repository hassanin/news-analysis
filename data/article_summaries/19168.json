President Obama met with Senate Democrats to discuss the need for legislation that would give him the authority to complete negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and enforce the agreement. The senators in attendance expressed their support for Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation, which would enable the United States to create high-standard trade agreements that protect American jobs, workers, and the environment. The senators and the President are committed to working together to ensure fair competition in the global economy.
