The President has designated the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the lead federal department for facilitating the entry of vulnerable Afghans into the United States. The DHS will coordinate efforts across the federal government to resettle Afghans, including those who worked on behalf of the United States. This includes immigration processing, COVID-19 testing, quarantine for COVID-positive individuals, and resettlement support for non-citizens and non-permanent residents. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a Unified Coordination Group and appoint a Senior Response Official to lead and coordinate the group. The official will work with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial officials, as well as private sector and non-governmental entities, and will communicate with affected parties and the public. All federal departments and agencies are expected to cooperate and support the DHS in a unified federal response. This memorandum does not affect the responsibilities of other federal departments and agencies under the law.
