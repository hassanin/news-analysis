President Barack Obama has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency declared with respect to Iran will continue beyond its anniversary date of March 15, 2010. The crisis between the United States and Iran, which led to the declaration of the national emergency in 1995, has not been resolved. The actions and policies of the Iranian government are contrary to the interests of the United States and pose a continuing threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. Therefore, comprehensive sanctions against Iran will be maintained to address this threat.
