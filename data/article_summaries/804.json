President Joe Biden has announced his intent to nominate Vivek Murthy as the Representative of the United States on the Executive Board of the World Health Organization (WHO). Murthy is currently serving as the Surgeon General of the United States and will continue in that role alongside his new responsibilities. As Surgeon General, Murthy's mission is to provide clear, consistent, and equitable guidance and resources for the public, drawing attention to critical public health issues such as health misinformation, youth mental health, well-being and burnout in the health worker community, and social isolation and loneliness. In addition to his role as Surgeon General, Murthy commands a uniformed service of over 6,000 public health officers as the Vice Admiral of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. He is also the first Surgeon General of Indian descent and is a renowned physician, research scientist, entrepreneur, and author. Murthy resides in Washington, DC with his wife and two children.
