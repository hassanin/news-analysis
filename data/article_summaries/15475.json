The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a fact sheet on January 26, 2015, about the efforts to foster a cleaner and more sustainable energy future in the Caribbean. The Caribbean Energy Security Initiative (CESI) was launched in June 2014, and this summit aimed to work together with Caribbean leaders and international partners to support Caribbean energy security. The summit discussed goals for the energy sectors in the Caribbean and how the United States and other partners can support the Caribbean in pursuing alternative sources of energy. The World Bank proposed the creation of a Caribbean Energy Investment Network to improve coordination and communication among development partners and empower Caribbean nations to align external support with their own national goals. The United States' Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) announced financing for a wind project in Jamaica, which will be a tangible example of public and private sectors working together. The fact sheet also highlighted additional assistance from the U.S. government to promote a cleaner and more secure energy future in the Caribbean, such as technical assistance programs, support for cleaner energy sources, development of collaborative networks on clean energy, financing clean energy projects, increasing energy efficiency, and expanding access to electricity and technology.
