In a press conference at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, President Biden addressed several topics. Regarding the debt limit, he expressed his hope that Republicans would not refuse to raise it, as they have done in the past. He attributed the significant debt to their tax cuts. On the topic of Republicans and Fox News changing their stance on the COVID-19 vaccine, Biden thanked them for their shift and expressed his belief that the realization of the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing severe illness had prompted their change of heart. He also commented on the Nord Stream deal, acknowledging that it was unlikely anything could stop its completion but highlighting discussions with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on a commitment to respond if Russia intentionally harmed Ukraine or other countries. In response to a question about breakthrough COVID-19 cases among fully vaccinated individuals, Biden reassured that such cases were rare and generally not severe. Finally, he commented on the January 6th insurrection, stating that the American public understands what happened and that it was not a partisan issue.
