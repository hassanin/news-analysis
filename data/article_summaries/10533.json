President Barack Obama has issued an executive order terminating the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13047 of May 20, 1997, and revoking several other related orders. The national emergency was declared in response to the actions and policies of the Government of Burma, which posed a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. However, the President has determined that the situation in Burma has significantly improved, with advancements in promoting democracy, including historic elections in 2015 and the formation of a democratically elected government. As a result, U.S. national security and foreign policy interests no longer support the blocking of assets and other measures imposed by the previous executive orders. While acknowledging the challenges that Burma still faces, the United States intends to support the government and people of Burma through other means. Additionally, the President has waived the sanctions described in section 5(b) of the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act, as it is in the national interest of the United States to do so.
