President Barack Obama has proclaimed February 2016 as National African American History Month. In his proclamation, he recognizes the contributions and sacrifices made by African Americans throughout history. He highlights the fight for civil rights, from the abolitionist movement to the modern-day civil rights movement, and acknowledges the progress that has been made in areas such as education and employment. However, he also acknowledges the challenges that still exist, including disparities in the criminal justice system and educational and employment opportunities. He calls on citizens to address these inequalities and work towards ensuring equal rights for all. The proclamation encourages public officials, educators, librarians, and the American people to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
