President Barack Obama has issued a message to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Belarus will continue beyond June 16, 2010. The decision to extend the emergency is based on the actions and policies of certain individuals in the Belarusian government who have undermined democratic processes, committed human rights abuses, and engaged in public corruption. Despite efforts to promote democracy and reform in Belarus, significant challenges persist. The President believes that these actions pose an ongoing and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, necessitating the continuation of the national emergency and related measures blocking the property of certain individuals.
