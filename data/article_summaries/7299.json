The White House recently held a meeting with state and local leaders to showcase successful efforts in protecting tenants and preventing evictions. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen emphasized the importance of keeping people in their homes and announced the removal of burdensome documentation requirements for rental assistance. The Treasury Department is prepared to reallocate funds from programs that are not efficiently distributing assistance to those that are. The White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator, Gene Sperling, highlighted the progress made by certain states and urged for further acceleration in distributing rental assistance. Efforts to accelerate rental assistance are aimed at keeping people in their homes. The meeting also discussed the implementation of eviction moratoria and the availability of resources for other governments to learn from successful programs.
