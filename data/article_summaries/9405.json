President Biden addressed the nation from the East Room, providing an update on the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the state of the economy. He praised the Senate for taking steps towards passing the bill, which he believes will create millions of jobs and put America on a path to economic success in the 21st century. The bill focuses on investments in roads, rail, transit, bridges, clean energy, and clean water.

The President thanked the bipartisan group of senators and committee chairs for their input and expressed confidence that the Senate will establish a framework for the rest of his Build Back Better agenda. This agenda includes tax cuts for the middle class, investments in childcare and home care for seniors, combating climate change, and building a clean energy future.

President Biden also highlighted the positive economic news, with 943,000 new jobs created in July and a decrease in the unemployment rate to 5.4%. He credited the success to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the American Rescue Plan, which provided economic relief and assistance to combat the pandemic.

While acknowledging the progress, President Biden emphasized the need for more vaccinations to combat the Delta variant and protect the economy. He encouraged people to get vaccinated and announced new incentives and requirements for federal workers. The President also outlined six actions to strengthen the fight against the Delta variant and support the economy, such as the distribution of monthly checks through the Child Tax Credit and assistance to schools, renters, landlords, and small businesses.

In conclusion, President Biden urged Americans to stay the course, get vaccinated, and work together to overcome the challenges ahead. He expressed optimism about the future of the country and its economic recovery.
