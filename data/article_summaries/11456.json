The article discusses the White House's initiatives to drive innovation and encourage companies to invest in the United States. The President launched the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) in 2011, bringing together industry, universities, and the government to invest in emerging technologies and skills that support the manufacturing sector. The manufacturing sector is crucial for innovation, as it accounts for 70% of private-sector R&D spending and employs 60% of the private sector R&D workforce. The AMP Steering Committee has outlined recommendations in three categories: enabling innovation, securing the talent pipeline, and improving the business climate. The President's plan includes proposals for a national network of manufacturing innovation institutes, increasing investment in advanced manufacturing R&D, creating a Community College to Career Fund, launching a Military Credentialing and Licensing Task Force, reforming the tax code, promoting the safe development of natural gas resources, and leveling the playing field for U.S. workers and firms.
