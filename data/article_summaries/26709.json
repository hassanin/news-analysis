The Trump administration has announced two policies aimed at reforming the international sale of U.S.-produced arms and the export of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The new policies are intended to strengthen economic and national security, fortify defense relationships with allies, and bolster their capabilities. The U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy Presidential Memorandum provides organizing principles and objectives for arms sales, while the UAS export policy enables U.S. firms to undertake direct sales to authorized allies and partners. The policies aim to ensure that American interests are put first, improve defense trade efficiency and flexibility, and maintain the U.S. military's technological edge. By providing allies and partners with greater access to U.S.-produced arms, the reliance on Chinese knockoffs and Russian systems can be reduced. These reforms will strengthen American industry, national security, and international partnerships, promoting American prosperity and peace through strength.
