On March 9, 2009, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13505, titled "Removing Barriers to Responsible Scientific Research Involving Human Stem Cells." The order aimed to support and expand research on human embryonic stem cells and human non-embryonic stem cells, as they have the potential to lead to better understanding and treatment of various diseases and conditions. The order removed limitations on federal funding for human stem cell research that were previously imposed by the Department of Health and Human Services. It authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to support and conduct responsible and scientifically worthy human stem cell research within the confines of the law. The order also mandated the Secretary, through the Director of NIH, to review and update existing guidance on human stem cell research within 120 days and issue new NIH guidance that aligns with the order. The implementation of the order was subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations. It did not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other entity. The order also revoked the Presidential statement of August 9, 2001, which limited federal funding for research involving human embryonic stem cells, as well as Executive Order 13435 of June 20, 2007, which supplemented the 2001 statement.
