The White House Office of the Press Secretary issued a press release summarizing a press briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes, and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman. The briefing took place at the Intercontinental Hotel in Beijing, China. Ambassador Froman announced a breakthrough in negotiations with China on the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), a WTO agreement that eliminates tariffs on high-tech products among 54 economies. The agreement is expected to pave the way for the resumption of ITA negotiations in Geneva and be the first major tariff-cutting agreement in the WTO in 17 years. The ITA is estimated to eliminate tariffs on roughly $1 trillion of global sales of IT products and support up to 60,000 additional U.S. jobs in technology and manufacturing. In addition to the ITA, the briefing covered other aspects of President Obama's trip to China, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, the President's upcoming meetings with President Xi Jinping, and discussions on issues such as clean energy, climate change, regional security, military-to-military relationships, Iran's nuclear program, cybersecurity, and human rights. The briefing also addressed the President's legacy with China and the impact of sanctions on Russia.
