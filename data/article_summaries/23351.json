The Obama Administration has announced four surface transportation projects that will be expedited as part of the We Can't Wait initiative. These projects aim to replace aging infrastructure and improve the reliability and resiliency of critical highway, transit, and rail systems in Maine, North Dakota, Oregon, and Washington State. The coordination among agencies will save several months to over a year on these projects. The projects include the Kennebec Bridge Replacement Project in Maine, the Devils Lake Rail Improvements project in North Dakota, the Columbia River Crossing project in Oregon and Washington, and the Point Defiance Bypass project in Washington. These projects will improve connectivity and provide for the safe and efficient movement of people, goods, and services. The expedited review and permitting process is part of the Administration's efforts to make infrastructure projects more efficient and effective, allowing for faster modernization of the nation's infrastructure.
