President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation establishing the Honouliuli National Monument in Hawaii. The Honouliuli Internment Camp served as a reminder of the importance of protecting civil liberties during times of conflict and the effects of martial law on civil society. The camp was significant during World War II as it interned a diverse population, including American citizens, resident immigrants, enemy soldiers, and labor conscripts. The treatment of Japanese Americans in Hawaii differed from that on the mainland, but both experienced racial prejudice and a failure of political leadership. The camp opened in 1943 and became the largest and longest-used confinement site in Hawaii. It housed both civilian internees and prisoners of war, including individuals of Japanese, German, Italian, Irish, Russian, and Scandinavian descent. Honouliuli closed in 1945 and was largely forgotten until its rediscovery in 1998. The establishment of the national monument aims to preserve and protect the historic objects at Honouliuli and study and interpret the history of World War II internment and detention in Hawaii. The management plan for the monument will be prepared within three years, and the National Park Service will coordinate with other organizations associated with World War II internment.
