President Obama expressed his sadness over the passing of Geraldine Ferraro, recognizing her as a trailblazer who broke down barriers for women and Americans from all backgrounds. He highlighted her various roles as a public school teacher, assistant district attorney, Member of Congress, and candidate for Vice President, where she fought for equality, justice, and opportunity for all. As the Ambassador to the UN Human Rights Commission, she also advocated for these ideals worldwide. The President noted that Sasha and Malia, his daughters, will grow up in a more equal America because of Ferraro's life and achievements. He extended his thoughts and prayers to her husband, John Zaccaro, her children and grandchildren, and their entire family.
