Hanwha Q CELLS, a South Korean solar energy company, has announced the largest solar investment in U.S. history. This investment is a result of the economic plan and Inflation Reduction Act put forth by the speaker. The investment will create numerous well-paying jobs in Georgia, with many not requiring a four-year degree. It will also bring back supply chains to reduce reliance on other countries, decrease the cost of clean energy, and aid in combating the climate crisis. Additionally, it will contribute to the domestic manufacturing of advanced solar technology. The speaker believes this investment is a victory for workers, consumers, and the environment, and aims to regain the United States' leadership in manufacturing under their leadership.
