The article discusses the Trump administration's goal of making America great again through the promotion of "MAGAnomics," which aims for sustained 3% economic growth. The article argues that historically, a healthy American economy grew at around 3.5% but has since dropped to less than 2%. The author highlights the significant difference in household income between these growth rates and suggests that achieving 3% growth over the next 10 years would lead to a larger GDP, increased government revenues, and higher wages for American workers. The article acknowledges criticism of this goal but draws parallels to the Reagan era, where similar doubts were overcome, resulting in a period of strong economic growth. The focus of MAGAnomics is to grow the economy and provide wealth and opportunity for all Americans. The article emphasizes that America's greatness comes from its people, not from government intervention, and concludes that if the president's agenda is enacted, it will lead to the greatest revival of the American economy since the early 1980s.
