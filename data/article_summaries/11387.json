President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Oklahoma and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms and tornadoes struck the area starting on May 18, 2013. Federal funding will be available to individuals and businesses in the affected counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. State and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, can also receive federal funding for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is coordinating federal recovery operations, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated as damage assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The FEMA news desk can be contacted for further information.
