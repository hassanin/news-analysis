Heart disease continues to be a leading cause of death in the United States, affecting Americans of all genders, races, and ethnicities. However, it is also one of the most preventable diseases. During American Heart Month, the focus is on promoting better health, wellness, and prevention awareness in communities. Risk factors for heart disease include high cholesterol, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, obesity, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. By adopting healthy habits such as avoiding tobacco, moderating alcohol consumption, making nutritious meal choices, and staying active, individuals can reduce their risk. It's crucial not to ignore early warning signs of heart disease, such as chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, and sudden dizziness. It's also important to note that symptoms of a heart attack can be different for men and women. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in death rates from heart attacks due to people delaying or not seeking care after experiencing symptoms. Access to quality, affordable healthcare is crucial in the prevention and treatment of heart disease. Racial disparities in cardiovascular health exist, with Black Americans having the highest death rate for heart disease. Increased awareness and access to care are necessary to address these disparities. National Wear Red Day on February 5th raises awareness about heart disease prevention. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed February as American Heart Month and encourages all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day. The proclamation emphasizes the commitment to fight cardiovascular disease and build a healthier future for all.
