President Biden has proclaimed May 2023 as National Building Safety Month, emphasizing the importance of safe and resilient structures. While many buildings are safer today, a significant number of communities in America have yet to adopt the latest building codes, leaving them vulnerable to emerging threats like climate change. The Biden administration has taken steps to advance building codes, invest in infrastructure, combat climate change, and support code enforcement inspectors. The Inflation Reduction Act provides funding to help states and localities adopt energy-efficient building codes and improve indoor air quality. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has also assisted in rebuilding communities affected by natural disasters and incentivized the use of low-carbon materials. The administration is committed to directing 40% of the benefits from certain federal investments to disadvantaged communities. Additionally, President Biden encourages individuals to take steps to keep their homes safe, such as changing smoke alarm batteries, checking appliances and systems, and addressing mold and pest issues. The proclamation calls on citizens, government agencies, businesses, nonprofits, and other groups to raise awareness about building safety and contribute to building safety efforts.
