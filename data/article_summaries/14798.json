In this article, President Obama criticizes Republican leaders in Congress for blocking solutions to the Citizens United ruling. The President argues that after the Supreme Court overturned decades of laws and precedents in the Citizens United ruling, the executive branch tried to close these new legal loopholes with a common-sense law. This law would require public disclosure of who pays for political advertisements and restrict foreign-controlled corporations from spending to influence elections. However, Republican leaders have prevented the law from being voted on in the Senate, hoping that special interests will reward them by funding ads to attack their opponents. The President emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in political advertising, stating that voters should know who is behind these ads and what their motivations are. He also warns about the danger of foreign companies influencing American elections. The President argues that it is the responsibility of Congress to act, but acknowledges that any law passed will come too late to prevent the damage already done in this election season. He urges the public to question who is paying for negative advertisements and emphasizes that the power to determine the fate of the country lies with the people. The President concludes by stating that defending the fundamental American principle of government by the people is at stake in this election.
