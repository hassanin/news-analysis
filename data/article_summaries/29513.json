President Donald J. Trump has signed into law the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017, renewing the authority of the United States to collect foreign intelligence under section 702 of FISA. The Act allows for the sharing of information to prevent terrorist attacks and cyber crimes. It also strengthens protections for Americans against government abuse and enhances existing privacy protections. The reauthorization was achieved with bipartisan support, recognizing the importance of FISA section 702 in producing foreign intelligence that protects the country from foreign threats. The intelligence produced under this authority is crucial in keeping the nation safe from foreign terrorist networks and other foreign actors. Congress is acknowledged for their support in reauthorizing these authorities.
