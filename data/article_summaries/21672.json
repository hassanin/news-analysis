The Obama Administration has released the initial installment of the Quadrennial Energy Review (QER), which focuses on modernizing the nation's energy infrastructure. The report identifies opportunities for a clean and secure energy future, as well as vulnerabilities in the current systems. The report also proposes policy recommendations and investments to replace, protect, expand, and modernize energy transmission, storage, and distribution (TS&D) infrastructure. The Administration is also unveiling two executive actions to enhance the resilience of the electric grid. Additionally, the QER addresses the need to mitigate climate change, improve energy security, address cyber and physical threats, and support a 21st-century economy. The report emphasizes the importance of public-private partnerships and coordination between federal, state, and local levels. It also highlights the potential for job creation in the energy sector. The QER recommends actions in various areas, including pipeline replacement, energy assurance plans, grid modernization, fuels diversity, shared energy transport systems, integration of North American energy markets, environmental aspects of energy infrastructure, and workforce training. The report also addresses the need for timely permitting decisions and public engagement in the siting process.
