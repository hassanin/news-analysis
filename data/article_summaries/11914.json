Senior administration officials held a conference call to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the new sanctions on Russia. The officials explained that the sanctions are being imposed on Russia for its actions in violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The sanctions target key sectors of the Russian economy, including the financial services, energy, and defense sectors. Specifically, the sanctions prohibit US persons from providing new financing to two major Russian banks (Gazprombank and VEB) and two Russian energy firms (Rosneft and Novatek). The officials emphasized that these actions are aimed at imposing costs on Russia for its actions in Ukraine and that they have been coordinated closely with European allies. They also noted that the sanctions will have a significant impact on the Russian economy, causing further outflows of capital and weakening growth prospects. The officials highlighted that the US business community understands the importance of a robust response to Russia’s actions and that the sanctions are not intended to disrupt energy flows to Europe. They also clarified that the sanctions do not amount to recognition of the self-proclaimed entities in Donetsk and Luhansk, but rather target individuals associated with their actions. Overall, the officials stressed that the US remains committed to supporting Ukraine and imposing costs on Russia until it respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
