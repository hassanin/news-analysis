In this statement, the President expresses his appreciation for the bravery and selflessness of the firefighters, police officers, and first responders who risked their lives during the September 11, 2001 attacks. He acknowledges that many of these individuals continue to suffer from health problems as a result of their service. The President supports the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which would provide medical monitoring and treatment for those affected by the World Trade Center disaster. He applauds the House for approving the bill and hopes that Congress will complete its consideration so he can sign it into law.
