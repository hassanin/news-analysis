On July 26, 2019, the President of the United States declared a national emergency in response to the situation in Mali. The declaration was made due to the threat posed to national security and foreign policy, including ceasefire violations, terrorist activities, drug trafficking, human rights abuses, hostage-taking, coup d'etats, the presence of foreign mercenaries, and attacks against civilians, security forces, and international security presences. The national emergency, initially declared in Executive Order 13882, is set to continue beyond July 26, 2022. The continuation of the national emergency was announced by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on July 22, 2022, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
