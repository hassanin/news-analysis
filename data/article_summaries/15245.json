The statement by Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Christina Romer, discusses the employment situation in March. The report shows signs of gradual labor market improvement, with payroll employment increasing by 162,000. After adjusting for temporary Census workers and the effects of February snowstorms, there is still an increase in underlying payroll employment. Revised estimates also show a small job gain in January and a smaller job loss in February compared to previous reports. The unemployment rate remained constant at 9.7%, reflecting proportional increases in the labor force and employment. However, more than eight million Americans have lost their jobs since the start of the recession, and sustained employment growth is needed to bring the rate down. While this is a positive report, it is important to be cautious as monthly employment numbers are volatile and subject to revision. Continued efforts are needed to generate steady job gains.
