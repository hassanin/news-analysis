In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims December 1, 2016, as World AIDS Day. He reflects on the progress made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, but emphasizes that there is still work to be done. He highlights the importance of testing, treatment, and education in saving and improving lives. The President acknowledges that certain groups, such as gay and bisexual men, transgender people, youth, black and Latino Americans, and people who inject drugs, are at a higher risk of HIV/AIDS. He mentions the efforts his administration has made, including encouraging treatment as prevention, expanding access to pre-exposure prophylaxis, and working towards a vaccine. He also mentions the Affordable Care Act, which ensures coverage for pre-existing conditions like HIV and provides access to quality health insurance plans. Globally, there are over 36 million people living with HIV/AIDS, with the majority residing in low- to middle-income countries. The United States is actively involved in shaping the global response to this epidemic and has invested over $70 billion in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR has supported over 11 million people on life-saving treatment and contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The President emphasizes the need for sustained commitment and collaboration from all sectors of society to achieve an AIDS-free future. He calls for support and compassion for those living with HIV/AIDS and urges everyone to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS.
