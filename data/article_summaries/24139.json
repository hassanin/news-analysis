The United States has been working to find a global solution to reduce the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are harmful greenhouse gases used in air conditioners and refrigeration. Nearly 200 countries, meeting in Rwanda, have adopted an ambitious plan to phase down the use of HFCs, which could avoid up to 0.5Â°C of warming by the end of the century. The plan also includes financing for countries in need to adopt new air conditioning and refrigeration technology. This agreement, along with other recent developments such as the Paris Agreement entering into force and a deal to limit international aviation emissions, demonstrates that countries can work together to combat climate change and leave a safer and more prosperous planet for future generations.
