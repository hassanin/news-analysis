During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced that President Biden is committed to having public health experts, like Dr. Fauci, lead communication with the American people about the pandemic. Dr. Fauci then provided an update on the state of the pandemic, highlighting that although there are signs of plateauing cases, the situation is still serious with over 400,000 deaths and a high rate of new infections. He also discussed the impact of COVID-19 variants, noting that some mutations may increase transmissibility and have potential effects on the efficacy of vaccines and treatments. However, he emphasized the importance of vaccination and continued public health measures to control the virus. Psaki also discussed the President's commitment to bipartisanship and his focus on addressing the four crises facing the country: the pandemic, the economy, climate change, and racial equity. She mentioned that the President is open to engaging with both Democrats and Republicans to find bipartisan solutions. Psaki also addressed questions about the timeline for passing a new COVID-19 relief package, the extension of the New START treaty with Russia, and the administration's plans for immigration reform.
