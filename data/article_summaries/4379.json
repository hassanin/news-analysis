President Joe Biden has opened the first-ever Summit for Democracy, a forum for global leaders to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing democracies in the 21st century. As part of this commitment, President Biden has announced the establishment of the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal, which includes a set of policy and foreign assistance initiatives to bolster democracy and defend human rights worldwide. The United States believes that strengthening democracy and promoting human rights is not only the right thing to do, but also in its national security interest, as strong democracies are more peaceful, prosperous, and stable. The Presidential Initiative will focus on supporting free and independent media, fighting corruption, bolstering democratic reformers, advancing technology for democracy, and defending free and fair elections and political processes. The United States plans to allocate up to $424.4 million towards this initiative, subject to the availability of appropriations. Additionally, the U.S. Government will launch two new rapid response programs to support the objectives of the Summit for Democracy.
