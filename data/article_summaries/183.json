The White House has released a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Rural Playbook aimed at helping rural communities access funding under the historic investments in the nation's infrastructure. The Playbook provides information on how to apply for funding and identifies over 100 programs funded under the law. In addition, the Biden Administration will embark on a rural infrastructure tour in April, visiting rural communities to discuss the impact of the investments. The administration is committed to ensuring that federal resources reach all communities in rural America and is focused on providing high-speed internet, safe roads and bridges, modern wastewater systems, clean drinking water, reliable and affordable electricity, and good-paying jobs. The administration will also announce billions of dollars for rural areas, including funding for water projects, flood mitigation, transportation, healthcare, and tribal community grants. The Department of the Interior has already announced $420 million for rural water systems across six states. The President is also launching a $1 billion America the Beautiful Challenge to accelerate land, water, and wildlife conservation efforts. Since the signing of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Biden-Harris Administration has made significant progress in implementing the investment, with over $100 billion allocated to states for various infrastructure projects.
