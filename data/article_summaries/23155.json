The article is a statement by President Obama on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The President emphasizes the importance of trade in growing the economy and strengthening the middle class. He believes in leveling the playing field for American workers and businesses, allowing them to export more products and create higher-paying jobs. The President mentions that Democrats and Republicans in Congress have come together to negotiate agreements for free and fair trade. He argues that the United States should write the rules of the global economy, rather than letting countries like China do so. The President highlights that the TPP agreement reached in Atlanta will benefit American farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers by eliminating taxes on their products. He also states that the TPP includes strong commitments on labor and the environment, which are enforceable. The agreement promotes a free and open internet and strengthens strategic relationships with partners and allies in the region. The President assures that Congress and the American people will have time to review the agreement before he signs it, and he looks forward to working with lawmakers from both parties in considering it. The goal is to help American businesses sell more products and services worldwide and enable American workers to compete and succeed.
