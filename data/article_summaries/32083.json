On June 26, 2001, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans due to the threat posed by extremist violence and obstructionist activity in the region. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The President subsequently amended the order in 2003 to address acts obstructing the Ohrid Framework Agreement relating to Macedonia. The national emergency was set to expire on June 26, 2018, but President Trump has decided to continue it for another year. This decision is based on the belief that the actions of individuals in the Western Balkans continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The notice of the extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
