President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation recognizing the importance of apprenticeships in the United States. He highlights the booming economy and the need for workers with world-class skills to fill vacant positions. Trump emphasizes his administration's commitment to expanding apprenticeship opportunities, noting that American employers have hired over 400,000 apprentices since he took office. He also mentions the $145 million committed in 2018 to diversify and scale apprenticeship programs, as well as the additional $150 million in grant opportunities. Trump created the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion to identify proposals for cultivating apprenticeships across all sectors of the economy. He also mentions advancing tax and regulatory policies that increase opportunities for all Americans. Trump encourages participants in the economy to join efforts to expand apprenticeship programs, in order to build and educate the nation's workforce and secure economic greatness for future generations. As a result, he proclaims November 12 through November 18, 2018, as National Apprenticeship Week.
