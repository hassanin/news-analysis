The White House Press Secretary, Ben Rhodes, along with Tom Donohue, CEO of the United States Chamber of Commerce, and Andrew Liveris, CEO of Dow, held a press briefing at the Hannover Messe Fairgrounds in Germany. They discussed the importance of the transatlantic relationship and the need to strengthen the U.S. business community's participation in trade agreements like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). They also mentioned the dinner the previous night with Chancellor Merkel and other business leaders, where they discussed the business climate and opportunities for expanding business between the U.S. and EU. Rhodes announced that President Obama has decided to send an additional 250 U.S. Special Forces to Syria to support local forces fighting against ISIS. He emphasized that the U.S. is not engaging in combat operations in Syria, but rather providing support and advice to local forces. Rhodes also mentioned that the President will give a speech later in the day discussing the importance of collective multilateral action in addressing global challenges, and the need for allies to commit more to the fight against ISIS.
