Vice President Kamala Harris has called upon the private sector to increase investments in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. She met with the leaders of twelve businesses and organizations to discuss strategies and ideas for supporting families and small businesses in the region and removing obstacles to investment. Each of the twelve participants has made commitments to promote inclusive economic development in the Northern Triangle and encourage other private sector entities to do the same. This initiative aligns with the Biden-Harris Administration's strategy to utilize private sector commitments in order to foster economic growth and opportunity, as well as improve governance, combat corruption, and enhance security. The ultimate goal is to provide people in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras with hope and opportunities within their own countries.
