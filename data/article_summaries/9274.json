The Fifth Circuit's decision in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA is strongly disagreed with as it imposes unnecessary barriers to safe and effective FDA-approved medication. However, mifepristone remains accessible due to a stay from the Supreme Court. The lawsuit is seen as a threat to women's freedom to make decisions about their own bodies and is seen as a step towards a nationwide abortion ban. The decision is criticized for undermining the independent judgment of the FDA and for coming between doctors and their patients. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to protect access to abortion and defend the FDA in court to safeguard women's right to make decisions about their own healthcare.
