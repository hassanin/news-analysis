President Joseph R. Biden has proclaimed May 19, 2023, as National Hepatitis Testing Day in the United States. The article emphasizes the importance of testing and treatment for viral hepatitis, a hidden epidemic that causes serious liver diseases and can lead to death if left untreated. Hepatitis C is the most common strain and often goes undetected for years, spreading the virus and delaying treatment. The article highlights that viral hepatitis disproportionately affects Black Americans, Native Americans, the homeless, and incarcerated individuals. However, there is hope, as there is now a 95% effective cure for hepatitis C. President Biden's new budget includes a plan to end hepatitis C as a public health threat by expanding testing, reducing the cost of treatment, and promoting awareness. The plan aims to simplify and accelerate testing, pioneer innovative treatment approaches, support public health groups, train more healthcare professionals, expand testing and care sites, and work towards a hepatitis C vaccine. Additionally, steps are being taken to prevent hepatitis B, the second most common strain, by promoting screening and vaccination, particularly among Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities. The article concludes by urging all Americans to get tested for hepatitis B and C, get vaccinated for hepatitis B, and support the government's efforts to eliminate viral hepatitis from the country.
