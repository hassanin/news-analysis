President Obama intends to nominate U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch to be the next Attorney General of the United States. The announcement will be made in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, with current Attorney General Eric Holder and Lynch in attendance. Lynch is a highly regarded prosecutor and has previously served as the head of a prominent U.S. Attorney's Office. If confirmed, she will succeed Holder, who has made significant advancements in criminal justice reform and civil rights enforcement during his tenure.
