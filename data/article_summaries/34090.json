The United States condemns North Korea's recent test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, viewing it as a reckless and dangerous action. The US rejects North Korea's claim that these tests and weapons ensure its security, stating that they actually have the opposite effect. By threatening the world, these weapons and tests isolate North Korea, weaken its economy, and deprive its people. The US is committed to taking all necessary steps to protect its homeland and allies in the region.
