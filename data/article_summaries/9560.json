The article is a transcript of a press call conducted by Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, White House Coordinator Rob Malley, and Special Envoy Frank Lowenstein. The call was held to provide context and answer questions regarding the U.N. Security Council Resolution on Israeli Settlement Activity. Rhodes explains that the decision to abstain from the vote was made after considering the accelerating trend of Israeli settlement activity and the risk it posed to the two-state solution. He also emphasizes that the decision is consistent with longstanding bipartisan U.S. policy and reflects the U.S.'s opposition to settlements and support for a two-state solution. Rhodes addresses criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, stating that there is only one president at a time and that the decision was made based on U.S. policy, not in response to Trump's positions. He also refutes the notion that the resolution was initiated by the U.S., stating that it was put forward by the Egyptians and the Palestinians. Rhodes further explains that the resolution is a statement of the international community's view and does not have the power to stop Israeli settlements. Finally, Rhodes mentions that Secretary of State John Kerry will be providing a comprehensive vision for future negotiations in an upcoming speech.
