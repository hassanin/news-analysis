Vice President Kamala Harris met with the National Black Caucus of State Legislators to discuss important topics. She expressed gratitude to President Billy Mitchell and President-Elect Laura Hall for their leadership. Harris addressed two key issues: Ukraine and the Supreme Court. Regarding Ukraine, she emphasized that the U.S. has imposed significant costs on Russia for its invasion and will continue to work with allies and partners. If Russia escalates, more costs will be imposed. On the Supreme Court, Harris announced that President Biden will soon nominate a highly qualified Black woman as the next justice. She also discussed the importance of preserving voting rights and fighting against legislation that seeks to restrict voting access. Harris mentioned the need for federal legislation, but acknowledged the importance of state-level efforts. She shared a saying from Reverend Jerry Young: "No vote, no voice, your choice." Harris thanked the National Black Caucus for their work and expressed her commitment to continuing their collaboration.
