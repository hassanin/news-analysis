Vice President Biden delivered a report to President Obama on the progress of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the Recovery Act. The report states that the funds from the Recovery Act have been used as planned, with projects often coming in under budget and a low rate of waste and fraud. The administration had set a goal to spend 70% of the funds by September 30, 2010, and the report confirms that this goal was met. In addition, all spending deadlines were met on time or ahead of schedule. The report also highlights cost savings on projects, which allowed for the funding of over 3,000 additional job-creating projects. The report concludes that there is strong oversight, with less than 0.2% of reported awards currently under active fraud investigations. The full report can be viewed online.
