In this excerpt from his State of the Union Address, President Obama emphasizes the need for action and progress in the coming months. He highlights the belief in opportunity for all as a unifying factor among Americans, but acknowledges that this belief has been challenged over the years due to technological advancements and global competition. The President mentions that while corporate profits and stock prices have risen, average wages have barely increased, inequality has deepened, and upward mobility has stalled. He proposes concrete and practical solutions to address these issues, some of which require Congressional action. However, he also states his willingness to take steps without legislation to expand opportunities for American families. The President concludes by emphasizing that opportunity is a defining aspect of the nation and that restoring that promise is the defining project of their generation.
