On September 10, 2009, the White House released a notice from President Barack Obama regarding the continuation of the national emergency declared in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The national emergency, originally declared on September 14, 2001, is being extended for another year due to the ongoing terrorist threat and the need to maintain the powers and authorities necessary to address the emergency. The notice states that the terrorist threat is still present and that the national emergency must continue beyond September 14, 2009. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
