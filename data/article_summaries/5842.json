In a meeting at the Vice President's ceremonial office, leaders discuss the issue of voting rights in America, with a particular focus on voting rights for people with disabilities. The Vice President acknowledges that voting rights for people with disabilities are a priority and seeks insight and advice from the leaders on how emerging laws in various states will impact this community. She also recognizes that even before these laws emerged, there were existing challenges in ensuring voting rights for people with disabilities.

The discussion revolves around the impact of laws restricting or preventing vote-by-mail and early voting on different communities, including those who work multiple jobs. The Vice President emphasizes the importance of considering how these restrictions will affect people's ability to have their voices heard through their vote. The leaders also address laws that impede assistance for individuals to register their vote, highlighting concerns about the suppression of people's voices.

The Vice President mentions that the administration's executive order from March aims to improve accessibility in voting. This includes requiring federal websites to provide more voting information in accessible language and making the federal voter registration form more user-friendly. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will also study barriers to voting for people with disabilities and provide recommendations.

Additionally, the Vice President announces that they have issued a notice asking for input from people with disabilities, which must be submitted by the end of Friday, July 16th. She directs people to visit www.regulations.gov to provide their input.

When asked about her conversation with Texas legislators, the Vice President praises their courageous actions and commitment to fighting for Americans' right to vote unencumbered.
