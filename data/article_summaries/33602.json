In the first nine months of the Trump administration, President Trump has taken steps to improve the American economy by reducing regulations, promoting American energy, and prioritizing working families in trade policy. These efforts have resulted in over 1 million new jobs, a 17-year low in unemployment, and an economic growth rate of over 3 percent. However, President Trump believes that more needs to be done, and is working to pass the largest tax cut in American history before the end of the year. The tax cut plan is based on four principles: giving working families a historic tax cut, simplifying and making the tax code fair, making American businesses competitive by cutting the business tax rate, and cutting taxes on money held overseas to encourage investment in the US. The goal is to put more money in working Americans' pockets, support job creators, and prioritize America's interests. The tax cut plan is expected to give the average American household an extra $4,000 per year. The administration believes that cutting taxes will lead to more jobs, higher wages, and an economy where anyone can achieve the American dream. The President and Vice President are committed to passing the tax cut plan this year.
