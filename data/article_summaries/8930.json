President Joseph R. Biden has proclaimed May 15 through May 21, 2022, as National Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Week in the United States. The theme for this year's EMS Week is "Rising to the Challenge," recognizing the heroic efforts of EMS providers who put the needs of their communities first. EMS workers have been essential during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing immediate medical attention and care. The proclamation acknowledges the sacrifices made by EMS providers, including their physical well-being, mental health, and time with loved ones. The American Rescue Plan includes funding to support EMS workers, and efforts are being made to ensure that state, local, tribal, and territorial partners have the necessary resources to train and equip EMS providers. The proclamation calls for appreciation and honor for EMS professionals, as well as paying tribute to those who have lost their lives in the line of duty.
