The White House remains committed to the ceasefire in Syria, despite reports of violations. The ceasefire is important for delivering humanitarian aid, focusing on defeating ISIS, and working towards a political solution in Syria. The responsibility for the violations has not been determined yet. The White House is closely monitoring the situation. The President believes it is important to protect the privacy and civil liberties of Americans while also preventing terrorists from using cyberspace as a safe haven. The President's investigation into the San Bernardino shooting is a priority in order to protect the American people. The White House is hopeful for a political solution in Syria and is working with international partners to impose sanctions on North Korea. The President is committed to fulfilling his constitutional responsibility to nominate a Supreme Court justice, and hopes that Republicans will fulfill their constitutional responsibility to consider the nominee. The President believes that the Supreme Court should be fully staffed in order to function properly. The White House is closely monitoring the Iranian elections and expects official results to be released soon. The President's diplomatic engagement with Iran is not dependent on the outcome of the elections. The White House has not reached the goal of welcoming 25,000 Syrian refugees into the U.S. yet. The process for admitting refugees is rigorous and can take 18 to 24 months. The President believes that the U.S. and Canada have a strong national security relationship and that the U.S. should continue to play a leading role in responding to international crises while also protecting national security. The President will use his constitutional authority to nominate a qualified Supreme Court justice, and hopes that Republicans will fulfill their constitutional responsibility to consider the nominee. The decision on whether to label ISIS' actions as genocide will be made by the State Department.
