President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued a proclamation declaring May 22, 2022, as National Maritime Day in the United States. The proclamation recognizes the important role of the United States Merchant Marine in the nation's prosperity, economic security, and defense. The Merchant Marine is responsible for moving goods throughout the supply chain and supporting military operations. The proclamation also acknowledges the efforts of mariners during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they risked their lives to deliver essential medical supplies and equipment. President Biden reaffirms his administration's support for the Merchant Marine and the Jones Act, which protects the domestic maritime industry and contributes to economic benefits. The proclamation emphasizes the need for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the industry and the commitment to address issues like sexual assault, sexual harassment, and bullying in the workplace. National Maritime Day commemorates the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship in 1819 and calls upon all Americans to celebrate the Merchant Marine and maritime industry through appropriate programs and activities.
