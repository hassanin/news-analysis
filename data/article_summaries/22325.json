The article discusses the need for sustained action and ambition on nuclear security after the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit. The governments of various countries, along with international organizations like INTERPOL and the United Nations, commit to establishing a Nuclear Security Contact Group. This group will convene annually to discuss nuclear security-related issues, promote and assess implementation of nuclear security commitments, and determine any additional steps that may be necessary. The Contact Group may also consider and make recommendations on convening future Nuclear Security Summits. All countries that support the goals outlined in the Joint Statement are invited to participate in the Contact Group.
