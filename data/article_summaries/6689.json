In this letter, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. addresses the Speaker of the House, representatives, senators, and the chairman regarding the report on securing the nation's critical infrastructure. The report, in compliance with the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, assesses the current framework for securing critical infrastructure and provides recommendations. The President reviewed the report and found no critical concerns, acknowledging the feedback incorporated from various sources. The President emphasizes the need to implement the Secretary of Homeland Security's recommendations across the federal government and plans to revise the United States policy for critical infrastructure. The updated policy aims to address digitalization, automation, adversary threats, and climate change, while strengthening the public-private partnership and clarifying roles and responsibilities. The President accepts the Secretary's recommendations and will work closely with relevant agencies and the private sector to oversee their implementation. The President also highlights the urgency to improve the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, as current approaches lack comprehensive mandatory minimum requirements. The administration looks forward to collaborating with Congress to address these gaps in statutory authorities. Finally, the President expresses commitment to working with Congress to ensure secure and resilient infrastructure, promote job creation, support small businesses, and invest in the future.
