Today, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese held a meeting with semiconductor industry participants to discuss progress made in addressing supply chain challenges and increasing transparency. The industry has improved communication and trust across the supply chain and implemented better supply chain practices. The administration emphasized that the industry should take the lead in resolving the global chip shortage and reaffirmed its commitment to transparency initiatives. The participants acknowledged the impact of the pandemic on the shortage and appreciated the administration's efforts to support the safe reopening of factories. The administration announced the formalization of an early alert system, managed by the Department of Commerce and the State Department, to proactively address potential disruptions linked to public health developments in key trading partners. The goals include early detection of disruptions, engagement with foreign governments and industry, and supply chain transparency. The Commerce Department also launched a Request for Information to gather information about inventories, demand, and delivery dynamics from all parts of the supply chain. Secretary Raimondo urged business leaders to respond to the RFI to improve trust and transparency. Congress is urged to take action to build domestic chip manufacturing capacity and establish a supply chain resiliency program at the Commerce Department for monitoring vulnerabilities and taking necessary actions.
