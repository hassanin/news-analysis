The United States and Sweden have successfully removed plutonium from Sweden as part of a collaboration on nonproliferation. This was the first shipment of plutonium to the United States under the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) program. The project began in 2009 and was completed in 2012, with over 3 kilograms of plutonium being removed from the AB SVAFO facility in Studsvik. The plutonium was securely stored under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards prior to removal. The process involved obtaining environmental approvals, designing and constructing a plutonium laboratory in Sweden, packaging the material in accordance with IAEA safeguards, and validating a package certificate for international shipment. The material will be disposed of along with U.S. surplus plutonium using existing disposition paths. Handling plutonium presents unique challenges due to its radioactivity and pyrophoricity, and special precautions and equipment are required for its stabilization, packaging, and shipment.
