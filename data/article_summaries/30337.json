President Trump held a press conference in the Roosevelt Room to announce an executive order that will open up offshore areas for energy exploration. He stated that the federal government has kept 94% of offshore areas closed for exploration and production, which has deprived the country of potential jobs and wealth. The executive order will reverse the previous administration's Arctic leasing ban and direct Secretary Zinke to allow responsible development of offshore areas. The order also aims to reduce burdensome regulations that hinder job creation and enable better scientific study of offshore resources. President Trump believes that this action will lead to greater energy independence, lower energy costs, and more job opportunities for Americans. He thanked Vice President Pence, Secretaries Ross and Zinke, and the people who worked on the executive order. President Trump also mentioned that his administration has accomplished a lot in the first 100 days.
