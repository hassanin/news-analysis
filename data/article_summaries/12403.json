The White House Press Secretary released a statement in July 2010, expressing support for the House of Representatives' decision to extend unemployment benefits for Americans. The statement criticized the Republican leadership in the Senate for obstructing this aid and accused them of playing politics. It emphasized that the obstruction not only jeopardized the livelihoods of American families but also hindered the economic recovery by cutting off an important source of revenue. The President's top economic priority was getting people back to work, and the statement called for more action, including passing aid for state and local governments, tax cuts for businesses, and stimulating private sector job growth. The President would continue to push Congress to prioritize jobs legislation during this critical time for the economy.
