President Joseph R. Biden has granted permission to the General Services Administration to expand and maintain a vehicular and pedestrian crossing at the Calexico East Land Port of Entry to Mexico. The permit allows for the construction of additional lanes and requires compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The permittee is responsible for mitigating adverse impacts on the environment and obtaining necessary permits and authorizations. The permit can be amended or revoked by the President and will expire in 10 years if construction has not commenced. The permit does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
