President Biden has declared a major disaster in California due to severe winter storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred since December 27, 2022. This declaration allows for federal funding to supplement recovery efforts in affected areas. Assistance includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid individuals and business owners. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Andrew F. Grant has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Damage assessments are still ongoing, and additional areas may be designated for assistance. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance online, by phone, or through the FEMA App. Further information can be obtained from the FEMA News Desk.
