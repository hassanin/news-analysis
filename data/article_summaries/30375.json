A new Harvard-Harris Poll found that a majority of American voters agree with President Donald Trump's immigration priorities. The poll, which was representative of the U.S. population, showed that 65% of voters overall agreed with Trump's position on codifying Obama-era protections for illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. These voters believe that any bill should be accompanied by funding for a wall, ending chain migration, and ending the diversity visa lottery program. Additionally, 79% of respondents believed that immigration priority should be based on a person's ability to contribute to America through education and skills or having relatives in the U.S.
