President Obama has announced that he will visit the Gulf Coast in mid-October to assess the progress in the region's recovery from Hurricane Katrina and Rita. He has also signed an executive order extending the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Recovery and Rebuilding for six months. The Obama Administration has been working to provide assistance to Gulf Coast residents by cutting through bureaucratic red tape and improving coordination among federal agencies, resulting in over $1 billion in public assistance projects being obligated since the start of the Administration. The Recovery Act is also providing significant resources to the region, supporting communities and individuals and creating and saving jobs. Additionally, President Obama is taking steps to improve disaster recovery efforts nationwide by examining lessons learned from previous disasters and reviewing federal disaster recovery programs. More details on President Obama's trip will be released at a later time.
