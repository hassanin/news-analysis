President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued a memorandum to the Secretary of Energy regarding a Presidential Determination pursuant to Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of ensuring a strong domestic industrial base to support the clean energy economy, national security, and the preservation of critical infrastructure. President Biden determines that transformers and electric power grid components are essential to national defense and that the United States industry cannot provide these resources in a timely manner without Presidential action. Therefore, he authorizes purchases, purchase commitments, or other actions under Section 303 of the Act as the most effective and practical means to meet the need. Additionally, President Biden finds that expanding domestic production capability for transformers and power grid components is necessary to prevent a shortfall that could significantly impair national defense capability. Consequently, he waives certain requirements of the Act to facilitate this expansion. The memorandum concludes by instructing the Secretary of Energy to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
