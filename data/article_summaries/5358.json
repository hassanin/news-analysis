National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan gave a readout of the Quad meeting that took place, in which the leaders of the United States, Japan, Australia, and India gathered virtually to discuss key regional issues. The leaders addressed issues such as freedom of navigation in the South and East China Seas, the DPRK nuclear issue, and the coup in Burma. They also discussed the competition between autocracy and democracy and expressed their confidence in the power of democracy to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The leaders made a joint commitment to deliver up to 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the Indo-Pacific region by the end of 2022. They also agreed to meet in person before the end of the year and launched working groups on emerging technologies and cyber threats. The Quad is now seen as a critical part of the Indo-Pacific architecture, and the summit marks a big day for American diplomacy. Additionally, Sullivan mentioned upcoming high-level meetings and visits in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as the upcoming meeting with senior Chinese officials in Alaska. The administration is entering the meeting with a position of strength, having made progress on various fronts, such as economic growth, COVID-19 vaccinations, critical supply chain security, and revitalized alliances.
