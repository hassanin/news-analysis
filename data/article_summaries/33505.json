The article discusses an executive order issued by President Donald J. Trump regarding the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its jurisdiction over personnel of the United States and its allies. The order states that the ICC's investigation into actions allegedly committed by US military, intelligence, and other personnel in Afghanistan threatens to subject US officials to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest. It also claims that the ICC's actions infringe upon US sovereignty and impede national security and foreign policy work. The order seeks to impose consequences on those responsible for the ICC's actions, including the suspension of entry into the US for ICC officials, employees, and their immediate family members. The order declares a national emergency to deal with this perceived threat and blocks the property and interests in property of foreign persons involved in ICC investigations without US consent. It also prohibits certain transactions and donations to these individuals. The order suspends the entry of aliens determined to meet certain criteria, unless it is determined to be in the interests of the US. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to take necessary actions to implement the order, and reports on the national emergency are to be submitted to Congress. The order does not affect the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and it is subject to applicable law and appropriations.
