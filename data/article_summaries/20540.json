Vice President Joe Biden announced the availability of grants worth nearly $1.2 billion to help hospitals and healthcare providers implement and use electronic health records (EHRs). These grants, funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, aim to help healthcare providers qualify for new incentives that will be available in 2010 for meaningful use of EHRs. The grants include funding for Health Information Technology Regional Extension Centers, which will provide technical assistance to hospitals and clinicians in adopting EHR systems, and for states and designated entities to support the development of information sharing mechanisms within a nationwide network. The Department of Health and Human Services will also provide additional assistance through the Health Information Technology Research Center to gather and share best practices in EHR adoption and use. These initiatives are part of the efforts to create a national, private, and secure electronic health information system.
