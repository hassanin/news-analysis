This article is about President Joe Biden's executive order to establish an Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families at the United States-Mexico border. The order aims to reunite children who were separated from their families between January 20, 2017, and January 20, 2021, due to the Zero-Tolerance Policy. The Task Force will be chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security and will include members from various government departments. Its functions include identifying separated children, facilitating reunification, providing recommendations, and reporting progress to the President. The Task Force will coordinate with stakeholders and terminate 30 days after providing its final report. The executive order also revokes a previous executive order related to family separation. The order emphasizes that it does not impair existing authority or create new rights.
