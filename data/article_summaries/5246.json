President Joe Biden has proclaimed November 15, 2021, as America Recycles Day. In his statement, he highlights the devastating toll of climate change on communities across the country and emphasizes the need to take action. He states that reducing, reusing, and recycling can help decrease waste and greenhouse gas emissions while protecting the environment. The President acknowledges that although progress has been made, there is still work to be done, particularly in addressing the disproportionate impact of pollution and mismanaged waste on marginalized communities. To improve the national recycling system, the Biden Administration is releasing a National Recycling Strategy that outlines objectives and actions to fight climate change and create a sustainable system. The strategy aims to increase access to recycling and ensure equitable waste management. The President calls for collaboration between the government, private sector, and individuals to reshape the recycling system and protect the environment. He encourages Americans to visit www.epa.gov/recycle for more information on reducing, reusing, and recycling. President Biden concludes by reaffirming the commitment to creating a more sustainable future for future generations.
