Second Lady Karen Pence hosted a breakfast for the Military Family Advisory Network (MFAN) to celebrate their fifth anniversary and annual summit. During the breakfast, Mrs. Pence expressed support for MFAN's work in addressing challenges faced by military families, such as employment, education, and frequent moves. The MFAN Solutions Summit will discuss the primary challenges identified in their 2017 survey, including health care coverage, employment, childcare, education, food security, and the effects of frequent moves. MFAN has recommended prioritizing health care, community involvement, and financial education for military families. Mrs. Pence has gained a better understanding of military life through her participation in roundtable discussions with military spouses.
