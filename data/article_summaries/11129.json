In this press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney discusses two main topics: the suspicious letters sent to President Obama and a United States senator, and the bombings in Boston. Carney states that the FBI is leading the investigation into the letters and that they are conducting further tests to determine the nature of the substance. He also emphasizes that it is important to allow the investigation in Boston to run its course and maintain its integrity. Carney mentions that the President has been regularly briefed on both issues and will be traveling to Boston to speak at an interfaith service. Regarding the gun control votes on Capitol Hill, Carney expresses the President's disappointment in the lack of support for passing the background checks bill, which has the support of 90% of the American people. He emphasizes the need to close loopholes in the background check system and hold responsible gun shop owners accountable. Carney also discusses the bipartisan immigration reform bill and states that while it is a compromise, it is largely consistent with the President's principles. He does not provide a definitive answer on whether the President would sign the bill as is, stating that bills of this size often undergo changes before reaching the President's desk.
