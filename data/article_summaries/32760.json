President Trump's economic policies have resulted in positive outcomes, including high confidence levels, low unemployment rates, and business expansion. Gallup's economic survey indicates that confidence in the economy is at a 14-year high, with only 13% of respondents considering it a problem. Additionally, 55% of respondents rate current economic conditions positively, and a record-tying 68% believe it is a good time to find a quality job. U.S. factory production has expanded for the fifth consecutive month, indicating a solid start to the fourth quarter. Small-business owners' confidence remains at near-record levels due to a strong labor market, high profit trends, and low inflation. Consumer sentiment is also on the rise, with the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index hitting 98.3 in November. The unemployment rate is at a record low in ten states, including California, New York, and Texas. The ratio of unemployed workers to available jobs is also at a record low, indicating a strong economy. In a tight job market, some employers are hiring candidates without meeting them in person, relying on phone interviews instead. The United Steelworkers union has secured a new agreement with U.S. Steel, which includes a 14% wage increase over four years and improved benefits.
