The article discusses President Obama's call for Congress to partner on government reform. The Obama Administration has sent Congress the Consolidating and Reforming Government Act of 2012, which would reinstate the authority for Presidents to reorganize and consolidate the Federal government. The proposal also includes a requirement that any reorganization plan must save money or reduce the size of government. President Obama emphasizes the need for a more efficient government that supports economic growth and job creation. He plans to consolidate and reform the Federal government to make it leaner, smarter, and more consumer-friendly. The President's first action would be to make it easier for businesses to access services for growth and export, saving taxpayers $3 billion. The Administration will work with stakeholders to develop a detailed reorganization proposal and eliminate duplication and excess overhead in other areas across the government.
