The White House has released an updated Strategy for American Innovation, which outlines the Administration's efforts to ensure that the US remains the world's most innovative economy. The strategy focuses on three core components: investing in research and development (R&D) and other building blocks of long-term economic growth, identifying strategic areas for focused effort, and making the Federal government more innovative. The Administration also highlights nine areas of strategic opportunity, including advanced manufacturing, precision medicine, smart cities, and clean energy. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of increasing the innovation capacity of the government through institutional change and experimentation.
