President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared in 1995, will continue beyond March 15, 2020. He has determined that the actions and policies of the Iranian government still pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, comprehensive sanctions against Iran will be maintained to address this threat.
