President Trump visited the North Las Vegas VA Medical Center to sign a government funding bill that will provide funding for the renovation of military bases and improve healthcare services for veterans. The bill also includes funding for opioid treatment and prevention, mental health care services, telemedicine, and electronic health records for veterans. The legislation also allocates funds to build and repair facilities on military bases and modernize the nuclear weapons security program. President Trump emphasized the importance of providing timely and quality care to veterans, and praised the VA Choice program that allows veterans to seek care from private doctors if they cannot receive timely care from the VA. The President also expressed his commitment to rebuilding and providing assistance to areas affected by Hurricane Florence in North and South Carolina.
