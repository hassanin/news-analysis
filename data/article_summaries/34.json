The Biden-Harris Administration has announced a historic agreement to work with Tribes and States in the Pacific Northwest to restore wild salmon populations, expand clean energy production, and provide stability for communities that rely on the Columbia River System. This agreement, combined with other anticipated funding, will bring over $1 billion in new Federal investments to wild fish restoration in the Columbia River Basin over the next decade and facilitate the development of at least one to three gigawatts of Tribally sponsored clean energy production. The agreement also includes a 10-year break from litigation against the Federal government's operation of dams in the Pacific Northwest. The Federal government aims to restore wild salmon and other native fish populations while safeguarding sustainable energy and water resources. The announcement builds on a previous agreement to support Tribally led efforts to bring back salmon populations in the Upper Columbia River Basin.
