President Biden delivered a speech at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, announcing a historic investment by Intel in semiconductor manufacturing in Ohio. The $20 billion investment will create 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full-time jobs. The President emphasized the importance of semiconductors, which power various everyday devices, and highlighted that the United States invented these chips. However, American manufacturing has declined over the years, with companies moving production overseas. As a result, the U.S. now produces only 10% of computer chips globally, and 75% of production occurs in East Asia. China, in particular, is aggressively competing to dominate the global market, including for military applications. The President emphasized the need to invest in American manufacturing, innovation, and workers to ensure economic competitiveness and national security. He called on Congress to pass the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, which includes funding for research and development, manufacturing, and supply chains. The President also highlighted the importance of infrastructure investments and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in attracting companies like Intel to invest in the United States. He stressed that the country has the most productive workers, the best research universities, and a strong intellectual property protection framework. The President concluded by expressing his confidence in America's potential to achieve anything if it acts together.
