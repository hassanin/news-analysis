The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced that the application for its Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program grants is now open. Approximately 150 grants totaling over $18.75 million will be awarded to new community-based coalitions addressing youth substance use. This funding is part of the $100 million allocated by Congress in FY 2019 to support ONDCP's prevention program, which includes over 500 existing DFC coalitions. The program aims to prevent youth substance use, including prescription drugs, marijuana, tobacco, and alcohol. The ONDCP Director, James Carroll, praised the program's success and emphasized the importance of investing in proven initiatives to help children make healthy choices. Youth living in DFCs consistently have lower substance use rates. The application for the grant program can be accessed through a provided link, and a map of DFCs across the country is also available.
