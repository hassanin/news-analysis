The American Rescue Plan is providing important tax relief to middle-class and struggling working families with children. Around 90% of families with children will receive this tax relief automatically, beginning in July. However, in order to ensure that working families can continue to rely on this relief in the future, Congress needs to pass the American Families Plan. This tax cut is a clear message to working families with children that help is available.
