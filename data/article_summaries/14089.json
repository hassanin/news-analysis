President Obama announced an important step forward in America's commitment to the Asia Pacific region and the future of human rights. He expressed concern about the denial of basic human rights in Burma, including the persecution of democratic reformers and ethnic minorities. However, he acknowledged the progress made in recent weeks, such as the dialogue between the government and Aung San Suu Kyi, the release of political prisoners, and the relaxation of media restrictions. President Obama emphasized the need for further reform in Burma's political system, treatment of minorities, and relationship with North Korea. He confirmed that Aung San Suu Kyi supports American engagement in the process and asked Secretary Hillary Clinton to travel to Burma to explore the possibility of a positive transition and a new chapter between the United States and Burma. President Obama stated that if Burma continues on the path of democratic reform, it can forge a new relationship with the United States, but if not, it will face sanctions and isolation. He reinforced these messages in a meeting with ASEAN and planned for Secretary Clinton to deliver the message to the Burmese government, civil society, and activists. President Obama highlighted the importance of pursuing a future of reconciliation and renewal for the Burmese people.
