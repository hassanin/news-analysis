The military's takeover in Burma, the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian officials, and the declaration of a national state of emergency are seen as a direct assault on the country's transition to democracy and the rule of law. This action goes against the will of the people and disregards the outcome of a credible election. The people of Burma have been working towards establishing elections, civilian governance, and peaceful power transfer for almost a decade, and this progress should be respected.

The international community is urged to unite and put pressure on the Burmese military to immediately relinquish power, release detained activists and officials, lift telecommunications restrictions, and refrain from violence against civilians. The United States is observing those who support the people of Burma during this difficult time and will collaborate with partners worldwide to restore democracy and the rule of law. Additionally, the United States will reevaluate its sanction laws and authorities in response to the reversal of democratic progress in Burma.

The United States will defend democracy wherever it is threatened.
