President Obama has named 213 mathematics and science teachers as recipients of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching. These teachers represent all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Territories, and Department of Defense Education Activity schools. The awardees will receive a $10,000 award from the National Science Foundation and will be honored at a ceremony in Washington, DC on September 8. The Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching recognizes outstanding K-12 science and mathematics teachers from across the country. The winners are selected by a panel of scientists, mathematicians, and educators. This award is part of President Obama's commitment to strengthen education in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The President's Educate to Innovate campaign has resulted in over $1 billion in private investment for improving K-12 STEM education, and the goal is to put 100,000 additional excellent STEM teachers in America's classrooms by 2021.
