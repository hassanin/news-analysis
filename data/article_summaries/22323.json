This article is a transcript of a press briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney and Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx. The main focus of the briefing is the critical need to invest in infrastructure in order to build the economy and create jobs. Secretary Foxx highlights the urgent need for Congress to act, as the Highway Trust Fund is expected to run out of money soon, which could result in delays and shutdowns of important infrastructure projects. He also mentions the deteriorating condition of roads and bridges across the country and the need for increased investment to meet the demands of a growing population and economy. Secretary Foxx discusses the administration's proposed GROW AMERICA Act, which aims to increase annual funding for infrastructure and streamline the permitting process. He expresses optimism that there is room for agreement on these ideas and emphasizes the importance of bipartisan support. The briefing also touches on other topics such as the transportation of crude oil by trains, the possibility of toll roads, and the need for comprehensive immigration reform.
