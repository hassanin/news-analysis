President Obama has declared a major disaster in Kentucky due to severe storms, flooding, mudslides, and tornadoes that occurred starting on May 1, 2010. This declaration allows for federal funding to supplement recovery efforts in affected areas. Assistance may include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs for individuals and business owners to recover from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and facility repairs/replacement in certain counties. Hazard mitigation measures for the entire state are also eligible for federal cost-sharing. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional counties may be designated for assistance. Residents and business owners in designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. Further information can be obtained from FEMA.
