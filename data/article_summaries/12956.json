President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Vermont, providing federal aid to help with recovery efforts following a severe winter storm that occurred in December 2014. The declaration allows for federal funding to be used for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures in certain counties. James N. Russo has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
