President Donald Trump has notified Congress of his intention to terminate the designation of Mauritania as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). This decision was made due to the Mauritanian government's failure to establish or make progress towards establishing the protection of internationally recognized worker rights. Specifically, Mauritania has not made sufficient progress in combating forced labor, including hereditary slavery. Despite engagement with the United States, the Mauritanian government has not met the required benchmarks to address these issues. The termination of Mauritania's designation will take effect from January 1, 2019. However, the government's progress will continue to be assessed, and there is potential for reinstatement of eligibility if they make continual progress towards establishing worker rights protection in accordance with AGOA eligibility requirements.
