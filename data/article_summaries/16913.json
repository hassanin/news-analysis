In a statement issued by Alan B. Krueger, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, it is stated that the employment report for March provides further evidence that the economy is recovering from the recession. The report shows that employer payrolls increased by 121,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate decreased to 8.2%. However, the household survey shows that employment was virtually unchanged. The construction industry continues to face challenges, with an unemployment rate of 17.2%. The statement highlights the need for investments in infrastructure to support the economy. Despite challenges, the economy has added private sector jobs for 25 consecutive months, totaling 4.1 million jobs. Manufacturing has been a bright spot, adding 37,000 jobs in March. Other sectors with job increases include leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, and financial activities. Retail trade, construction, and government experienced job losses. The statement emphasizes that monthly employment figures can be volatile and subject to revision, and should be considered in the context of other available data.
