President Biden has designated Gregory Goldstein as Acting Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) and is urging the Senate to confirm Javier Ramirez as the permanent FMCS Director. Goldstein has been the Chief Operating Officer for FMCS since 2018, while Ramirez has been with FMCS since 2005 and currently serves as the Executive Manager of the Division of Agency Initiatives. The President believes that with the recovery of the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic and the increased power of workers in collective bargaining, the FMCS plays a crucial role in facilitating productive relationships between unions and employers. The appointment of Goldstein and the potential confirmation of Ramirez are expected to enhance the FMCS's ability to assist in successful negotiations, including during ongoing strikes or lockouts.
