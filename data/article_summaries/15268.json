A report by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) calls for renewed focus on basic research in the United States to sustain innovation and create jobs. The report highlights that America's global leadership in science and technology is being threatened due to global economic trends and a corporate emphasis on short-term results. If the challenges to basic and early-applied research are not addressed, there is a risk of losing not just jobs but entire new industries. The report recommends strategic investments in universities and national laboratories as hubs of innovation and economic growth. It suggests increasing the total R&D expenditures to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) and developing policy incentives to enhance private industry investment. Other recommendations include increasing stability and predictability of federal research funding, making the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit permanent, improving undergraduate STEM education, and attracting and retaining the world's best researchers and students from abroad. PCAST is an advisory group that provides policy recommendations on science, technology, and innovation to the President and the Executive Office of the President.
