Mark Frerichs, a U.S. Navy veteran and civil engineer, has been held hostage by the Taliban in Afghanistan for two years. Despite being innocent and having helped the people of Afghanistan for a decade, he remains captive. The Taliban's actions are condemned as cruel and cowardly, and they are urged to release Mark immediately. The safety of Americans and innocent civilians is non-negotiable, and the Taliban cannot expect any consideration until they release Mark. The U.S. administration is committed to working tirelessly until every American wrongfully detained overseas is brought back home.
