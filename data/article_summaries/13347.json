First Lady Michelle Obama has launched the "Chefs Move to Schools" program as part of her Let's Move! campaign to combat childhood obesity. The program aims to involve chefs in adopting schools and working with teachers, parents, nutritionists, and administrators to educate children about food and nutrition. Through this program, chefs will create healthy and appealing meals that meet the schools' dietary guidelines and budgets. With millions of children participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, the importance of good nutrition in schools is emphasized. Chefs and nutrition experts are seen as valuable partners in addressing the childhood obesity crisis, and their involvement can help improve the overall health and nutrition of America's children. Chefs interested in participating can sign up on the Let's Move! website.
