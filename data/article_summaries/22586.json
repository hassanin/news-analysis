This article discusses the bold investments made by the Obama administration in the auto industry and the city of Detroit, which have helped put Americans back to work and strengthen the economy. When President Obama took office, the American auto industry was in crisis, with GM and Chrysler on the verge of failure. However, through government assistance and demanding real change, the auto industry not only avoided collapse but bounced back stronger than ever. Since 2009, the auto industry has added over 646,000 jobs, manufacturing has created nearly 900,000 new jobs, and American auto production has doubled. The article also highlights the federal support provided to Detroit, including efforts to eliminate blight, improve lighting, support workforce training, enhance public transportation, invest in green infrastructure, spur manufacturing, and strengthen economic development. The Federal-Detroit partnership will continue in 2016 to address the city's priorities.
