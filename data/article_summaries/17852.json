The Equal Futures Partnership was launched in 2012 by the United States to encourage governments worldwide to address barriers to women's economic and political participation. The partnership has grown from 11 governments to 27 countries and the European Union, along with private sector, non-profit, and multilateral partners. Equal Futures partner countries commit to implementing legal, regulatory, and policy reforms to ensure women's full participation in public life and inclusive economic growth. Each participant works with stakeholders to identify priorities, set goals, exchange best practices, and report progress. In 2015, a new governance structure was established, and the partnership discussed common challenges and identified promising practices at a meeting in Japan. The partnership is also taking steps to institutionalize collaboration and exchange of best practices. Countries committed to promoting women's political and economic participation can join the partnership by contacting EqualFutures@state.gov.
