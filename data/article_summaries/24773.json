The White House has issued a Presidential Memorandum titled "Supporting New American Service Members, Veterans, and their Families." The memorandum emphasizes the importance of recognizing and supporting foreign-born residents and naturalized citizens who serve in the United States Armed Forces. It highlights their contributions to national security and mentions that tens of thousands of lawful permanent residents and naturalized U.S. citizens currently serve in the military. The memorandum acknowledges that service members, veterans, and their families still face barriers in accessing immigration benefits and other assistance. To address these issues, an interagency working group will be established to coordinate records, benefits, and immigration and citizenship services for these individuals. The working group will consist of representatives from various government departments and agencies and will develop a strategic action plan to enhance access to services and benefits. The memorandum also emphasizes the importance of outreach and collaboration with private organizations, nonprofit organizations, and other stakeholders. The implementation of the memorandum will be in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
