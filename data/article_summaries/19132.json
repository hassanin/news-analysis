The United States strongly condemns the military actions taken by the Houthis against the elected government of Yemen. The ongoing violence has caused instability and chaos in the country, endangering the safety of its citizens. In response to the deteriorating situation, Saudi Arabia, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members, and others will undertake military action to defend Saudi Arabia's border and protect Yemen's legitimate government. The United States is providing logistical and intelligence support to GCC-led military operations but is not directly involved in military action. The U.S. will also continue to monitor terrorist threats posed by al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula and take necessary action to protect U.S. citizens. The U.S. urges the Houthis to stop their military actions and return to negotiations for a political resolution, as the international community has made it clear that a violent takeover is unacceptable and a political transition is necessary.
