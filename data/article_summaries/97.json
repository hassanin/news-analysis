The U.S. Department of Justice has finalized a rule to prevent pistols with attached stabilizing braces from falling into dangerous hands. This is because these stabilizing braces can effectively convert a pistol into a short-barreled rifle, which is subject to stricter regulations due to its accuracy and concealability. The gun industry has been exploiting this loophole, leading to tragic incidents such as the shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and Boulder, Colorado. The Justice Department's action aims to regulate these pistols as the dangerous weapons they are, making it more difficult for individuals to obtain them for harmful purposes. The article asserts that this move will save lives and is part of the administration's efforts to reduce gun violence, including the enactment of bipartisan gun safety legislation. However, the author believes that more needs to be done, such as banning assault weapons.
