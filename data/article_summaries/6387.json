President Biden will nominate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. If confirmed, she will be the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court. President Biden conducted a rigorous process to identify a replacement for Justice Stephen Breyer, seeking a candidate with exceptional credentials, unimpeachable character, and dedication to the rule of law. Judge Jackson, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, has broad experience across the legal profession and has been confirmed by the Senate three times. She has served as a federal public defender, a U.S. Sentencing Commission lawyer and commissioner, and a federal district court judge. She has also worked on reducing sentencing disparities and ensuring just and proportionate federal sentences. Judge Jackson graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School and served as a law clerk for Justice Breyer. The Senate is urged to move forward with a fair and timely hearing and confirmation.
