The Assistant to the President and Director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese, along with other officials, convened the directors of the nation's Manufacturing USA Innovation Institute for the first time at the White House. This meeting discussed the important role the Manufacturing USA network plays in advancing American industrial strategy. The United States is implementing a manufacturing and investment agenda to strengthen national competitiveness and promote innovation. Under President Biden's leadership, there has been a boom in American manufacturing, with over 700,000 jobs created. The Manufacturing USA institutes facilitate U.S. leadership in advanced manufacturing and workforce development through public-private partnerships. They are involved in various cutting-edge technologies and have collaborated on over 700 major projects and trained more than 90,000 people. The institutes are located in thirteen states and are sponsored by the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, or the Department of Energy.
