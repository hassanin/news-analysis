President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Kansas and authorized federal aid to assist in the recovery efforts from a severe winter storm that occurred in November 2009. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided on a cost-sharing basis to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Michael R. Scott has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for the recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
