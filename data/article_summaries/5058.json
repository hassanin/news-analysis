President Biden has announced the American Families Plan, which aims to invest in children, families, and the economy. This plan builds on the American Rescue Plan, which has provided relief to American families and communities through stimulus payments and COVID-19 vaccinations. The American Families Plan seeks to create a stronger economy that includes everyone and focuses on enabling those who have dropped out of the workforce, particularly women, to rejoin and stay in the workforce. It includes investments in infrastructure, workforce development, and education. Specifically, it proposes four years of free public education, including universal pre-school for three- and four-year-olds, two years of free community college, and investments in Pell Grants and historically black colleges and universities. The plan also addresses teacher shortages, provides support for children and families through affordable childcare and paid leave, and tackles issues of nutrition and unemployment insurance reform. The plan will be funded through tax reforms that target the wealthy. Overall, the American Families Plan aims to build a stronger middle class and promote inclusive economic growth.
