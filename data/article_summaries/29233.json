The article discusses the resolution put forward by Speaker Pelosi regarding the impeachment proceedings against President Trump. It argues that the impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the beginning as it lacked proper authorization by a House vote. The article also criticizes Chairman Schiff for allegedly repeatedly lying to the American people and conducting one-sided hearings without due process for the President. It states that the White House is barred from participating until after Schiff conducts two rounds of hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee. The article concludes by stating that the resolution fails to address the fact that House Democrats have not provided basic due process rights to the Administration.
