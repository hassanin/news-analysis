President Obama has announced nearly $600 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act awards to support construction and renovation projects at community health centers across the United States. These funds will also help health centers adopt Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other Health Information Technology (HIT) systems. The awards are expected to create new job opportunities and provide care for over half a million additional patients in underserved communities. Additionally, the President announced a new initiative to support the delivery of advanced primary care to Medicare beneficiaries through community health centers. The initiative aims to evaluate the impact of the advanced primary care practice model on access, quality, and cost of care. The funds for these initiatives will be administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). This is part of a series of grants awarded to community health centers to expand healthcare services for low-income and uninsured individuals.
