On March 6, 2014, President Obama declared a national emergency in response to actions and policies that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine, threaten its peace and security, and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets. This national emergency was expanded through subsequent executive orders issued on March 16, 2014, March 20, 2014, December 19, 2014, September 20, 2018, and February 21, 2022. The latest executive order, issued by President Biden, further expands the scope of the national emergency due to the Russian Federation's recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, which contradicts Russia's commitments under the Minsk agreements and poses a threat to Ukraine's peace, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. As a result, the national emergency declared in 2014 must continue beyond March 6, 2022, according to the National Emergencies Act.
