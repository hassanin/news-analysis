On April 21, 2022, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared a national emergency due to a disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations with Russia. This declaration authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to regulate the anchorage and movement of Russian-affiliated vessels. The policies and actions of the Russian government in their war against Ukraine are seen as premeditated, unjustified, unprovoked, and brutal, and continue to pose a threat to international relations. As a result, President Biden has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, along with the emergency authority to regulate the movement of Russian-affiliated vessels to US ports. This decision was made in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
