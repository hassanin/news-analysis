According to an article by Katanga Johnson of Reuters, the United States has regained its position as the most competitive economy in the world, according to the World Economic Forum's annual global competitiveness survey. This is the first time since the 2007-2009 financial crisis that the U.S. has held this position. The new ranking methodology used by the WEF this year has benefited the U.S. In the report, the U.S. scored 85.6 out of 100, beating Singapore, Germany, Switzerland, and Japan. The U.S. was praised for its vibrant entrepreneurial culture and strong labor market and financial system. The last time the U.S. topped the list was in 2008.
