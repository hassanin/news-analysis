The author of the article, Chelsea Adams, expresses her fascination with President Donald Trump and how he has sparked her interest in the political system. Prior to the 2016 presidential election, she admits to not paying much attention to politics. However, Trump's candid and straightforward speaking style compelled her to become more politically aware. She attended multiple Trump rallies, interacted with Americans from all over the country, and became invested in understanding the United States' political system. This led to her securing a political internship at the White House this summer, where she has learned a great deal about politics and gained insight into the concerns of the American people. Adams expresses gratitude for the opportunity to participate in the White House Internship Program and says it has been an honor that she will cherish forever.
