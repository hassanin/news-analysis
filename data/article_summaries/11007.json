On May 9, 2012, President Barack Obama announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. This national emergency was first declared on May 11, 2004, and has been modified and extended several times since then. The President took these actions due to the threat posed by the Syrian government's support for terrorism, occupation of Lebanon, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, and undermining of U.S. and international efforts in Iraq. The brutality and repression of the Syrian regime towards its own citizens, who have been calling for freedom and a representative government, also contribute to the national security concerns. The national emergency and the measures adopted to address it must continue beyond May 11, 2012. The United States condemns the Asad regime's use of violence and human rights abuses and calls for a political transition in Syria towards greater freedom, democracy, opportunity, and justice. The United States will assess any changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Syrian government to determine whether to continue or terminate this national emergency in the future.
