Secretary Austin has announced that the COVID-19 vaccine will be added to the list of required vaccinations for service members by mid-September. The decision is supported by the commitment to ensuring the safety of troops and providing them with the necessary tools for their jobs. The vaccines are deemed safe and effective, with over 350 million shots administered in the United States alone. Vaccination will allow service members to stay healthy, protect their families, and maintain readiness for global operations. The fight against COVID-19, particularly with the spread of the Delta variant, remains crucial, and eligible individuals are urged to get vaccinated immediately. The military will continue to play a leading role in battling the pandemic and setting an example for keeping Americans safe.
