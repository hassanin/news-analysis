President Donald Trump has declared July 2019 as Pledge to America's Workers Month. Last year, he established the President's National Council for the American Worker, which aims to develop a national strategy for training and reskilling workers for high-demand occupations. The Pledge to America's Workers is a call-to-action for states and the private sector to create new education and training opportunities. So far, a majority of the nation's governors and over 280 companies and associations have signed the Pledge, committing to create nearly 10 million enhanced career and training opportunities. President Trump highlights the economic achievements during his administration, including the addition of 5.4 million jobs, wage growth, and a record-low unemployment rate. He also emphasizes the need for inclusive growth and encourages more states and employers to sign the Pledge. The Department of Labor has launched the Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship pathway to promote on-the-job training in emerging sectors. The proclamation concludes by recognizing and applauding those who have signed the Pledge and expressing a commitment to building a prosperous future for all generations.
