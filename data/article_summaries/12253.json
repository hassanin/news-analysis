The Obama Administration has announced conditional commitments for $8.33 billion in loan guarantees for the construction and operation of two new nuclear reactors in Georgia. This project is significant as it will be the first U.S. nuclear power plant to be built in nearly three decades. The goal is to increase the supply of nuclear power to meet growing energy needs and combat climate change. The project is expected to create jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Department of Energy will administer the loan guarantee program, and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission must determine if the reactor meets regulatory requirements. This is the fifth time that conditional commitments for loan guarantees have been offered under The Energy Policy Act of 2005.
