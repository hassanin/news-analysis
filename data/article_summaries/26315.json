A district judge in Texas has issued a nationwide injunction preventing the Trump Administration from using a key source of funds to complete the southwest border wall. The judge argued that building the wall is causing reputational harm and economic disruption to a Texas county and an advocacy group in that county. However, the injunction goes beyond these plaintiffs and blocks multiple projects that are unrelated and hundreds of miles away. The Supreme Court has already stayed a previous injunction blocking the use of a different statutory authority to build the border wall, and the Administration plans to appeal this new decision as well.
