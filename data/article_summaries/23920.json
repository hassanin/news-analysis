In his commencement address at Kalamazoo Central High School, President Barack Obama praised the community for its commitment to providing every child with a quality education. He highlighted the importance of educators raising standards, community members stepping up as tutors and mentors, and parents taking an active interest in their children's education. The President emphasized that success in life is not determined by what is given to you, but by your own efforts and perseverance. He urged the students to take responsibility for both their successes and failures and not to make excuses. Instead, they should strive to do better and push themselves to reach their highest potential.
