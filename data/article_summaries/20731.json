The President has signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 720, called the "Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015," requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to conduct outreach to U.S. airports and surface transportation systems to ensure they have plans in place for responding to security incidents. The second bill, S. 1359, known as the "E-Warranty Act of 2015," allows manufacturers and sellers of consumer products to make warranty terms available to consumers by displaying them in a digital format on their website.
