Ivanka Trump recently traveled to Africa to promote the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative (W-GDP), which aims to empower 50 million women in the developing world by 2025. The initiative focuses on supporting women in the workplace, helping them succeed as entrepreneurs, and advocating for legal reforms to promote gender equality. During her trip, Ivanka Trump met with women who have overcome significant barriers to achieve success. One example is Sara Abera from Ethiopia, who started a textiles and pottery manufacturing business called Muya with assistance from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and private sector partners. With their support, Sara has grown her business from less than 10 to nearly 600 employees. She hires and trains women, benefiting thousands of families and becoming Ethiopia's top exporter of handmade woven garments and pottery.
