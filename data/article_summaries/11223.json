President Obama has amended the Louisiana Disaster Declaration to provide additional disaster assistance to the state. The amendment authorizes an increase in federal funding for Public Assistance projects undertaken in Louisiana as a result of severe storms and flooding that occurred from August 11-31, 2016. Previously, federal funding was available at 75 percent of total eligible costs for Public Assistance, Other Needs Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation. Now, the federal share for Public Assistance has been increased to 90 percent of total eligible costs. This announcement is part of the Administration's ongoing response to the flooding in Louisiana.
