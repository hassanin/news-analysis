President Barack Obama has transmitted the United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-Based Investor-State Arbitration to the Senate for ratification. The Convention aims to apply transparency measures to investor-state arbitrations occurring under international investment agreements concluded before April 2014. These measures include the publication of key documents, opening of hearings to the public, and allowing non-disputing parties to make submissions to the tribunal. The United States has been a leader in promoting transparency in investor-state arbitration, but some older U.S. international investment agreements lack these transparency measures. Ratification of the Convention by the United States is expected to encourage other countries to join. No implementing legislation is required. President Obama recommends the Senate to give early and favorable consideration to the Convention, subject to certain reservations.
