The United States is at risk of losing its position as a global leader due to its outdated infrastructure. This is particularly damaging to rural America, as farmers and communities rely on the nation's waterways, rails, and roads to transport agricultural goods. Many locks and dams operated by the Army Corps of Engineers are over 50 years old and unable to handle the current freight volume. Additionally, a significant portion of rural roads are in poor condition, leading to traffic congestion and delays. Over 10% of rural bridges are rated as "structurally deficient," and many rail lines have been abandoned, limiting access for rural communities. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, has acknowledged the need for better transportation in rural America. A Washington Post poll found that 93% of rural Americans believe federal investments in infrastructure are important. President Trump's "Building a Stronger America" plan aims to address these concerns by allocating $50 billion to modernize and repair rural infrastructure, ultimately improving the quality of life and job prospects for rural communities.
