The letter from President Barack Obama addresses the deteriorating security situation in the Central African Republic. Due to the potential threat to U.S. citizens, embassy personnel and private U.S. citizens were evacuated from Bangui, Central African Republic on December 27, 2012. A standby response and evacuation force of approximately 50 U.S. military personnel from U.S. Africa Command were deployed to Chad to support the evacuation. This force was deployed solely to protect U.S. citizens and property until the evacuation was completed. President Obama states that this action is in line with his responsibility to protect U.S. citizens both at home and abroad, and it is in the interest of U.S. national security and foreign policy. He also mentions that he is providing this report to Congress in accordance with the War Powers Resolution.
