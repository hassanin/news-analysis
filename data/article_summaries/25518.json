This presidential memorandum, issued on April 3, 2019, focuses on combating trafficking in counterfeit and pirated goods. The memorandum highlights the negative effects of counterfeit and pirated goods on American businesses, intellectual property rights holders, consumers, national and economic security, and the American public. It emphasizes the need for improved coordinated efforts within the Federal Government to address this issue. The memorandum calls for a report to be prepared within 210 days to analyze the extent of counterfeit and pirated goods trafficking and make recommendations for administrative, regulatory, legislative, or policy changes. The report should also evaluate the effectiveness of existing policies and procedures of third-party intermediaries and identify areas for collaboration between the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, the report should identify appropriate guidance that agencies can provide to third-party intermediaries and recommend changes to data collection practices. The memorandum provides definitions for terms such as "counterfeit," "pirated," "online third-party marketplace," and "third-party intermediaries." It concludes with general provisions, stating that the memorandum does not impair existing authorities, functions, rights, or obligations under international agreements.
