First Lady Melania Trump celebrated the two-year anniversary of her Be Best initiative, which focuses on issues affecting children such as online safety, opioid abuse, and overall well-being. The initiative promotes values of encouragement, kindness, compassion, healthy living, and respect in children. Melania Trump has traveled domestically and overseas to highlight programs and people dedicated to helping children. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she has applied the values of Be Best by creating public service announcements, donating unused Easter eggs, and providing meals and care packages to frontline workers. As many families turn their homes into classrooms, the First Lady joined a Zoom call with a first-grade teacher and her students to discuss the importance of kindness and compassion. She also learned about the students' distance learning experiences and surprised them with gifts from her Be Best initiative. Melania Trump emphasized the importance of continuing education and reassured the students that they will return to their classrooms soon.
