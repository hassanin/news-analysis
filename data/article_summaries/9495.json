On July 30, 2015, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, S. 971, extends the time period for a Medicare demonstration program that tests incentive payments for teams of medical providers. The second bill, S. 984, revises Medicare payments for speech-generating devices that help individuals who can no longer speak or are severely speech-impaired.
