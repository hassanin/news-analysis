During a recent press briefing, Jeff Zients, the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator, provided an update on the vaccination efforts in the United States. He stated that 77% of eligible Americans (those 12 and older) have received at least their first shot. He also mentioned that vaccination requirements have been effective in increasing vaccination rates, with over 3,500 organizations adopting such requirements. Zients highlighted that higher vaccination rates make workplaces, schools, and communities safer, and also have positive effects on the economy. He cited a study by economists at Goldman Sachs, which suggests that vaccination requirements could help bring up to 5 million workers back into the labor force. Zients emphasized the importance of vaccination requirements and encouraged those who are unvaccinated or eligible for a booster shot to get vaccinated.

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provided an overview of the COVID-19 data. She reported a decrease in cases, hospital admissions, and deaths over the previous week. However, she cautioned that most communities in the country are still experiencing substantial to high levels of transmission. Walensky highlighted the importance of vaccination for eligible individuals and the implementation of prevention strategies, such as masks, improved ventilation, and increased testing, in schools. She mentioned studies that showed the effectiveness of masks in preventing COVID-19 outbreaks in schools and the importance of vaccination in protecting children.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Chief Medical Advisor to the President, discussed the current phase of the outbreak and the goal of achieving control over the virus. He mentioned that the Delta variant is the dominant variant in the United States and that the best way to prevent the emergence of new variants is to get the population vaccinated. Fauci addressed concerns about potential long-term side effects of the vaccines, stating that the safety of the vaccines has been established through extensive data and that serious side effects are very rare. He emphasized that the risks of getting COVID-19 outweigh the risks of vaccination.

Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy provided an update on upcoming vaccine decisions. He mentioned that decisions about booster shots for Moderna and Johnson & Johnson recipients will be made soon by the FDA and CDC following advisory committee meetings. He also mentioned that decisions about vaccines for children aged 5 to 11 will be made in late October and early November. Dr. Murthy emphasized the rigorous and transparent review process for vaccines and expressed confidence in the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines.

In response to a question about airline pilots' concerns about potential side effects impacting their careers, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Murthy reiterated the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, stating that serious side effects are very rare and that getting vaccinated is the best way to protect against the potential long-term health consequences of COVID-19.

When asked about the possibility of COVID-19 being under control, Dr. Fauci stated that it is difficult to give a precise number but suggested that less than 10,000 cases per day would be a reasonable assumption. He mentioned that the existence of a highly effective and safe vaccine for COVID-19 could make the situation better than a typical flu season, but emphasized that getting vaccinated is crucial in achieving control over the virus.

Overall, the briefing highlighted the progress in vaccination efforts, the importance of vaccination requirements, the effectiveness of prevention strategies in schools, and the ongoing review process for boosters and vaccines for children. The officials stressed the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines and encouraged eligible individuals to get vaccinated.
