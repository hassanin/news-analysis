The Presidential Memorandum titled "Accelerating Technology Transfer and Commercialization of Federal Research in Support of High-Growth Businesses" outlines the policy and actions to be taken by executive departments and agencies to increase the rate of technology transfer and commercialization of federal research. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of innovation in fueling economic growth and the need for the private sector to adapt federal research for use in the marketplace. The goals of the memorandum include improving the results from technology transfer and commercialization activities over the next five years, while also achieving excellence in research activities. The memorandum directs agencies to establish performance goals, metrics, and evaluation methods to measure progress in technology transfer activities. It also calls for the improvement and expansion of metrics in the Department of Commerce's annual technology transfer summary report. Additionally, the memorandum encourages agencies to streamline licensing procedures, improve public availability of federally owned inventions, and enhance the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (SBTT) programs. It also emphasizes the importance of fostering partnerships with external organizations, such as universities, industry consortia, and state and local governments, to enhance technology innovation networks. The memorandum concludes with general provisions, including the definition of "Federal laboratories" and the applicability of the memorandum to independent agencies.
