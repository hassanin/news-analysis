On Earth Day, President Biden signed an Executive Order to address the climate crisis, protect against wildfire threats, and support local economies. The order aims to reduce wildfire risk by implementing science-based fuels and forest health treatments, with a goal of treating an additional 50 million acres across federal and non-federal lands. It also provides funding for forest and land management activities, firefighter pay, and community wildfire defense grants. The order prioritizes the restoration of old-growth forests and calls for a holistic, science-based approach to wildfire resilience and forest restoration. Additionally, the order focuses on strengthening forests to support thriving local economies, providing planning assistance for outdoor recreation, supporting community forests, and expanding markets for wood products and wood energy. President Biden has also committed to combatting global deforestation and restoring lands, particularly in the Amazon, Congo, and Southeast Asian forests. The order directs the Department of State to prepare reports on stopping global deforestation and restoring lands. Lastly, the order emphasizes the importance of nature-based solutions in addressing climate change, including conserving at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030 and utilizing nature's ability to absorb climate pollution and increase resilience in all communities.
