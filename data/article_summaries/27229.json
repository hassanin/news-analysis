Secretary Shulkin held a press briefing to discuss President Trump's upcoming signing of an executive order titled "Improving Accountability and Whistleblower Protection" at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The order establishes an Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Office, which will be responsible for identifying barriers that prevent the removal of employees who have deviated from the values of the VA. The office will report directly to Secretary Shulkin and will address issues of accountability, whistleblower protection, and systemic barriers within the VA. The executive order is part of the administration's commitment to improving accountability and ensuring that employees are committed to serving veterans. Secretary Shulkin also addressed concerns about the cost and staffing of the office, as well as its relationship to the Office of Accountability Review and the White House hotline for VA complaints. He emphasized the importance of protecting whistleblowers and addressing issues of fraud and abuse. Secretary Shulkin acknowledged the need for legislative support in addition to the executive order to effectively address accountability issues within the VA. He also discussed efforts to improve customer service and training for VA employees. Finally, Secretary Shulkin provided an update on the Washington, D.C. medical center, which recently experienced issues with its inventory control system. He assured that patient safety was not compromised and that actions were being taken to address the issue.
