President Obama is urging House Republicans to pass the Middle Class Tax Cut Extension. He argues that the Republicans are the only ones preventing the tax cuts for 98% of Americans and small business owners. He emphasizes that middle-class families cannot afford a $2,200 tax increase next year. Obama calls on Republicans to abandon their demand for a $1 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest Americans and prioritize the financial security of families and small businesses. He believes that a strong and growing middle class is essential for a robust economy.
