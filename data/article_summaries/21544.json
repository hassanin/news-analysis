On May 31, 2011, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 793, designates a United States Postal Service facility in Inverness, California, as the "Specialist Jake Robert Velloza Post Office". The second bill, H.R. 1893, is known as the "Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2011". This bill extends authorities to collect taxes that fund the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, make expenditures from the fund, and make grants to airports under the Airport Improvement Program. The extension is valid until June 30, 2011.
