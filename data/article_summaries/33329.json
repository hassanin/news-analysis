The Iranian regime has announced that it will increase its uranium enrichment, which is seen as a violation of the Iran nuclear deal. The United States believes it was a mistake to allow Iran to enrich uranium at any level. The US and its allies are committed to preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons and will continue to exert maximum pressure on the Iranian regime until it changes its behavior. The US calls for an end to Iran's nuclear ambitions and its malign behavior.
