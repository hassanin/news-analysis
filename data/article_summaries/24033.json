President Obama has declared a major disaster in West Virginia and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts following severe storms, flooding, mudslides, and landslides that occurred in June 2010. Federal funding will be available for affected individuals and businesses in Logan, McDowell, Mingo, and Wyoming Counties. This assistance can include grants for temporary housing and repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. State and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, can also receive federal funding for emergency work and facility repair or replacement. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will be eligible for cost-sharing federal funding. Donald L. Keldsen has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
