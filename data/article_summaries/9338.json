President Joe Biden will sign National Security Memorandum-15 (NSM-15) and launch the National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Health Security. The strategy aims to protect the nation from future pandemics and biological threats by transforming the biodefense and health security efforts across 20 federal agencies. It emphasizes the need for coordination with international, state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners. The strategy recognizes that infectious diseases that cross borders and disrupt societies are a threat to national security and global stability. It highlights the risks of outbreaks from various sources and the challenges posed by urbanization, climate change, habitat encroachment, and the weaponization of biological agents. The administration is already implementing key actions in the strategy but will require additional resources from Congress. The strategy focuses on detecting, preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from biological incidents. It aims to improve early warning systems, prevent outbreaks from becoming epidemics, prepare for pandemics, rapidly respond to outbreaks, and recover from incidents. The strategy also emphasizes the coordination of biodefense efforts across the federal government. Overall, the strategy aims to protect the American people against disease outbreaks, pandemics, and biological weapons use while strengthening the health of the homeland.
