Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz announced that President Obama will address the 95th Convention of Disabled American Veterans, marking his final major address to veterans. The President will highlight the progress made in reducing veterans' homelessness by nearly half since 2010, and by 17 percent since last year. He will also discuss the participation of 500,000 veterans in the VA's Million Veteran Program, a critical halfway point to the goal of signing up 1 million veterans. The President will emphasize the necessary transformation at the Veterans Administration and argue against proposals that would gut funding for veterans' care or privatize the VA. Schultz also addressed questions about the President's stance on Gold Star families, the progress made at the VA, airstrikes in Libya against ISIS targets, the response to Zika in Florida, the downing of a Russian military helicopter in Syria, and the investigation into cyber attacks on the DNC.
