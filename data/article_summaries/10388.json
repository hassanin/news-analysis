President Obama has declared a major disaster in North Carolina due to the effects of Hurricane Irene. Federal funding will be provided to assist individuals and businesses in the affected counties, including grants for housing and repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other recovery programs. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding. Michael E. Bolch has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the area. Additional counties and assistance may be designated once damage assessments are completed. Residents and business owners can apply for assistance online or by phone.
