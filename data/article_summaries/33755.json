The Trump Administration is taking swift action to combat the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The National Security Council staff is coordinating the response in collaboration with various departments and agencies. The goal is to contain outbreaks at their source before they spread regionally or globally. The United States has committed to investing $1 billion to support partner countries and build capacity through the Global Health Security Agenda. USAID is contributing up to $8 million to combat the Ebola outbreak in the DRC, and other international partners have also made significant contributions. The United States Government is providing supplies, expertise, and funding to augment the DRC's efforts. The CDC and USAID have deployed staff to support outbreak-control activities, and HHS has shipped rapid diagnostic tests. The United States is also assisting the Republic of the Congo in setting up diagnostic capabilities and disease surveillance. The United States' investments in global health security and biomedical innovation are contributing to the ongoing efforts. The threat to the homeland from Ebola remains low, but measures are being taken to decrease the risk of regional spread and protect borders. The United States remains committed to aiding partners on the ground in the DRC and ensuring global health security.
