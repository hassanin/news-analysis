The United States welcomes the agreement signed between Ukrainian President Yanukovych and Opposition leaders, which is consistent with their calls for de-escalation of violence, constitutional change, a coalition government, and early elections. The US supports the efforts of those who negotiated the agreement and offers its support in its implementation. Immediate implementation of initial steps, such as ending violence, amnesty, security normalization, and passage of the constitutional package, is called for to create space for negotiations on the formation of a technocratic coalition government. Respect for the right of peaceful protest is emphasized, and accountability for those responsible for violence is demanded. The US stands with the Ukrainian people in their pursuit of peace, security, and human dignity.
