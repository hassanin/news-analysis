President Barack Obama has signed an Executive Order creating a Presidential Emergency Board to help resolve a dispute between major freight rail carriers and their unions. The board will provide a structure for the two sides to resolve their disagreements and will deliver a report to the President within 30 days, recommending how the dispute should be resolved. President Obama has appointed five members to the board, including Ira F. Jaffe as Chair, Roberta Golick, Joshua M. Javits, Gil Vernon, and Arnold M. Zack. Each member has a wealth of experience in labor and employment disputes. The President emphasized the importance of ensuring the smooth operation of the freight rail system for the economy and expressed gratitude to the board members for their service.
