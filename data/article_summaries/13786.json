Vice President Joe Biden spoke separately with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and President Petro Poroshenko to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine. Biden condemned the offensive by Russia-backed separatists in Debaltseve, which was supported by Russian regular troops in violation of the Minsk agreements and Ukraine's sovereignty. Biden agreed with both leaders that Russia cannot hide behind the claim that the operations are solely the work of local separatists. He also discussed options for monitoring the cease-fire and withdrawal of heavy weapons, given the separatists' denial of access to the OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission.
