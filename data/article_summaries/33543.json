President Trump signed two bills aimed at promoting women in STEM fields. The first bill, the INSPIRE Women Act, ensures that NASA programs recruit women for STEM-related jobs and aerospace careers. The second bill, the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act, allows the National Science Foundation to support women inventors, researchers, and scientists in bringing their discoveries to the business world. President Trump emphasized the need for policies that support women in the workforce and address the barriers faced by women in STEM fields. He expressed his desire for American women with STEM degrees to be able to find jobs that can support their families and fulfill the American Dream.
