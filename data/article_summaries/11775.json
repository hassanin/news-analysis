President Obama has declared a major disaster in Virginia and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts from Hurricane Matthew. The funding will be available to individuals and businesses in Chesapeake, Newport News, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Hazard mitigation measures will also be available on a cost-sharing basis for the entire state. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and deemed necessary. Residents and business owners affected can begin applying for assistance online or by phone.
