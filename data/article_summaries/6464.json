The President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has submitted a notice to the Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Burma, declared in Executive Order 14014 on February 10, 2021, will continue beyond February 10, 2022. This decision is based on the ongoing situation in Burma, particularly the military coup that occurred on February 1, 2021. The coup involved the overthrow of the democratically elected civilian government and the unjust arrest and detention of government leaders, politicians, human rights defenders, journalists, and religious leaders. These actions undermine Burma's democratic transition and rule of law and pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
