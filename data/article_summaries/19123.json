On October 2, 2013, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 527, known as the "Helium Stewardship Act of 2013," authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to continue selling crude helium from the Federal Helium Reserve for a specific period of time. It also extends payments to certain counties under the Secure Rural Schools program, increases the cap on payments to States that have completed high-priority coal mine reclamation projects, provides $50 million for the remediation and reclamation of abandoned oil and gas wells within the National Petroleum Reserve, provides $50 million to the National Park Service for maintenance and infrastructure projects in national parks, and requires the Bureau of Land Management to reduce the royalty on the value of soda ash and certain related minerals produced on Federal lands to 4 percent for two years. The second bill, S. 793, known as the "Organization of American States Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013," promotes reform of the Organization of American States.
