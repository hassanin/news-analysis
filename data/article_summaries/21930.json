These actions include expanding access to treatment, establishing a Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force, implementing mental health and substance use disorder parity in Medicaid, preventing opioid overdose deaths, expanding public health-public safety partnerships to combat the spread of heroin, investing in community policing to address heroin, tackling substance use disorders in rural communities, implementing syringe services programs, and securing private sector commitments to address the epidemic. The actions aim to increase access to treatment, prevent overdose deaths, and increase community prevention strategies. Several medical schools and pharmacies have also made commitments to help combat the epidemic.
