In this proclamation, President Donald Trump recognizes the importance of the transportation infrastructure system in the United States. He acknowledges the contributions of the hardworking Americans who ensure the safety and efficiency of the transportation system. However, he also highlights the need for infrastructure improvements, as many roads, rails, ports, and airports are in disrepair. One of the main causes of delay in infrastructure improvements is the broken permitting process. To address this issue, the President directed federal agencies to implement a One Federal Decision policy and complete environmental reviews for major infrastructure projects within 2 years. The administration has also proposed updates to the regulations that implement the National Environmental Policy Act to reduce the time required for environmental impact statements. The President emphasizes the importance of revitalizing the infrastructure system to promote commerce, protect public safety, and enhance national defense. He expresses the administration's commitment to working with Congress to invest in the repair and modernization of transportation infrastructure. The proclamation also recognizes National Defense Transportation Day on May 15, 2020, and National Transportation Week from May 10 to May 16, 2020, and encourages Americans to celebrate these observances.
