President Biden, along with Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, and other officials, held a roundtable discussion to address the shortage of infant formula in the United States. The shortage was caused by the closure of one of Abbott's infant formula plants in February due to contaminated formula. The President directed his administration to use every available tool to increase the supply of formula and lower costs for American families. The administration has taken several actions to address the shortage, including invoking the Defense Production Act to prioritize manufacturers' access to materials, launching Operation Fly Formula to airlift formula that meets safety standards, and reviewing applications for new, high-quality imports. The manufacturers participating in the discussion provided updates on their efforts to increase production and distribute formula to families in need. The Surgeon General emphasized the importance of safety, reassured parents that formula on the shelves meets FDA standards, and urged parents not to water down formula or make it at home. The President expressed gratitude for the manufacturers' efforts and emphasized the administration's commitment to resolving the shortage.
