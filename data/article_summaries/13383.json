President Obama has issued a statement on the Department of Defense (DOD) report regarding the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. He states that he is committed to repealing this law as it weakens national security, hinders military readiness, and goes against American principles of fairness and equality. The report confirms that a majority of military personnel and their families are prepared to serve alongside openly gay and lesbian individuals. It also shows that transitioning to a new policy can be done responsibly without compromising military strength and national security. Both the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have publicly endorsed ending this policy. President Obama urges the Senate to pass the necessary legislation to repeal this discriminatory policy, emphasizing that American troops and their families deserve certainty and fairness. He believes that the military will adapt to this change while remaining the best fighting force in the world.
