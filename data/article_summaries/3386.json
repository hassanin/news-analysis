The United States and the European Commission have reached a preliminary agreement on a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. This framework aims to address concerns raised by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Schrems II decision of July 2020, which questioned the adequacy of data protection measures in the US. The agreement includes commitments from the US to strengthen privacy and civil liberties protections related to signals intelligence activities. New safeguards will be put in place to ensure that surveillance activities are necessary and proportionate for national security objectives. Additionally, an independent redress mechanism with binding authority will be established to direct remedial measures, and oversight of signals intelligence activities will be enhanced. The Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework is the result of over a year of negotiations between the US and the EU. It aims to provide a stable foundation for trans-Atlantic data flows, which are crucial for protecting citizens' rights and facilitating trans-Atlantic commerce. The framework will promote an inclusive digital economy and support cooperation between the US and the EU on digital policies. The next step is for both sides to translate the agreement into legal documents that will be adopted to establish the new framework.
