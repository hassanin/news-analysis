This article is a Presidential Memorandum from August 13, 2009, regarding drug interdiction assistance to Colombia. The memorandum states that the interdiction of aircraft suspected of being involved in illicit drug trafficking in Colombia's airspace is necessary due to the significant threat it poses to the country's national security. It also specifies that Colombia has appropriate procedures in place to minimize innocent loss of life during these interdictions, including warning aircraft before the use of force is employed. The Secretary of State is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register and notify Congress accordingly. The memorandum is signed by President Barack Obama.
