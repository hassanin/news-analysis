President Obama has declared a major disaster in Vermont due to severe storms and flooding that occurred in May 2011. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Affected individuals in Caledonia and Washington counties can receive assistance such as grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help with recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and facility repair or replacement in Caledonia County, as well as statewide hazard mitigation measures. Craig A. Gilbert has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
