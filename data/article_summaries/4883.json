During a teleconference, Vice President Harris discussed the recent attacks on reproductive rights in the United States. She emphasized that these attacks are extreme and endanger the lives of women. The Vice President and President Biden believe in the freedom for women to make decisions about their own healthcare and bodies, without government interference. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, many states have proposed and passed new laws to ban abortion or enforce old laws that restrict access to reproductive healthcare. For example, Florida recently introduced a bill to ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. These attacks on reproductive rights not only impact women's autonomy but also endanger their health. The Vice President highlighted a lawsuit filed by five women in Texas who were denied healthcare due to the state's abortion ban. One of the plaintiffs almost lost her life due to complications. The Vice President also expressed concern about the broader implications of these attacks, including the potential for politicians to override FDA-approved medications. She emphasized the need for Congress to pass a bill that protects reproductive rights and puts the protections of Roe v. Wade into federal law. The Vice President also discussed the importance of accurate information, support for abortion providers, and the impact of these restrictions on marginalized communities, such as African American women who already face high maternal mortality rates.
