Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of Energy Steven Chu have announced that the U.S. Department of Energy is awarding $106 million in funding for 37 energy research projects. These projects aim to develop advanced biofuels, create new types of batteries for electric vehicles, and find more cost-effective ways to remove carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. The projects will take place in 17 states and involve a mix of small businesses, educational institutions, national labs, and large corporations. The funding is part of the overall $100 billion investment made by the Recovery Act to create jobs and drive economic growth through innovation, science, and technology. The projects were selected through a rigorous review process and were evaluated based on their scientific and technical merit and potential impact on national energy and economic goals.
