One year ago, President Biden and Vice President Harris hosted the United We Stand Summit to address the impact of hate-fueled violence on democracy and public safety. The summit aimed to highlight the response of the Biden-Harris Administration and communities across the country to these dangers, and present a shared vision for a more united America. The article emphasizes that hate should have no place in America, and that Americans of all beliefs and political affiliations oppose violence motivated by hate.

Since taking office, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken several steps to counter hate-fueled violence. These include signing the bipartisan COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, releasing the first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, and signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which aims to reduce gun violence and is considered the most significant legislation in this area in three decades.

The administration recognizes that addressing hate-based violence and fostering national unity requires efforts from all sectors of society, not just the government. Private sector partners have also made progress on commitments announced at the United We Stand Summit. The article does not provide specific details on these private sector efforts.
