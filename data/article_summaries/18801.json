This article is a presidential memorandum from October 16, 2009, regarding the provision of U.S. drug interdiction assistance to the government of Brazil. The memorandum states that the interdiction of aircraft involved in illicit drug trafficking in Brazil's airspace is necessary due to the significant threat it poses to the country's national security. It also emphasizes that Brazil has appropriate procedures in place to prevent innocent loss of life during interdictions, including effective means to identify and warn an aircraft before the use of force is directed against it. The Secretary of State is authorized to publish this determination in the Federal Register and notify Congress. The memorandum is signed by President Barack Obama.
