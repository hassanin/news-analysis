On November 11, 2009, President Barack Obama signed the "Military Spouses Residency Relief Act" into law. This Act allows military spouses to retain residency in their home state for voting and tax purposes even if they relocate with their service member spouse due to military orders. Previously, military spouses had to pay taxes in their new state and lose their right to vote in their home state. The purpose of this legislation is to alleviate burdens on military families and maintain the morale and readiness of the Armed Forces. It is also intended to enhance the military's ability to recruit and retain valuable service personnel.
