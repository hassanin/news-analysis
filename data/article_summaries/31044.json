The Trump Administration is focused on strengthening policies to support working families in the United States. They aim to increase access to affordable, high-quality child care to help parents balance work and raising children. The labor force participation of women with children under 18 has grown significantly over the years, and child care costs have become a significant burden for many families. High child care costs can impact labor supply and productivity, as well as economic development. The Administration's reform principles include increasing investment in child care, building the supply of child care, cultivating the child care workforce, and improving options for families in high-quality settings. The goal is to ensure that child care settings promote healthy child development and well-being.
