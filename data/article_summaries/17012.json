Vice President Biden has delivered his first quarterly report to the President on the progress of implementing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The report highlights the early progress made in providing financial relief for American families and initiating job-creating projects. In the first 77 days of the program, 150,000 jobs have been created or saved, over $88 billion has been made available for programs and projects, and over 3,000 transportation construction projects have been funded. Additionally, working families are benefitting from the Making Work Pay tax credit, COBRA health insurance premiums have been reduced, and unemployment benefits have increased. States have also received funds to avoid budget cuts and improve education programs. Looking ahead, an additional 600,000 jobs are expected to be created or saved in the next 100 days, and more contracts and grants will be awarded. The report includes stories from local communities to provide a snapshot of people's thoughts and experiences with the Recovery Act. This is the first of a series of updates that the Vice President will provide as the funds are put to work.
