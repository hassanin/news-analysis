The White House has issued an executive order titled "Supporting the Transition of Active Duty Service Members and Military Veterans into the Merchant Marine." The order aims to make it easier for veterans to transition into high-paying jobs in the Merchant Marine by waiving government-issued licensing fees and crediting military training. The Merchant Marine is an important part of the U.S. Defense Industrial Base, responsible for delivering military equipment and personnel. There is currently a shortage of Merchant Mariners, and this executive order seeks to address that shortfall. The order is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to support veterans in their transition to civilian life and to emphasize the connection between economic security and national security.
