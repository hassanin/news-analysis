The White House has announced new actions and progress made to make American buildings more efficient and save businesses and households on their energy bills. Through President Obama's Better Buildings Initiative, the Department of Energy is partnering with organizations across the country to drive increased investment in energy efficiency. Over the last five years, Better Buildings partners and energy savings have more than tripled. Today, there are more than 750 organizations engaged in the initiative. The new actions include launching three new programs to improve the resilience of buildings, increase energy efficiency in low-income communities, and make wastewater systems more efficient. Additionally, 17 businesses, states, and cities have achieved Better Buildings challenge goals four years early, and 32 new cities, universities, K-12 school districts, multifamily housing organizations, and manufacturers have committed to achieving 20 percent energy savings by 2020. Since the Better Buildings Challenge was launched, it has catalyzed more than $10 billion in public and private sector financing commitments, expanded the partners working to improve energy efficiency, saved businesses and communities $1.3 billion on their energy bills, avoided 10 million tons of carbon emissions, and saved 2.1 billion gallons of water in 2015 alone. The announcement also includes the launching of three new Better Buildings Accelerators to create new opportunities and overcome barriers to improving efficiency, as well as the announcement of 18 organizations that have achieved their Better Buildings goals ahead of schedule.
