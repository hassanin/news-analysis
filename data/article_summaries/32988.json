During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders highlighted the positive impact of President Trump's economic policies on American workers, including the lowest unemployment rates since 2000 and record low unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics. She also mentioned that the President is closely monitoring the situation in Hawaii following the earthquake and volcanic eruption. Sanders expressed support for Gina Haspel, the nominee for CIA director, stating that she is highly qualified and has the necessary experience to lead the agency. Sanders also congratulated two members of the White House press corps on their recent engagement. During the briefing, Sanders faced questions regarding Haspel's possible withdrawal from consideration, the President's view on Don Blankenship's chances of winning an election in West Virginia, and whether there are other women who received money to stay quiet about alleged affairs with President Trump. Sanders referred these questions to the President's outside counsel. Other topics discussed during the briefing included the upcoming decision on the Iran nuclear deal, the recent protests in Russia, the ongoing Russia investigation, and the First Lady's upcoming initiative on cyberbullying.
