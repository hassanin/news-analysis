During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest discussed a variety of topics including the troop announcement in Afghanistan and the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Earnest emphasized the progress made in Afghanistan and the reduction in troop levels, while also highlighting the need for Congress to provide adequate funding for troops. He also discussed the ongoing FBI investigation into Clinton's emails, stating that it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the investigation while it is still ongoing. Earnest mentioned that the President is aware of the situation in Baton Rouge, where Alton Sterling was killed by police, but could not comment further as the Department of Justice is conducting an investigation. He also addressed the issue of security sanctions for Clinton and the use of the presidential seal at political events. Earnest reiterated the administration's commitment to fighting the opioid epidemic and expressed disappointment in Congress for not providing additional funding. He also discussed the VA report and the progress made in improving access to healthcare for veterans. Earnest did not comment on the President's reaction to Comey's announcement or on Trump's comments about Clinton and the email investigation.
