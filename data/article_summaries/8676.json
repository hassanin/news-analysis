Senior Advisor to President Biden and White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu and Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su will travel to Baltimore, Maryland to attend the Workforce Hub convening. Baltimore is one of the five Workforce Hubs named by the Biden-Harris Administration, where investments from President Biden's agenda are creating good-paying jobs. The administration has announced $9.6 billion in projects across Maryland, including transportation upgrades, clean energy delivery, high-speed internet access, and clean water initiatives. Some key investments in Baltimore include the replacement of the Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel, ecosystem restoration, high-speed internet installation, and train station upgrades. The administration is partnering with local officials, employers, unions, community colleges, and other stakeholders to ensure a diverse and skilled workforce is ready to meet the demand for labor in transportation projects. The collaborators at the Workforce Hub are making commitments to expand pathways into these good-paying jobs, including prioritizing Baltimore residents for job opportunities, expanding union job opportunities, and implementing new training programs for construction careers.
