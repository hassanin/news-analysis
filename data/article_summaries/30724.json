According to a Gallup survey, Americans' positive evaluations of the economy continue to persist. 55% of Americans rate economic conditions as either excellent or good, while 14% describe them as poor. Additionally, 57% say the economy is getting better compared to 36% who say it is getting worse. This positive sentiment is reflected in Gallup's Economic Confidence Index, which is essentially unchanged from last month and ranks among the best measured since the late 1990s and early 2000s. The survey also found that 68% of Americans believe it is now a good time to find a quality job, tying the record high from last month. Despite recent volatility in the stock market, Americans' confidence in the economy remains strong.
