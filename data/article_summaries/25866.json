The stock market is not only a measure of the health of the economy, but also reflects confidence, optimism, and expectations of the future economy. Since the Trump election, the stock market has increased by over 35 percent, adding $6 trillion to America's net wealth. A strong stock market benefits not only the rich, but also the working class who have investments in 401k plans, IRAs, and pensions. The Trump tax cut has played a major role in the stock market's rise, as it increases the value of after-tax earnings to shareholders. The economy is currently growing at a rate of 3 percent annually, with some economists predicting 4 percent growth next year.
