President Obama will sign a Presidential Memorandum to modernize the Federal infrastructure permitting process, cutting timelines in half for major infrastructure projects. This initiative aims to create incentives for better outcomes for communities and the environment. By reducing red tape and expediting the review and approval process, the administration hopes to start construction sooner, create jobs earlier, and improve the nation's infrastructure faster. Since the launch of a government-wide initiative to improve efficiency in March 2012, agencies have expedited the review and permitting of 50 major projects, including bridges, transit projects, railways, waterways, roads, and renewable energy. The President's Executive Order has also identified best practices for efficient review and permitting, such as utilizing information technology tools and improving collaboration between agencies. The administration's first annual Report to the President provides further details on this initiative and its achievements so far. The President's Budget calls for immediate investment of $50 billion in the nation's transportation infrastructure, with $40 billion allocated for "fix-it-first" projects that target areas in urgent need of repair. The President has also proposed a "Rebuild America Partnership" to encourage partnerships between the private sector and government entities to enhance infrastructure investment and improve transportation, electric, water, and communications networks in the United States.
