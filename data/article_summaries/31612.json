First Lady Melania Trump hosted the official reopening of the White House Rose Garden. The restoration project returned the garden to its original 1962 blueprint designed by Bunny Mellon. The First Lady thanked those who made the renewal possible and highlighted the role of agricultural and horticultural experts in ensuring the garden's success. The restoration improved accessibility for those with disabilities. The project was a joint effort by landscape architecture firms, Perry Guillot, Inc and Oehme, van Sweden & Associates/OvS, and was approved by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. The First Lady's interior designer, Tham Kannalikham, also played a role in executing the vision. The First Lady emphasized the significance of gardens as symbols of growth and hope.
