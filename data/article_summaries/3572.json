Millions of people in the United States are victims of crime every year, which can have a lasting impact on their sense of trust and safety. However, there are stories of triumph and resilience that inspire hope. During the 40th National Crime Victims' Rights Week, the Biden-Harris Administration acknowledges the importance of supporting and assisting crime victims. There are various programs funded by the Federal Crime Victims Fund that provide quality services to victims, but there are still barriers preventing many victims from accessing the support they need and receiving justice. Factors such as fear of negative interactions with law enforcement or the criminal justice system, particularly for victims from communities of color, contribute to underreporting of crimes. Building trust, increasing access to services, and improving public safety are essential. The voices of those affected by gun violence, including victims, their families, and supporters of commonsense measures, are advocating for policies that address this issue. The Biden Administration is committed to ending the epidemic of gun violence. Supporting crime victims is part of a broader effort to promote equity and fairness in society. The Office for Victims of Crime is investing in initiatives to improve access to services and safety for marginalized and underserved communities, as well as supporting community-led violence prevention efforts. The administration is also taking action to address anti-Asian violence and harassment and support victims in American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Every crime victim deserves justice and the assurance of their safety and well-being. It is crucial to work together to prevent crimes, provide support to victims, and ensure their recovery. President Biden proclaims April 18-24, 2021, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week, calling upon all Americans to raise awareness of victims' rights and services and volunteer to assist victims in need.
