President Trump has signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, which funds several federal agencies until September 30, 2019. However, the President has expressed concerns about certain provisions that he believes could interfere with his constitutional authorities. These include provisions that require advance notice to Congress before certain military actions, restrict the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States, interfere with the President's ability to negotiate international agreements and represent the US in international fora, and limit the President's authority to supervise the executive branch. The President also asserts his authority to withhold information that could impair foreign relations or national security, and to recommend or not recommend legislation to Congress. Additionally, the President rejects provisions that condition spending decisions on the approval of congressional committees, considering them to be impermissible forms of congressional aggrandizement.
