President Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals for the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Judge Barrett is highly qualified, having graduated from Rhodes College and Notre Dame Law School and clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia. She was confirmed as a Federal judge in 2017 after a bipartisan vote by the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Ted Cruz have expressed their support for her nomination. Judge Barrett, a dedicated wife and mother of seven, would bring a unique perspective to the Court. She emphasized the importance of judges prioritizing the Constitution over personal views on the law. If confirmed, she promises to serve the American people and administer justice impartially.
