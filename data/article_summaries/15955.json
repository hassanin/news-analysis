President Barack Obama will award Specialist Leslie H. Sabo, Jr., U.S. Army, the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions in combat on May 10, 1970. Sabo charged the enemy position, killed several enemy soldiers, and successfully drew their fire away from friendly soldiers. He shielded a wounded comrade from an enemy grenade blast, but ultimately lost his life. Sabo's widow and brother will join the President at the White House to commemorate his selfless service and sacrifice. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who display great personal bravery or self-sacrifice, above and beyond the call of duty.
