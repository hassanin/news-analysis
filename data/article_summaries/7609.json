The United States and Australia have recognized climate change as a threat to global stability, security, and prosperity. They emphasize the importance of accelerating the global clean energy transformation to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The United States supports Australia's efforts to become a renewable energy powerhouse, while Australia welcomes the United States' actions to lead in clean energy and innovation. Both countries are committed to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement through their respective plans to reduce inflation and power Australia. They aim to support a stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific by diversifying clean energy supply chains and creating economic opportunities in the region. The United States and Australia also emphasize the importance of an inclusive transition to net zero emissions, with a focus on collaboration with communities disproportionately affected by climate change. To enhance their cooperation, they plan to establish a Climate, Critical Minerals, and Clean Energy Transformation Compact as a central pillar of their alliance. This Compact will promote ambitious climate and clean energy action, including the expansion of clean energy supply chains and the development of markets for emerging technologies and critical minerals. They also acknowledge the current impacts of climate change on communities and commit to supporting global climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience efforts. Both countries will provide progress reports on the Compact by the end of 2023.
