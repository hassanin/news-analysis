President Barack Obama signed the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2010, which provides assistance to two and a half million Americans who lost their jobs during the recession. The extension had been blocked multiple times by a partisan minority, but has now been passed to help those struggling to find employment. The President called on Congress to take further action to support economic recovery, including providing aid to states and support to small businesses. He emphasized the importance of small businesses for job growth and urged that measures to cut their taxes and improve lending should not be delayed by partisan tactics.
