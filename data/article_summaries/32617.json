President Donald J. Trump has received a report from the Department of State regarding the reform of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) in line with the policies of the United States. The report states that sufficient progress has not been made in reforming the terms of the UPU. The report recommends adopting self-declared rates for terminal dues by January 1, 2020, and filing notice of withdrawal from the UPU, starting a one-year withdrawal process. The Department of State will also seek to negotiate agreements to resolve the issues outlined in the report, and if successful, the notice of withdrawal will be rescinded.
