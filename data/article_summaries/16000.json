The White House has issued a Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) on critical infrastructure security and resilience. This directive updates the national approach from Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7, which was issued in 2003, to address the new risk environment and improve capabilities. The directive emphasizes the importance of proactive and coordinated efforts to strengthen and maintain secure and resilient critical infrastructure, which includes assets, networks, and systems vital to public confidence and national safety. The responsibility for this endeavor is shared among federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial entities, as well as public and private owners and operators of critical infrastructure. The directive recognizes the diverse and complex nature of the nation's critical infrastructure, which includes distributed networks, various organizational structures, interdependent functions, and governance constructs. It highlights the unique position of critical infrastructure owners and operators in managing risks and determining effective strategies for security and resilience. The directive aims to create a stronger alliance between physical and cyber security and resilience. It identifies three strategic imperatives: refining and clarifying functional relationships across the federal government, enabling effective information exchange, and implementing an integration and analysis function to inform planning and operational decisions. The directive sets out six key deliverables, including developing a description of functional relationships within the Department of Homeland Security and across the federal government, assessing the existing public-private partnership model, identifying baseline data and systems requirements, developing a situational awareness capability, updating the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, and completing a national critical infrastructure security and resilience research and development plan.
