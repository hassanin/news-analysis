President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation regarding the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States. In the proclamation, Trump states that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in quantities and under circumstances that threaten to impair national security. As a result, he decided to impose a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. However, he also noted that countries with a security relationship with the United States, such as Argentina, Australia, and Brazil, are exempt from the tariff while ongoing discussions are taking place to address the threat to national security. The proclamation also mentions that discussions are continuing with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union, and if satisfactory alternative means to address the threat are not finalized soon, the tariff will be re-imposed on these countries. The proclamation concludes by stating that the tariff on aluminum articles will remain in effect for other countries until further changes are made.
