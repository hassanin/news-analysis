President Trump announced that he has decided to terminate the planned summit with North Korea in Singapore on June 12th. He stated that while there is still potential for positive developments, he believes this is a setback for North Korea and the world. He assured that the US military is ready if necessary and that South Korea and Japan are willing to shoulder the financial burden of any operations. He expressed hope that North Korea will choose to follow the path of denuclearization and join the community of nations. He emphasized that the safety and security of the United States will never be compromised. President Trump also signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act into law, which aims to roll back the regulations of the Dodd-Frank Act that have been burdensome for community banks and credit unions. He highlighted the importance of small banks in local lending and their role in providing access to capital for small businesses. The legislation also strengthens protections against identity theft, expands financial access to low-income and minority communities, and provides more educational and job-training opportunities. President Trump praised the progress of the country's economic comeback, including the passage of tax cuts and job-killing regulation cuts, as well as the low unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanics, and women. He mentioned the administration's efforts in reclaiming manufacturing jobs and addressing trade issues with China. He also mentioned the passage of the Right to Try Act, which gives terminally ill patients access to experimental drugs. The President thanked the members of Congress for their work and emphasized the importance of bipartisan efforts.
