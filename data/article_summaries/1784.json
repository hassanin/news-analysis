President Biden addressed the press in the Roosevelt Room and highlighted the positive news of the economy creating 336,000 jobs in September, bringing the total number of jobs created since he took office to 13.9 million. He emphasized the importance of job creation for the dignity and well-being of individuals and their families. The President noted that the unemployment rate has remained below 4% for 20 consecutive months, achieving record lows for women, African Americans, Hispanic workers, and people with disabilities. He attributed these achievements to his economic approach, which focuses on growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, rather than from the top down.

President Biden also discussed the celebration of National Manufacturing Day and the importance of investing in American workers and industries. He highlighted the creation of 815,000 manufacturing jobs since he took office, which is twice as many as the previous administration. The President mentioned the efforts to bring supply chains back to the United States and the investments in industries of the future.

Additionally, President Biden emphasized the importance of workers' rights to join and form unions. He mentioned the success of unionized workers in exercising their collective bargaining rights, particularly in the clean school bus program. The President referred to a recent report by the Treasury Department that highlighted the economic benefits of unions and collective bargaining.

President Biden expressed his frustration with House Republicans who threatened to jeopardize progress by pushing for extreme cuts in programs that support working Americans and seniors. He called for Congress to fund the government, avoid a shutdown, and protect the gains made by American workers. The President also criticized Republicans for prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations instead of reducing the deficit by ensuring they pay their fair share of taxes.

During the press conference, President Biden responded to questions about the possibility of a meeting with President Xi of China, his willingness to work with Congressman Jim Jordan if he becomes the next Speaker of the House, and his efforts to reappropriate border funds. He acknowledged the perception that people may not feel positive about the economy but attributed it to the nature of negative news coverage. Despite this, he believed that the American people are aware of their financial improvement and the positive state of the economy.
