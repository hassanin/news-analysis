The White House commends the Turkish government for imposing economic sanctions and other measures against the Syrian regime. This action shows Turkey's leadership in response to the brutality and violation of Syrian people's rights. The sanctions aim to isolate the Assad regime and send a strong message that their actions are unacceptable. The US calls on other governments to join in condemning and pressuring the Assad regime. President Obama has been working closely with Prime Minister Erdogan and will continue to do so in the future.
