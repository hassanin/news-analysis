President Trump held a press conference to announce four executive orders aimed at reducing the price of prescription drugs in the United States. The first order requires federal community health centers to pass on discounts they receive from drug companies on insulin and EpiPens directly to patients. The second order allows states, wholesalers, and pharmacies to import prescription drugs from countries where the prices are significantly lower. The third order targets middlemen in the pharmaceutical industry, requiring them to pass on discounts to Medicare patients. The fourth order aims to end the practice of foreign countries paying significantly less for the same drugs, and requires Medicare to pay the same price as other countries. The President also mentioned his administration's efforts to develop therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19.
