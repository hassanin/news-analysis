President Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Oregon due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement the state's recovery efforts. Federal funding is available for emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance, for all areas in Oregon impacted by COVID-19. Michael F. O'Hare has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
