According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), over $300 billion was repatriated to the U.S. in the first quarter, which is the highest amount on record. This surge in repatriation is due to the tax reform plan implemented by President Trump. Previously, U.S. firms would build factories overseas to avoid U.S. taxes, but they have now brought the money back to the U.S. because of the tax bill. In comparison, only $38 billion was repatriated during the same period last year. While it is unclear how the majority of the funds will be used, economists hope it will be used for hiring, increasing wages, and other measures that will benefit the American worker and the overall economy.
