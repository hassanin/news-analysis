The Presidential Memoranda issued on October 26, 2017, addresses the issue of combating the national drug demand and opioid crisis in the United States. The policy aims to use all lawful means to tackle the epidemic of drug abuse and overdose, including prescription opioids, heroin, and illicit synthetic opioids. The memorandum highlights the devastating impact of the crisis on individuals, families, and communities, with over 64,000 Americans dying from drug overdose in the previous year. The number of opioid-related deaths has surpassed those caused by motor vehicle accidents or gun-related incidents. The memorandum emphasizes the need for collaboration between federal, state, and local governments, law enforcement, medical professionals, and community organizations to address the crisis. Three key factors driving the opioid crisis are identified: the increase in opioid pain medication prescriptions, the influx of heroin from Mexico, and the illicit manufacture and importation of fentanyl from China. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is directed to consider declaring the crisis a Public Health Emergency, and other executive departments and agencies are instructed to utilize emergency authorities to reduce deaths and minimize the impact of the crisis on American communities. The memorandum concludes with general provisions, including the implementation of the memorandum in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
