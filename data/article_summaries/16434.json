The President applauds the Arab League's decisions to suspend Syria's membership, consider economic sanctions, and downgrade diplomatic relations.

The United States supports the Syrian people in their demand for universal rights and will continue to work with allies to pressure the Assad regime and support the pursuit of democracy.
