President Obama has declared a major disaster in North Dakota and authorized federal aid to support recovery efforts after a severe winter storm in October 2013. The funding will be available for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures. The affected counties include Adams, Bowman, Grant, Hettinger, Morton, Sioux, and Slope. Gary R. Stanley has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the area, and more designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
