The United States welcomes China's submission of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) towards a global climate agreement. This follows a target announced by China in 2014 and contributes to the momentum towards reaching a successful climate agreement in Paris. Almost 70% of global energy carbon-dioxide emissions are already being addressed by countries, and the United States encourages other major economies to submit their INDCs as soon as possible to ensure a successful outcome at the climate conference in Paris later this year.
