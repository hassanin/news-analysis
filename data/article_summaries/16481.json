President Barack Obama has proclaimed April 14, 2014, as Pan American Day and April 13 through April 19, 2014, as Pan American Week. This is a celebration of the birth of the International Union of American Republics, which later became the Organization of American States. The proclamation recognizes the strong connections between the United States and its American neighbors, including trade, educational exchanges, and cooperation in addressing global challenges. It emphasizes the shared ideals of democracy, human rights, open markets, and fair trade, and the importance of working together to advance peace and stability. The proclamation calls on the Governors of the 50 states, the Governor of Puerto Rico, and officials of other areas under the United States flag to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
