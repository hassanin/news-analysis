Dr. Jill Biden has arrived in Lusaka, Zambia as part of a three-country visit to Africa. She is joined by Rajiv Shah, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and Catherine Russell, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues. The purpose of Dr. Biden's trip is to highlight the importance of girls' education and women's participation in government, the economy, and civil society in promoting economic development, improving health and education, strengthening democratic governance, and fostering peace and security. During her time in Zambia, Dr. Biden will meet with Zambia's Second Lady, Dr. Charlotte Harland Scott, to discuss issues affecting women in the country, such as education, gender-based violence, health, and economic empowerment. She will also deliver remarks at Shalom Community School to emphasize U.S. programs and priorities in education, health, and women's empowerment. Additionally, Dr. Biden will open a panel discussion on the economic empowerment of women in Zambia, where few women hold positions of power. Before leaving Zambia, she will visit a local health facility to showcase the impact of partnerships between the U.S. government, the Zambian government, and local organizations in providing services for survivors of gender-based violence.
