On February 22, 2022, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, S. 566, designates a United States Postal Service facility in Slatersville, Rhode Island, as the Specialist Matthew R. Turcotte Post Office. The second bill, S. 583, is known as the "Promoting Rigorous and Innovative Cost Efficiencies for Federal Procurement and Acquisitions Act of 2021" or the "PRICE Act of 2021." This bill encourages the identification and promotion of best practices for acquisition techniques and procurement practices. The President expressed gratitude to Senators Reed, Whitehouse, Peters, Ernst, Carper, Collins, and Representatives Cicilline, Langevin, Neguse, and Salazar for their leadership in these initiatives.
