On November 3, 1997, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency with respect to Sudan due to the actions and policies of the Sudanese government. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Since then, several executive orders have been issued to address the threat posed by the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region. On January 13, 2017, the President determined that positive efforts by the Sudanese government had improved certain conditions, leading to the revocation of some executive orders. However, despite recent positive developments, the crisis caused by the actions and policies of the Sudanese government has not been resolved and continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Trump has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in 1997. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
