Dr. Jill Biden, the First Lady of the United States, visited the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle to discuss the Biden Cancer Moonshot initiative. The initiative aims to find better solutions, treatments, and cures for cancer, with the goal of making cancer a manageable disease rather than a death sentence. Dr. Biden emphasized the importance of catching cancer early and helping patients live longer and healthier lives. She praised the work being done at Fred Hutch, where researchers are focused on preventing breast cancer from recurring and metastasizing in survivors. Dr. Biden also highlighted the need for innovative research, quality care, and support for cancer survivors. She mentioned that there are currently 18 million cancer survivors in the US, and their numbers are growing thanks to advancements in research and care. Dr. Biden expressed hope for the future and called on everyone to continue their efforts to combat cancer. She emphasized the urgency of the situation and the need to work together to ensure that fewer families suffer the pain of losing a loved one to cancer. Dr. Biden concluded by thanking the staff at Fred Hutch for their work and promising to bring their insights and stories back to the White House.
