On August 4, 2014, the President signed into law H.J. Res. 76, which provides $225 million in emergency funding for the Secretary of Defense to give to the Government of Israel. This funding is specifically for the procurement of the Iron Dome defense system, which is used to counter short-range rocket threats. The goal is to ensure that Israel can continue producing Iron Dome components and maintain an adequate stockpile of interceptors and equipment. This funding is in addition to the $176 million requested in the President's FY 2015 budget and the $175 million proposed in Congress to offset the costs of initiating Iron Dome production in the United States. The United States takes pride in the Iron Dome system, which was developed in coordination with Israel and funded by the United States, as it has saved many Israeli lives. The continued bipartisan support for Iron Dome funding is important for Israel to have a vital defense against rockets and artillery. The United States supports Israel's right to defend itself against rocket attacks, but also urges Israeli authorities to take precautions to prevent civilian casualties in Gaza and protect the civilian Palestinian population. All parties involved in the conflict are expected to comply with international humanitarian law.
