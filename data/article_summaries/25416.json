President Donald Trump has signed two proclamations stating that measures are being taken to address the national security threat posed by steel and aluminum imports from Argentina, Brazil, and Australia. However, similar measures are not in place for imports from Mexico, Canada, or the European Union. As of June 1, 2018, tariffs will no longer be suspended for steel or aluminum imports from these countries. The Trump Administration will continue discussions with them and other countries, while also monitoring imports and adjusting measures as necessary to protect national security. The Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs have already had positive effects on workers and jobs in these industries.
