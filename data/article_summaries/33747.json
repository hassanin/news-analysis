The article discusses President Donald J. Trump's stance on immigration reform. Trump believes that real and positive immigration reform is possible if the focus is on improving jobs and wages for Americans, strengthening national security, and restoring respect for laws. The article also states that the Trump Administration is rescinding the previous Administration's memorandum creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and has begun to end the program responsibly. It argues that the DACA program was never intended to be permanent and that President Obama recognized that such unilateral actions were in excess of the Executive's appropriate role. The article concludes by stating that DACA made it difficult for President Trump to pursue the reforms needed to restore fairness to the immigration system and protect American workers.
