On October 4, 2019, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, S. 163, known as the "Alaska Remote Generator Reliability and Protection Act," revises the Standards for Performance for Stationary Compression Ignition Internal Combustion Engines. The purpose of this bill is to prevent catastrophic failure or shutdown of remote diesel power engines in Alaska due to malfunction of emission control technologies. 

The second bill, S. 1689, authorizes states to transfer funds from the Clean Water Revolving Fund to the Drinking Water Revolving Fund specifically for lead pipe abatement. This bill aims to address the issue of lead contamination in drinking water by allowing states to allocate funds for the removal of lead pipes.
