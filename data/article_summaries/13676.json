President Obama will host the 2014 White House Science Fair on May 27th to celebrate the student winners of various science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competitions from across the country. The President will also announce new steps as part of his Educate to Innovate campaign, which aims to inspire and support more girls and boys to excel in STEM subjects. This year's fair will have a specific focus on girls and women who are excelling in STEM and inspiring the next generation. Since the start of his presidency, President Obama has been dedicated to getting underrepresented groups, such as women and girls, interested in and succeeding in STEM fields. The President hosted the first-ever White House Science Fair in 2010 to fulfill his commitment to inspiring students to excel in math and science.
