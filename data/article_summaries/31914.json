On March 12, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum stating that the national emergency declared with respect to Iran in 1995 must continue beyond March 15, 2018. The President cited the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, including its development of ballistic missiles, support for international terrorism, and human rights abuses, as posing an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This national emergency was first declared in 1995 and has been renewed annually since then. The President's Memorandum states that the renewal is distinct from the emergency declared in 1979 in connection with the hostage crisis. The Memorandum will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
