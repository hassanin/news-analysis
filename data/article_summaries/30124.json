On Patriot Day, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation honoring the nearly 3,000 lives lost on September 11, 2001, and all the heroes who have sacrificed their lives since then to protect America's safety and freedom. The proclamation emphasizes that when America is united, no force can break it apart. It acknowledges the horrific attack carried out by radical Islamist terrorists 17 years ago, but also highlights the resilience, unity, and indomitable will of the American people. The proclamation pays tribute to the courage and selflessness displayed by countless individuals during and after the attacks, including the passengers and crew of United Flight 93, as well as the police, first responders, and volunteers who risked their lives to save others and help the nation recover. The proclamation designates September 11 as Patriot Day and calls for the flag of the United States to be displayed at half-staff. It also encourages community service, appropriate ceremonies, and a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor the victims of the terrorist attacks.
