On February 2, 2015, President Barack Obama issued a Sequestration Order for Fiscal Year 2016. The order states that direct spending budgetary resources for fiscal year 2016 in each non-exempt budget account will be reduced on October 1, 2015. The amount of reduction will be calculated by the Office of Management and Budget and specified in their report to Congress. All sequestrations must adhere to the requirements outlined in section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act and the specifications provided in the Office of Management and Budget's report.
