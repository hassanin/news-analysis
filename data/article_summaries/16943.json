President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Mississippi and ordered Federal aid to assist with recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding occurred from April 15 to April 28, 2011. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in several counties, including grants for housing and repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other recovery programs. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and hazard mitigation statewide. Terry L. Quarles has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by calling FEMA. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional assistance may be designated after assessments are completed.
