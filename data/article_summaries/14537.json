The President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness will be holding Listening and Action Sessions in Portland, Oregon and Dallas, Texas. These sessions aim to discuss how the public and private sectors can work together to create opportunities and support job creation. The sessions are part of a series of regional Council Listening and Action Sessions being held around the country. The ideas and information exchanged at these sessions will help inform the future policy work of the Council, which meets with President Obama each quarter to recommend steps to create jobs and strengthen the economy. The August 31st session in Portland will focus on addressing the engineering shortage in the country, while the September 1st session in Dallas will discuss the importance of infrastructure investment in creating jobs across different sectors of the American economy. The President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness was formed in January 2011 with the goal of bolstering the US economy through job creation, innovation, growth, and competitiveness. Its core mission is to promote growth by investing in American businesses, educating and training American workers, and attracting the best jobs and businesses to the United States.
