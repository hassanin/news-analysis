The United States has begun the process of relocating Afghan nationals who worked alongside American troops and diplomats in Afghanistan over the past two decades. The first flight of Operation Allies Refuge has arrived in the United States, carrying Afghans who are eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) and their families. These individuals have already undergone extensive background checks and security screening by the Intelligence Community and the Departments of State and Homeland Security. They will complete the final steps of their visa applications and medical checks at Fort Lee in Virginia before starting their new lives in the United States. The U.S. government expresses gratitude to those who have advocated for these Afghans, including veterans and the diplomatic community. Despite the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the United States will continue to support Afghanistan through security assistance, humanitarian aid, and development assistance. The U.S. government also calls for a reduction in violence in Afghanistan and urges all regional actors to support negotiations for a political settlement. The United States welcomes these brave Afghans and thanks them for their service.
