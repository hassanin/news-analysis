On Loyalty Day, President Biden emphasizes the importance of loyalty to the project of the United States and the democratic ideals embedded in the Constitution. Loyalty is not blindly following a leader or political party, but rather loyalty to common ideals and to one another as Americans. The nation is a diverse tapestry of cultures, religions, and languages, united by shared values and the commitment to perfecting the Union. Loyalty is seen in the members of the Armed Forces, educators, first responders, and those who strive to hold the nation accountable and push for freedom, justice, and equality. May 1 is also International Workers' Day, honoring essential workers and those who have fought for a fairer society. The Congress has designated May 1 as Loyalty Day to acknowledge patriotism and the sacrifices of citizens. President Biden calls upon the people to display the flag and pledge allegiance to the Republic.
