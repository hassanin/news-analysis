Steve Dettelbach, a career prosecutor with bipartisan support, is being considered for the position of leading the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). He has a track record of working closely with law enforcement, including ATF agents, to prosecute complex cases and combat gun violence and domestic terrorism. Dettelbach emphasizes the importance of keeping politics out of law enforcement. With the recent shootings and ongoing gun violence in various communities, there is a need for experienced leadership at the ATF to enforce gun laws and ensure community safety.
