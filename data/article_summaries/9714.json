This article announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the situation in Côte d'Ivoire. The national emergency was declared in 2006 due to the threat it posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The situation in Côte d'Ivoire has resulted in civilian massacres, human rights abuses, political violence, and attacks against peacekeeping forces. Although progress has been made in advancing democratic freedoms and economic development since President Alassane Ouattara took office in 2011, the situation still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2006 will continue for another year.
