This press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney on May 13, 2013, addresses various topics, including the IRS targeting scandal, Benghazi, the President's agenda, and immigration reform. Carney states that the White House Counsel's Office was only alerted in April 2013 about the IG's review of the IRS targeting. He emphasizes that the President finds the actions inappropriate and believes that people should be held accountable if the allegations are true. However, Carney highlights that the investigation is still ongoing and the White House is awaiting the IG's report before making any predictions or taking further action. Carney also mentions that there is currently no full commissioner at the IRS and that the President's focus remains on important issues such as the economy, job creation, and strengthening the middle class. He dismisses the Benghazi situation as a political sideshow and states that the President is committed to working with Congress on immigration reform. Regarding Secretary Sebelius raising money for Obamacare implementation, Carney mentions that the White House is focused on educating the American people about the benefits of the Affordable Care Act and implementing it. Finally, Carney addresses the call to stop deportations and states that the administration enforces immigration laws with appropriate prosecutorial discretion while working towards comprehensive immigration reform.
