In a recent statement from the Oval Office, President Biden congratulated Chairman Powell on his confirmation for a second term, along with Drs. Brainard and Cook and Jefferson. The President emphasized that his top priority is addressing inflation and transitioning from a historic recovery to steady growth for American families. He expressed his plan to address inflation by respecting the independence of the Federal Reserve and giving them the space they need to do their job. The Fed's responsibilities are focused on full employment and stable prices, and Chairman Powell and other leaders have a laser-focus on addressing inflation. With a larger complement of board members now confirmed, the President believes they will use monetary policy tools to address rising prices. President Biden expressed his support for Chairman Powell's continued leadership at the Fed and looks forward to the Senate considering his final nominee, Michael Barr, in the near future.
