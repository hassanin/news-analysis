Second Lady Karen Pence welcomed members of the Indiana World Organization of China Painters to the Vice President's Residence to thank them for their contribution to the nation's history. The artists painted 100 porcelain dessert plates, each decorated with a state flower. Two plates represent each of the 50 states, and the new plates will coordinate with the blue and gold Lenox china chosen by the Bidens. The winning artists were chosen based on their artwork, which was exhibited at the Indiana State Fair last summer. The Indiana World Organization of China Painters is a group of local guilds that meet monthly to share and promote the art of china painting. The organization is part of an international group of porcelain artists with headquarters and a museum in Oklahoma City.
