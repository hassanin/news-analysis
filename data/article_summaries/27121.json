On this day in 1782, General George Washington established the Badge of Military Merit, which later evolved into the Purple Heart. The Purple Heart is a distinguished military medal that symbolizes patriotism, honor, and courage. It is awarded to American service members who have displayed exceptional devotion to duty and sacrifice on the battlefield. Some recipients have lost their lives while defending the nation, while others have suffered life-changing injuries. Today, on the 236th anniversary of the Purple Heart, we honor the members of our Armed Forces for their service in protecting American democracy and freedom worldwide. We also express gratitude and support to military families who endure sacrifices and bear the burdens of loss. Melania Trump joins in thanking all those who have served and continue to serve our nation, and sends best wishes to those commemorating this day through special ceremonies and events.
