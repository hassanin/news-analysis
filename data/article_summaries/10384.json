President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Mississippi in response to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred in February 2013. This declaration allows federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in Forrest and Lamar Counties. Assistance may include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected area, and damage assessments are ongoing to determine if additional counties and forms of assistance will be designated. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
