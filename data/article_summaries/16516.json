The statement from White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer criticizes the Republican letter released, saying it does not provide a balanced approach. The statement argues that the Republican plan lowers rates for the wealthy and shifts the burden onto the middle class. It also claims that the plan lacks specifics on which deductions would be eliminated, which loopholes would be closed, and which Medicare savings would be achieved. Independent analysts have concluded that middle-class taxes would have to increase to fund lower rates for millionaires and billionaires. The President is willing to compromise for a significant, balanced deal but not on the principles of fairness and balance, which include asking the wealthiest to pay higher rates. President Obama believes that the economy grows best when it starts from the middle out, not from the top down. However, until Republicans in Congress are willing to ask the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates, a significant, balanced approach to reducing the deficit cannot be achieved.
