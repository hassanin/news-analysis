Last week, President Obama made progress in showing US leadership and building international consensus on two key priorities - Iran's nuclear program and global climate change. The IAEA Board of Governors sent a strong message against Iran's continued defiance, demanding that Tehran stop building its newly revealed nuclear facility and freeze uranium enrichment. Russia and China endorsed this rebuke, calling on Iran to take it seriously. On the issue of climate change, President Obama convinced key countries like China and India to pledge to take mitigation actions to reduce their carbon emissions. China announced that it will lower its carbon emissions relative to the size of its economy by as much as 45% by 2020, raising expectations for the Copenhagen summit on climate change.
