President Biden is taking bold actions to advance equality for LGBTQI+ individuals. He is addressing discriminatory legislative attacks by protecting LGBTQI+ children and families from attacks on their access to healthcare and education. He is also cracking down on the harmful practice of "conversion therapy" and charging the Department of Health and Human Services with leading an initiative to reduce youth exposure to this practice. Additionally, President Biden is safeguarding healthcare for LGBTQI+ patients and addressing the mental health crisis among LGBTQI+ youth. He is also supporting LGBTQI+ children and families by removing barriers and discrimination they face. The Executive Order includes additional steps to advance LGBTQI+ equality. This builds on the Biden-Harris Administration's historic progress in this area since taking office.
