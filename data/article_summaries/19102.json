The White House has proclaimed March 1-7, 2009, as National Consumer Protection Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of consumer education in helping individuals make informed decisions and protect themselves from fraud and abuse. The theme for this year's event is "Nuts & Bolts: Tools for Today's Economy," focusing on providing consumers with the basic information they need to navigate the marketplace. The Federal Trade Commission has organized a coalition of public- and private-sector organizations to provide practical tips on various topics, including home foreclosure, identity theft, and protecting businesses. The proclamation calls upon government officials, industry leaders, and advocates to provide citizens with information about consumer rights and encourages all Americans to play an active role in strengthening the economy.
