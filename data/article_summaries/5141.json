National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had a phone conversation with Philippine National Security Advisor Eduardo M. AÃ±o. Sullivan expressed U.S. support for the Philippines in response to the dangerous and illegal actions of the Chinese Coast Guard and maritime militia on October 22, which obstructed a routine Philippine resupply mission to Second Thomas Shoal. The two advisors reaffirmed the strong alliance and friendship between the United States and the Philippines and discussed upcoming engagements and ways to further strengthen the partnership. Sullivan emphasized the firm commitment of the U.S. alliance to the Philippines under the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty, which covers armed attacks on Philippine public vessels, aircraft, and armed forces, including the Coast Guard, in the Pacific region, including the South China Sea.
