President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Texas due to wildfires that occurred between April 6 and May 3, 2011. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available to governments and nonprofit organizations in certain counties on a cost-sharing basis for emergency protective measures. Kevin L. Hannes has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made later based on further damage assessments.
