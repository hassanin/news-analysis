The White House Press Secretary issued a statement on the introduction of the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015. The statement acknowledges that laws are being passed across the country that make it harder to vote, despite the significance of the Voting Rights Act as a crowning achievement of democracy. The statement calls on Congress to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act and protect the right to vote, which is essential to the foundation of the country. The Administration supports the efforts of Members of both the House and Senate in taking up this charge.
