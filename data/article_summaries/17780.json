Indonesia has announced its intention to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which has been welcomed by the President of the United States. This move is seen as a responsible leadership by Indonesia in the global effort to strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation regime. The President believes that this announcement, along with other nations' efforts, supports his vision of a world without nuclear weapons. Reinforcing the norm against nuclear testing is crucial in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and promoting peace and security. The United States is committed to ratifying the CTBT and will work with the Senate to achieve advice and consent for this international agreement. The United States also encourages all states to ratify the treaty and work towards its entry into force.
