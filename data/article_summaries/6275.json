On May 11, 2004, the President issued Executive Order 13338 declaring a national emergency in response to the actions of the Government of Syria. This national emergency has been modified and expanded over the years through various executive orders. The actions of the Syrian government, including supporting terrorism, occupying Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction, and undermining US and international efforts in Iraq, pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The brutality and repression of the Syrian people by the regime also generate instability in the region. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2004 must continue beyond May 11, 2022. The United States condemns the violence and human rights abuses by the Assad regime and its allies, and calls for a ceasefire, the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and a political settlement in Syria. The US will consider changes in Syria's policies and actions when determining whether to continue or terminate the national emergency in the future.
