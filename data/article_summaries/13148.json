The White House and U.S. Department of Education are launching this year’s Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) three months earlier than usual, on October 1st. This change will allow more students to access financial aid and better information when they need it. The Administration is also working to streamline the FAFSA and connect students and families with the College Scorecard and other resources to support them through college. The FAFSA will now allow students and families to automatically populate the form with last year’s tax information, making the process easier and more accurate. The College Scorecard provides information on cost, graduation rates, debt, and post-college earnings to help students and families choose a good-value school. The FAFSA will direct students to the College Scorecard next year. The Obama Administration has also made significant investments in financial aid, including increasing the maximum Pell Grant and establishing the American Opportunity Tax Credit. The federal government provides nearly $180 billion in financial aid, and over 160 million FAFSA forms have been completed since President Obama took office. The Administration is working with various organizations to ensure that students and families have access to better information and support in applying for financial aid and choosing a college. These efforts aim to break down barriers to college access and help more students succeed.
