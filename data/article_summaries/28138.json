On PTSD Awareness Day, the US government reaffirms its commitment to assisting and caring for those affected by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The government aims to ensure that individuals suffering from PTSD have access to the necessary resources and support to engage with their families and communities. PTSD symptoms include flashbacks, anxiety, stress hormone overexpression, sleep deprivation, and impaired communication. The government recognizes that PTSD is a life-threatening condition that can have a detrimental impact on families and relationships, as well as hinder daily life. Mental health and wellness are prioritized, with efforts made to provide evidence-based treatment and services for those with mental health conditions. A significant number of veterans also suffer from PTSD, and improving treatment is a crucial step in addressing this issue. Approximately half of the service members diagnosed with PTSD do not receive mental health treatment upon returning from combat. To combat this, an Executive Order was signed to enhance mental health services for recently discharged veterans, and the recently passed VA Mission Act aims to improve veterans' access to quality care. The government pledges to continue fighting the stigma associated with mental health by conducting research, providing access to evidence-based treatments, and offering love and support to improve the lives of those suffering from PTSD.
