President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Iowa due to severe storms and flooding that began on March 12, 2019. This declaration allows federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in several counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Timothy J. Scranton has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional areas may be designated for assistance as assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.
