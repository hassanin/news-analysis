First Lady Melania Trump visited Concord Hospital in New Hampshire to highlight the hospital's treatment programs for babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) as part of her Be Best initiative and in honor of Recovery Month. She toured the hospital's Simulation Center and met with hospital clinicians to discuss the care of babies with NAS and the implementation of the Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC) method. Melania also met with the therapeutics team who focus on providing alternative soothing therapies for infants, including a volunteer cuddler program. The First Lady concluded her visit by meeting with a mother and child who graduated from the hospital's treatment program. She also participated in a roundtable discussion with hospital leadership and staff. Melania's Be Best initiative aims to promote community resources for families affected by the opioid epidemic. She also made an off the record stop at Manchester Fire Department Central Station, which serves as a "Safe Station" for individuals seeking treatment for substance misuse disorder.
