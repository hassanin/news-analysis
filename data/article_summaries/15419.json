The White House has launched the nomination process for the 2012 Citizens Medal, which recognizes Americans who have performed exemplary acts of service for their country or fellow citizens. The President is inviting the public to nominate everyday heroes who have significantly impacted their communities but may not have received national attention. The nominees will be reviewed by White House staff, and the President will select the award recipients. Last year, over 6,000 nominations were received, and 13 individuals were awarded the Citizens Medal. Nominees must be US citizens and fulfill specific criteria. The Citizens Medal is considered the second highest civilian award in the US government.
