In a teleconference, a senior administration official announced that Russia has begun its invasion of Ukraine and the United States, along with its allies, has responded with swift and coordinated actions. The first tranche of sanctions includes blocking the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, fully blocking two major Russian financial institutions, cutting off the Russian government from U.S. financing, and sanctioning a group of Russian elites and their family members. The official emphasized that these sanctions are severe and the response will escalate further if Russia escalates. The official also mentioned that the goal is to prevent a large-scale invasion of Ukraine and to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian gas. The official stated that sanctions work over time and that export controls are also a potential tool in the toolkit. The official also mentioned that China cannot fully replace the U.S. and Europe as sources of financing for Russia.
