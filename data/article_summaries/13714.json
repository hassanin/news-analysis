This article is a notice from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Burma. On May 20, 1997, President Obama issued Executive Order 13047, certifying to Congress that the Government of Burma had committed large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 1996. This invoked the prohibition on new investment in Burma by United States persons. The President also declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed to national security and foreign policy by the actions and policies of the Government of Burma. This national emergency, along with the measures adopted to deal with it, must continue in effect beyond May 20, 2012, as the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The national emergency with respect to Burma is being continued for one year in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
