The article is a press briefing by Administration Officials on Recovery Act Tax Credits Available to American Families. The President will be announcing that as of the end of March, over $160 billion in tax relief has been provided to American families and businesses as a result of the Recovery Act. The primary beneficiaries of this tax relief are working families and small businesses. The President will also be highlighting a new interactive tool on the White House website that helps American families know all of the tax benefits they are eligible for.
