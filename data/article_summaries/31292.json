The Vice President of the United States, Michael Pence, recently visited the southern border and witnessed firsthand the humanitarian and national security emergency that is occurring. He claims that the crisis is driven by the loopholes in immigration laws that Congress has failed to address. Pence believes that Congress must act to close these loopholes in order to end the crisis.

One of the main issues is the federal asylum laws that encourage immigrants to try to cross the border illegally. In fiscal year 2018, there was a significant increase in the number of immigrants claiming credible fear after being stopped at the border. However, less than one out of ten of these immigrants receive asylum. This abuse of the immigration system is also fueled by the Flores settlement agreement, which limits the detention of minors crossing the border to 20 days. This results in law enforcement having to either separate families or release them into the United States.

Pence argues that these loopholes are contributing to the humanitarian and national security crisis at the southern border. He calls on Congress to change the asylum laws to raise the standard of proof for credible fear and extend the detention period for minors with their families. Ultimately, Pence believes that Congress must take action to address these loopholes in order to end the crisis.
