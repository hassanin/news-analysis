The Biden-Harris Administration has provided a status update on the actions taken under the National Security Memorandum on Combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing and Associated Labor Abuses (NSM-11) to address the problem of illegal fishing, protect ocean ecosystems, safeguard seafood supply chains, and combat forced labor abuses in the seafood industry. The implementation of NSM-11 has been strengthened through coordination with the U.S. Interagency Working Group on IUU Fishing, which includes various government agencies. IUU fishing is associated with forced labor and other human rights abuses, which undermine the livelihoods of fishers globally and have negative impacts on economic competitiveness, national security, and fishery sustainability. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to support multilateral and regional solutions that promote sustainable fishing. Partner engagement, capacity building, and resilience have been prioritized in the past year. Furthermore, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has proposed changes to the Seafood Import Monitoring Program (SIMP) to expand its coverage and improve its functioning. These actions demonstrate President Biden's commitment to combating IUU fishing, strengthening the economy, and preserving the health of the world's oceans.
