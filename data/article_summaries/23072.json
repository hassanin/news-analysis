President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama extend their best wishes to Muslim communities in the United States and around the world on the occasion of Ramadan. They acknowledge Ramadan as a time for self-reflection and devotion through prayer and fasting, as well as a time when Muslims reaffirm their commitment to helping the less fortunate. The President expresses gratitude to Muslim American organizations, individuals, and businesses for their efforts in reducing income inequality and poverty through charitable work and initiatives to empower students, workers, and families. He emphasizes the shared responsibility to treat others with respect and dignity, and highlights the principles that bind people of different faiths together. The President also mentions the importance of pursuing justice, peace, and upholding the dignity of every human being, especially in a world where conflict and violence continue to cause suffering. As in previous years, President Obama looks forward to hosting Muslim Americans at the White House for an iftar dinner, expressing appreciation for their contributions to the country and wishing Muslims worldwide a blessed month of family, community, peace, and understanding.
