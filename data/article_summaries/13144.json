The White House has announced details of President Obama's plan to provide Americans with job training and employment services. The plan includes a streamlined re-employment system that will reach up to a million displaced workers per year and better connect workers and businesses with employment services in their communities. The proposal aims to provide support to all workers who have lost their jobs, regardless of the circumstances. It also calls for the creation of an American Job Center network to unify all federally-supported One-Stop Career Centers and electronic resources. The President's budget proposes a $50 million investment to improve and expand these workforce centers. Additionally, the plan includes the Universal Displaced Worker Program, which will provide displaced workers with job-search assistance, training awards, support for pursuing training or looking for work, and wage insurance for older workers. The President's goal is to create an economy where everyone has opportunities to advance and hard work pays off.
