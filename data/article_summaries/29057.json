The article discusses how Poland is looking to reduce its reliance on Russian energy by signing a five-year deal to buy American liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the state-owned oil and gas company, PGNiG. This illustrates how the energy boom from the fracking revolution in the US can serve national interests and deter the reach of dictators abroad. The US has become the world's top natural gas producer, surpassing Russia in 2015. Under the deal, British utility Centrica will deliver up to nine cargos of LNG for Polish consumption, which it buys from Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana. By offering an alternative to Russian energy, the US empowers its European allies and weakens the Kremlin's coercive regional influence.
