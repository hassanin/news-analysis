President Biden and Vice President Harris have prioritized rebuilding the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, rather than the top down. Despite facing immediate challenges such as the pandemic, unemployment, and struggling small businesses, they recognized the need for long-term solutions to address inequality and disinvestment in communities. President Biden's approach, known as Bidenomics, rejects failed trickle-down policies and focuses on three key pillars. While there is still work to be done, Bidenomics has already shown positive results for the American people, including Black Americans.
