The Small Business Administration (SBA) has released a new report highlighting the success of the Community Navigator Program in helping traditionally underserved businesses. The program, funded by the American Rescue Plan, aims to reduce barriers for small businesses owned by disadvantaged groups such as veterans, women, and those from rural communities and communities of color. Through competitive funding, the program has partnered with 51 organizations to connect entrepreneurs with resources and support to recover and thrive. The SBA analysis shows that the program has been successful in closing resource, capital, and educational gaps for underserved businesses by connecting them with culturally competent service providers. President Biden has called for an extension of funding for the program beyond 2023. Business owners who have participated in the program shared how it helped them secure funding, navigate certification and procurement processes, and receive specialized technical assistance. Participants expressed their commitment to continue providing these services in the future.
