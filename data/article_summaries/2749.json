On Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day, President Biden recognizes the epidemic of missing or murdered Indigenous people in Indian Country. These cases often go unsolved, leaving families to investigate on their own and demand justice. To address this crisis, the Department of the Interior has created a new unit to speed up investigations, and federal agencies have been tasked with collecting better data and developing a strategy to combat the issue. The United States Attorneysâ€™ Offices operating in Indian Country will prioritize addressing the crisis, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has dedicated personnel for missing and murdered Indigenous cases. The Departments of Justice and Interior are coordinating efforts to investigate and prosecute these crimes using trauma-informed and culturally responsive approaches. Additionally, the Violence Against Women Act has been strengthened to expand Tribal courts' jurisdiction over non-Native perpetrators. The government is investing in shelters, rape crisis centers, housing, legal assistance, and trauma-informed training to address the underlying causes of violence. The administration is working with Indigenous survivors, victims' families, Tribal leaders, and international partners to combat the epidemic and support healing. President Biden proclaims May 5, 2023, as Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day and calls on all Americans and levels of government to support Tribal communities' efforts in addressing the issue.
