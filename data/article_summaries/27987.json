In this statement, the President of the United States discusses the need to address concerns regarding foreign countries' systematic investment in US companies and assets to obtain cutting-edge technologies and intellectual property. The President mentions the progress made by Congress in passing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA), which aims to enhance the protection of critical technologies from harmful foreign acquisitions. The President expresses support for this legislation and states that upon enactment, his administration will promptly implement and enforce it. However, if Congress fails to pass strong FIRRMA legislation, the President will deploy new tools under existing authorities to protect American technology and intellectual property globally. The President also directs the Secretary of Commerce to lead an examination of issues related to the transfer and export of critical technologies, with the goal of strengthening export controls to defend national security and technological leadership. The Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, and the United States Trade Representative are also instructed to engage with allies and partners to combat technology transfer and intellectual property theft. The President applauds Congress for its progress and urges them to send a strong bill as soon as possible to protect America's security and prosperity.
