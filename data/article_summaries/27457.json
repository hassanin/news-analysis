On March 11, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding healthcare and the response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency. The memorandum emphasizes the need to prepare for and respond to public health threats, including COVID-19. It states that healthcare providers must have access to the necessary products to address the epidemic. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has taken action to bring these products to healthcare providers across the country. However, there are concerns about shortages of personal respiratory devices (respirators) for healthcare workers. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, the memorandum directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take necessary steps to facilitate the emergency use of general use respirators by healthcare personnel. The Secretary of Labor is also instructed to consider steps to increase the availability of respirators. The memorandum concludes by authorizing and directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish it in the Federal Register.
