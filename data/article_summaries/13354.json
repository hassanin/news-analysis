The White House has issued a notice to continue the national emergency with respect to Yemen. This national emergency was declared in 2012 due to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Yemen and others that threatened Yemen's peace, security, and stability. These actions continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The national emergency will remain in effect for another year.
