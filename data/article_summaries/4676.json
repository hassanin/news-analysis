During a press call, White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona announced the launch of the Savings on a Valuable Education Plan (SAVE Plan), an income-driven repayment plan for student loans. The plan calculates payments based on a borrower's income and family size, and forgives remaining balances after a certain number of years. It aims to make college more affordable and reduce the burden of student debt. The plan is available to all borrowers with loans held by the Department of Education, and the maximum repayment period is 20 years for undergraduates and 25 years for graduate students. The administration is also launching a nationwide outreach campaign to enroll as many borrowers as possible in the SAVE Plan. Borrowers can apply for the plan through the Department of Education's website, and the goal is to process applications within four weeks.
