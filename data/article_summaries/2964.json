The President of the United States, along with other leaders from the G7, has launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. The aim of this partnership is to provide financing for sustainable infrastructure projects in developing and middle-income countries. The United States has committed to mobilizing $200 billion in public and private capital over the next five years for this initiative. The goal is to mobilize nearly $600 billion from the G7 by 2027. The areas of focus for these strategic investments include health and health security, digital connectivity, gender equality and equity, and climate and energy security. Examples of projects already underway include a vaccine manufacturing facility in Senegal, secure network equipment in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and clean energy projects in Angola and Romania. The President emphasized that this is not charity but rather an investment that will benefit all participating nations and boost their economies.
