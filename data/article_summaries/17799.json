The agreement aims to open up Panama's market and eliminate barriers to U.S. goods, services, and investment.

Upon implementation, Panama will immediately eliminate tariffs on a significant portion of U.S. exports, with most other duties being phased out over a 15-year period. The agreement also includes provisions to protect intellectual property rights, reduce regulatory red tape, and enforce labor and environmental laws.
