President Donald J. Trump has released $50 million in stabilization assistance for Syria to protect persecuted ethnic and religious minorities and advance human rights. The funding will provide emergency financial assistance to Syrian human rights defenders, civil society organizations, and reconciliation efforts supporting ethnic and religious minority victims of the conflict. It will also be used for increased accountability, removal of explosive remnants of war, community security, documenting human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, and support for survivors of gender-based violence and torture. The administration hopes that regional and international partners will continue to contribute to these efforts, as ensuring the freedom and safety of ethnic and religious minorities remains a top priority.
