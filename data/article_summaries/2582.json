During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced the launch of the Low-Income Household Water Assistance Program, which aims to expand access to affordable water and help low-income households affected by the COVID-19 pandemic pay their water bills. The program will make $166.6 million immediately available to grantees, with a total of $1.1 billion available through grants. Psaki also previewed President Biden's remarks for his upcoming announcement of a month of action to increase COVID-19 vaccinations. The President will mobilize community leaders, businesses, celebrities, and volunteers to participate in a nationwide campaign to get more people vaccinated by July 4th. The administration will make it easier to get vaccinated by offering vaccines at various locations such as barber shops, baseball games, and pharmacies that will be open 24 hours on Fridays. Psaki also mentioned the administration's efforts to address the increased threat of ransomware attacks, including working with the private sector, building an international coalition, expanding cryptocurrency analysis, and reviewing ransomware policies. The President will discuss these issues with Russian President Putin at their upcoming summit. Psaki also addressed questions about the filibuster, student loan forgiveness, and the President's view on the recent Texas voting rights legislation.
