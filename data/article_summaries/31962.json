The Trump Administration is concerned about Iran's decision to return 81-year-old Baquer Namazi, a United States citizen, to Evin Prison after briefly releasing him on bail for a medical examination. The decision was made against the advice of his doctors and the Iranian regime's own medical examiner. Namazi is serving a 10-year sentence on false charges and has been hospitalized four times in the past year due to life-threatening heart problems. The United States holds Iran responsible for his well-being and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all unjustly detained and missing U.S. citizens in Iran, including Namazi, his son Siamak Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and Robert Levinson.
