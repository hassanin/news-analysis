President Biden has taken historic measures to reduce gun violence through executive action and legislation. The Biden Administration has implemented more executive actions to address gun violence than any other president at this point in their administration. They are celebrating the passing of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which is the most significant gun violence reduction legislation in 30 years. The administration is committed to using all available tools to combat gun violence and has proposed a budget of $32 billion for crime-fighting efforts, including funding for law enforcement and crime prevention programs. President Biden is urging Congress to take further legislative action, such as banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, strengthening background checks, and enacting safe storage laws. The administration has already taken 21 executive actions to make communities safer, including measures to regulate ghost guns, improve firearm stabilizing brace regulations, and publish model extreme risk protection order legislation. They have also launched law enforcement strike forces, implemented public awareness campaigns, and created plans for lethal means safety awareness. Additionally, the administration has encouraged the use of funding from the American Rescue Plan to invest in community violence interventions and prevention, made changes to programs to support violence intervention efforts, and provided grants to law enforcement. They are also addressing the root causes of gun violence through programs that provide opportunities for young people, assist formerly incarcerated individuals in transitioning to the workforce, and support survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.
