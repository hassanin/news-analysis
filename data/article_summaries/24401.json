This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Belarus. The national emergency was initially declared in 2006 due to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other individuals undermining Belarus's democratic processes and institutions. The government has been accused of human rights abuses, political repression, and public corruption. Despite the government's crackdown on political opposition, civil society, and independent media, it has not shown progress in democratic governance and respect for human rights. As a result, the national emergency and measures adopted to address it will continue for another year.
