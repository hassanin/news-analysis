The United States has prioritized providing military capabilities to Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression. This includes weapons from the US as well as capabilities from allies and partners. The effectiveness of these weapons has been demonstrated in repelling the Russian attack on Kyiv and damaging the Russian military. The Slovakian government has provided an S-300 air defense system to Ukraine, and in return, the US will reposition a Patriot missile system to Slovakia for its security. The US will continue to support Ukraine with advanced weapons to defend against further Russian aggression.
