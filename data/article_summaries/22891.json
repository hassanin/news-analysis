This article is a transcript of a press briefing by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. Carney discusses the President's calls with Speaker of the House John Boehner and Majority Leader Harry Reid regarding the need to extend the payroll tax cut. Carney emphasizes the importance of passing the bipartisan compromise that was supported by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, and urges the House leadership to allow a vote on the bill. He also highlights the negative impact that failing to extend the tax cut would have on middle-class families and the economy. Carney expresses optimism that a year-long extension can be achieved, but emphasizes the need to pass the two-month extension in the meantime. He also addresses questions about Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.
