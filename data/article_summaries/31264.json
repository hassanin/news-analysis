In this article, President Donald Trump proclaims May 18, 2018, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 13 through May 19, 2018, as National Transportation Week. He highlights the importance of transportation infrastructure in the growth and defense of the United States. Trump acknowledges that the country's infrastructure has fallen behind due to political inaction, poor resource allocation, and a broken permitting process. He proposes an infrastructure plan that aims to generate a $1.5 trillion investment into the country's infrastructure. The plan includes rebuilding roads and bridges, creating incentives for state and local investments, and focusing on eliminating redundancies and inefficiencies in regulatory and permitting procedures. Trump emphasizes the importance of a highly functioning infrastructure network for the military and rural America. He encourages Americans to celebrate these observances and learn more about how transportation contributes to the security and prosperity of the nation.
