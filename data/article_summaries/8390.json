President Biden, a long-time supporter of Israel, believes that significant changes in a democracy should ideally have broad consensus. He expressed disappointment that the recent vote in Israel took place with only a narrow majority. However, talks are ongoing and expected to continue in the coming weeks and months to reach a broader compromise, even during the Knesset recess. The United States will continue to support President Herzog and other Israeli leaders as they work towards building consensus through political dialogue.
