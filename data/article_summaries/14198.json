In this op-ed, Attorney General Eric Holder and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius defend the Affordable Care Act against recent lawsuits challenging its constitutionality. They highlight the case of a woman who was able to receive treatment for lymphoma through a temporary program provided by the law, and emphasize the importance of the individual responsibility provision, which requires Americans to maintain basic health coverage. They argue that without this provision, costs would increase for everyone with health insurance and discrimination against people with preexisting conditions would persist. They also address the legal arguments made against the law, stating that the Constitution allows Congress to adopt rules to address harmful economic effects, and that similar challenges to laws such as Social Security and civil rights protections have failed in the past. They conclude by urging opponents of the law to work with them to effectively implement it, expressing confidence that it will ultimately be upheld in court.
