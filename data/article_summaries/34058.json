Since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), American companies have announced wage increases, bonuses, retirement account contributions, and plans for investment in workers and equipment. Over 350 companies have made these intentions public, announcing over $150 billion in investments and $4.2 billion in bonuses for over 4 million workers. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that the total increase in annual wages and salaries resulting from tax reform will reach $4,000 per household. The tax cuts have made US tax rates more competitive, attracting companies to invest in the country and boosting workers' productivity. Additionally, dozens of American utilities have announced intentions to reduce rates, resulting in lower monthly electric and/or gas bills for nearly 30 million customers.
