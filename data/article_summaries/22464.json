This article is a fact sheet that highlights the United States and India's commitment to collaborating on climate change, clean energy, energy security, and environmental stewardship. The two countries are working together to bring the Paris Agreement into force as quickly as possible and to adopt an amendment to phase-down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). They are also focusing on addressing greenhouse gas emissions from international civil aviation and promoting access to off-grid solar power through the International Solar Alliance. 

In terms of clean energy, the United States and India are cooperating on various initiatives such as rooftop solar, grid integration, solar resource data enhancement, and new investments. They aim to deploy 175 gigawatts of renewable energy in India by 2022, and the United States has announced 5.4 GW of new commitments from US renewable companies for investment in India. The two countries are also working on clean energy finance initiatives, including the creation of a Clean Energy Finance Hub and the mobilization of climate finance for Indian solar projects.

The article also mentions bilateral climate cooperation, including the Fulbright-Kalam Climate Fellowship and the Partnership for Climate Resilience. The United States and India are working together to reduce urban population exposure to air pollution, cooperate on reducing GHG emissions from heavy-duty vehicles, and enhance energy security through collaboration on gas hydrates and refinery environmental sustainability. Finally, the leaders of both countries emphasize the importance of environmental stewardship, particularly in areas like oceans and wildlife conservation.
