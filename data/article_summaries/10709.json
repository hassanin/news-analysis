President Obama has announced the winner of the new Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute competition, which will focus on developing smart sensors for advanced manufacturing. The institute, based in Los Angeles, brings together a consortium of nearly 200 partners from academia, industry, and non-profits to improve the efficiency of U.S. advanced manufacturing. The Obama Administration has also launched five new manufacturing hub competitions, which will invest nearly $800 million in transformative manufacturing technologies. These competitions aim to support robotics in manufacturing environments, advanced tissue biofabrication, modular chemical process intensification, reducing embodied energy and decreasing emissions in materials manufacturing, and industry-proposed institutes. The Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute will partner with three existing manufacturing innovation institutes to pioneer technologies at the intersection of their unique capabilities. The institute will also launch five regional manufacturing centers across the United States to focus on technology transfer and workforce development. The goal is to make the manufacturing sector more competitive and sustainable.
