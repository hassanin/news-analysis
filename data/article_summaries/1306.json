Yesterday, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, and U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy met with health system and hospital leaders to discuss the importance of taking aggressive action this fall to protect patients, healthcare workers, and communities from COVID-19 and the flu. The officials emphasized that although progress has been made in combating COVID-19, there is still more work to be done before winter, when contagious diseases can spread more rapidly. They highlighted the significant surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths during the past two winters, which strained the healthcare system, and emphasized that this does not have to happen again this year if everyone plays their part. The meeting focused on the steps hospitals and health systems can take to ensure that all Americans, including healthcare workers, receive their updated COVID-19 vaccines and encourage people to get tested and seek treatment when sick. The officials stressed that these measures will save lives, reduce the burden on the healthcare system, minimize disruptions to daily life, and effectively manage COVID-19 in the U.S. The meeting also addressed the gratitude for frontline healthcare workers and acknowledged the physical, emotional, and mental toll that the virus has had on them, emphasizing the importance of addressing healthcare worker burnout.
