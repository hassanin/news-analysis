The article discusses the changes to asylum rules made by the Trump administration. Under the new rule, migrants who pass through another country will be ineligible for US asylum unless they have first sought it unsuccessfully in that third country. The article argues that this rule makes sense because if migrants are already safe in another country, they should apply for asylum there before coming to the United States. It also mentions that the US immigration courts currently have a backlog of 900,000 cases and are being overwhelmed. The article states that US asylum laws are often abused, with many migrants coming to the US for economic reasons rather than out of fear. Despite the lax asylum rules, the courts still deny 80% of the requests eventually, but the backlog means that this process can take years. As a result, many applicants have families, jobs, and obligations in the US and end up staying even if their asylum requests are denied. The article concludes by stating that these factors make US borders virtually meaningless and undermine the law.
