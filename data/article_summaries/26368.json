President Donald Trump has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House, requesting additional appropriations for Fiscal Year 2017. The request includes $30 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) to rebuild the U.S. Armed Forces and accelerate the campaign against ISIS, and an additional $3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for urgent border protection activities. The DOD funding would address critical budget shortfalls in personnel, training, maintenance, equipment, munitions, modernization, and infrastructure investment. The request also includes $5.1 billion for DOD's Overseas Contingency Operations budget to accelerate the campaign against ISIS. The DHS funding would be used to plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, increase immigration detention capacity, and hire additional immigration law enforcement officers and agents. The President recommends that non-defense discretionary reductions of $18 billion be enacted to offset the proposed amounts for DHS and half of the proposed amounts for DOD. The details of the proposal are outlined in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
