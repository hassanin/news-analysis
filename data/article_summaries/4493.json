On June 16, 2022, the President signed into law the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022, known as S. 3580. This act authorizes appropriations for the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) for fiscal years 2022 through 2025. It also introduces additional requirements and prohibited conduct for ocean carriers, such as rules related to fee assessments, prohibited practices, and the establishment of a shipping registry. Furthermore, the act grants the FMC the authority, under specific circumstances, to issue an emergency order mandating common carriers to share information directly with shippers, rail, and motor carriers. The article acknowledges the leadership of Senators Amy Klobuchar, John Thune, Maria Cantwell, and Roger Wicker, as well as Representatives Peter DeFazio, Sam Graves, John Garamendi, and Dusty Johnson in the development and passage of this legislation.
