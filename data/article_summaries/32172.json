The United States has condemned the Iranian regime's rocket attacks on Israeli citizens from Syria and expressed strong support for Israel's right to self-defense. The deployment of offensive rocket and missile systems by Iran in Syria aimed at Israel is seen as a highly dangerous development for the entire Middle East. The responsibility for the consequences of these actions lies with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and the United States calls on the IRGC and its proxies, including Hizballah, to refrain from further provocations. Additionally, the United States urges all nations to acknowledge the severe threat to international peace and stability posed by the Iranian regime's actions.
