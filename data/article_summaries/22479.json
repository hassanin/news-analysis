This article is a notice from the White House, stating that the national emergency with respect to Yemen, which was declared in 2012, will continue for another year. The emergency was declared due to the actions and policies of certain members of the Yemeni government and others, which threatened Yemen's peace, security, and stability. The continuation of the national emergency is necessary because these threats still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The notice was issued by President Barack Obama.
