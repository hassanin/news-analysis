President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared in Executive Order 12170 in 1979, will continue beyond November 14, 2015. The letter explains that relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal and the process of implementing agreements with Iran is still ongoing. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
