The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced the third phase of grants for the Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program for Fiscal Year 2020. The grants include funding for 107 new coalitions and 94 coalitions that receive an additional 5 years of funding. The new coalitions received approximately $25 million in funding, marking the highest number of DFC coalitions admitted in one year since the program started. In total, the Trump Administration has announced support for 733 DFC coalitions, representing approximately $91.5 million in funding. The ONDCP Director, Jim Carroll, stated that the investment in prevention is at an all-time high under the Trump Administration. The DFC Program provides grants to community coalitions to address local youth substance use issues. The program engages multiple sectors of the community and uses various strategies to reduce youth substance use. The day-to-day management of the DFC Program is now being performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.
