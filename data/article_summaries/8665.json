The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Biden, aims to address the climate crisis and improve the economy for working families, including Tribal nations and Native communities. The act lowers prescription drug costs, healthcare costs, and energy costs. It includes specific provisions to support Tribal nations in planning for climate change, adapting to its impacts, and transitioning to clean energy. The act also reduces climate pollution, advances environmental justice, and makes energy efficiency upgrades more affordable. It supports farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners in addressing the climate crisis. Additionally, the act lowers healthcare costs, expands health insurance coverage, and makes the tax code fairer by raising revenue and ensuring that working families receive their entitled benefits. No family making less than $400,000 per year will see their taxes increase.
