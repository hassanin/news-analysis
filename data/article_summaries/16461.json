On October 24, 2012, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation recognizing United Nations Day. This day commemorates the founding ideals of the United Nations and reaffirms commitments to peace building, human rights, and social progress. The United Nations Charter reflects the belief that the world is more secure when the global community acts collectively. The United States, along with its global partners, stands for the aspirations of all people to determine their future and seek their own destiny. The proclamation urges the observation of United Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
