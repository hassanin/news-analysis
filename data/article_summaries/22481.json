The White House has announced the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) in response to the growing epidemic in the United States. Approximately 56,000 people become infected with HIV each year, and over 1.1 million Americans are currently living with HIV. The NHAS aims to reduce the number of new infections, increase access to care and optimize health outcomes for people living with HIV, and reduce HIV-related health disparities. The strategy calls for aggressive efforts to educate Americans about the dangers of HIV and the steps they can take to protect themselves and their loved ones. $30 million from the Affordable Care Act's Prevention Fund will be dedicated to implementing the NHAS, supporting the development of prevention interventions, improved surveillance, expanded testing, and other activities. The NHAS Federal Implementation Plan outlines key actions to be taken by the federal government, and a Presidential Memorandum directs agencies to implement the strategy. The Obama Administration has engaged the public through community discussions and expert meetings to gather input and strengthen the national response to the epidemic.
