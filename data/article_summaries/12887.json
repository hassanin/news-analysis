Vice President Biden has announced new initiatives to help homeowners, veterans, and workers access legal services. The actions include strengthening foreclosure mediation programs, helping veterans secure legal help, and making it easier for workers to find qualified attorneys. The Department of Labor and the American Bar Association will collaborate to help workers resolve complaints, and the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Legal Services Corporation will launch an awareness campaign to help veterans with legal challenges. The initiatives aim to ensure that all Americans have access to the resources they need to pursue justice.
