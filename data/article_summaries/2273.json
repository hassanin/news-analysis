One year ago, President Biden announced two initiatives to help Black families and communities build wealth through homeownership and entrepreneurship. The first initiative aims to address bias in the home appraisal process, which limits the ability of Black and brown families to benefit from homeownership. The Biden-Harris Administration released the PAVE Action Plan, which includes more than 20 commitments to advance equity in the appraisal process. These commitments include making the appraisal industry more accountable, providing assistance to consumers who receive lower-than-expected valuations, preventing algorithmic bias, and promoting diversity in the appraiser profession.

The second initiative focuses on advancing equity in federal procurement. Increasing federal spending with underserved businesses can help narrow wealth disparities. The Biden-Harris Administration has implemented reforms to increase the share of federal contracts given to socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) and provide more opportunities for underserved businesses. These actions aim to address the wealth gap between average white and Black households, where differences in business ownership account for 20% of the disparity.
