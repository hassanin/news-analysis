During a press briefing aboard Air Force One en route to Detroit, Michigan, White House Deputy Press Secretary Chris Meagher provided updates on various topics. He highlighted the progress in vaccinating 5- to 11-year-olds against COVID-19, with approximately 2.6 million children in this age group being protected so far. Meagher also emphasized the importance of getting children vaccinated before the holidays and discussed the President's visit to General Motors' Factory ZERO in Detroit. The President's visit to the factory will focus on the role of Detroit and union auto workers in the electric vehicle industry and America's competitiveness in the global market. Meagher also addressed questions about the move by House Democrats to censure Paul Gosar, concerns raised by Canada regarding tax incentives for American-made electric vehicles, and the President's letter to the Federal Trade Commission regarding rising gas prices. He also discussed the administration's approach to filling vacancies in government positions, the opioid epidemic, and the lifting of mask mandates in certain cities.
