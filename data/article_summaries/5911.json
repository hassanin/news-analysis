In recognition of National Child Abuse Prevention Month, President Joe Biden emphasizes the importance of addressing child abuse in all its forms. He highlights the negative impact of abuse on a child's life, including their education and relationships. Prevention is emphasized as a crucial tool to break the cycle of abuse and ensure children grow up in safe and healthy environments. The administration is committed to providing support to families in need, with initiatives like the American Rescue Plan and additional funding for child abuse prevention programs. The president also acknowledges the need to address inequities experienced by historically underserved communities. He condemns attempts to weaponize the child welfare system against families supporting transgender children and affirms the importance of affirming a transgender child's identity. The Department of Health and Human Services has released new guidance to support LGBTQI+ children in foster care. The month is a call for everyone to unite against child abuse, honor the child-welfare workforce, and recognize the strength of adult survivors of abuse.
