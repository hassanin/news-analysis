This executive order, issued on April 10, 2019, aims to streamline the process for reviewing and issuing Presidential permits for cross-border infrastructure projects in the United States. The order states that previous actions, regulations, and policies have unnecessarily complicated the permitting process, hindering economic development and international relations. The Secretary of State is designated to receive and review permit applications within 60 days, with the ability to request additional information and seek input from relevant agencies, governments, and officials. Ultimately, the decision to issue, deny, or amend a permit rests solely with the President. Existing permits issued under previous orders remain in effect unless modified or revoked. The order also clarifies that it does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies or the functions of the Office of Management and Budget. Furthermore, it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
