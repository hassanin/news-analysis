The President has signed an Executive Order establishing a Council of Governors to strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and State Governments in protecting the nation against hazards. The Council will review matters involving the National Guard, homeland defense, civil support, and the synchronization and integration of State and Federal military activities. It will be composed of ten State Governors selected by the President for two-year terms, with no more than five members from the same party. Federal members of the Council include the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other officials. The Council will serve as a forum for exchanging views on strengthening national resilience and addressing homeland defense and civil support challenges. The formation of the Council was mandated by the Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.
