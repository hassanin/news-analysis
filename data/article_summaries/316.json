The Biden-Harris Administration is implementing new measures to conserve and restore America's mature and old-growth forests. These forests play a vital role in providing clean water, absorbing carbon pollution, and supplying habitat for wildlife. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is proposing to amend all 128 forest land management plans across the country to conserve and restore old-growth forests, marking the first nationwide forest plan amendment by the Forest Service. Additionally, the Forest Service is updating the Northwest Forest Plan for climate resilience, which guides the management of federally-managed forests in Washington, Oregon, and California. The USDA's Forest Service and the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management together manage approximately 112 million acres of old growth and mature forests on federal lands. These actions are part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to address climate change, conservation, and restoration. Other initiatives include a nationwide inventory of old and mature forests, proposed rules for national forest and grassland climate resilience, collaborative efforts to conserve pinyon-juniper ecosystems, implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, repealing the 2020 Alaska Roadless Rule to protect the Tongass National Forest, reforestation targets and assessments, reporting on international deforestation, and grants for urban and community forestry.
