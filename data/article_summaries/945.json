President Joseph R. Biden has proclaimed October 2023 as National Youth Substance Use Prevention Month in an effort to build a better future for America's children. The opioid epidemic and overdose crisis have led to the loss of thousands of lives, including children and adolescents. The President's Unity Agenda includes addressing the opioid epidemic as a key pillar. The administration has invested over $169 billion in drug control policies and programs, with a focus on expanding evidence-based prevention programs for youth. Efforts are being made to hire and train more mental health counselors and professionals in schools, provide resources to prevent substance use and overdoses, and facilitate Medicaid billing for health services in schools. The administration is also supporting Drug-Free Communities coalitions in all 50 states and has launched a social media campaign to educate youth about the dangers of illicit fentanyl and the use of opioid-reversal medications. In terms of access to treatment, the administration has proposed new actions to strengthen coverage for mental health and substance use disorders, ensuring that more than 150 million Americans with private health insurance can better access treatment. The President's Fiscal Year 2024 budget includes a significant increase in funding for prevention programming for youth. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of protecting and providing resources for young people, who are considered the most gifted and talented generation in American history.
