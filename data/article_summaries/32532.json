The American Workforce Policy Advisory Board has been created by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Ivanka Trump to work with the National Council for the American Worker. The board, which includes chief executives from Apple, Lockheed Martin, and Walmart, aims to develop job training programs to meet the changing demands of U.S. employers. Ivanka Trump stated that the board's goal is to ensure inclusive growth and provide all Americans with the skills and opportunities for good paying jobs. The board will help develop a national campaign to promote education and training, improve labor market data, increase private sector investments in job learning, and identify companies' hiring needs.
