President Trump and Prime Minister Abe of Japan announced that they have reached an agreement in principle on a trade deal. The deal includes provisions on agriculture, e-commerce, and other areas, and is worth billions of dollars. As part of the agreement, Japan will be buying excess corn from the United States to support American farmers. The two leaders plan to sign the agreement around the time of the U.N. General Assembly meeting. The deal is seen as a significant boost for American farmers and will have positive impacts on both the Japanese and American economies. The details of the agreement still need to be finalized at the working level. Additionally, it was mentioned that auto tariffs will remain in place for both China and Japan. There was no comment from President Trump regarding reports of the Iranian Foreign Minister attending the meeting in Biarritz.
