On World Refugee Day, the President acknowledges the challenges faced by refugees and honors their courage and resilience. The UN reports that more people are displaced due to violence and persecution than ever before, with over 65 million people driven from their homes. The United States provides the most humanitarian assistance to refugees and maintains the largest refugee resettlement program. However, the President emphasizes the need for everyone to do more to address this crisis. He plans to convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees in September and urges other governments to contribute more funding, provide more resettlement opportunities, and allow refugees to work and attend school. The President also commends Americans who welcome and support refugees, stating that their presence enriches society and reflects American values.
