The White House is announcing several initiatives aimed at improving energy efficiency in buildings and homes. These initiatives include:

- 18 utilities serving over 2.6 million commercial customers will provide access to energy data to building owners by 2017, in an effort to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings.
- 30 cities, states, and organizations commit to making energy data available to building owners, making it easier to identify ways to cut energy waste.
- 24 cities, states, and businesses commit to improving the energy efficiency of their buildings by 20% by 2020.
- 7 cities and states commit to installing more efficient outdoor lighting.

These commitments build on previous commitments made by 285 organizations since the launch of the President's Better Buildings Program in 2011. The program aims to improve energy efficiency by 20% by 2020 and share successful strategies.

The initiatives also complement the Supreme Court's recent decision on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's authority to enable consumers to get paid for cutting energy demand during high price periods. This decision allows for significant annual savings from demand response measures.

The White House is also providing technical assistance to 12 cities and states to streamline and systematize the use of complex building data. Additionally, 21 organizations commit to using DOE's Asset Score tool to identify opportunities to improve energy efficiency in buildings.

Finally, 24 new partners commit to joining the President's Better Buildings Challenge and improving energy efficiency by 20% by 2020. 7 new cities and states also commit to installing more efficient outdoor lighting.

Overall, these initiatives aim to improve energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, and save energy and money in buildings and homes.
