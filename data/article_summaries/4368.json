In this press briefing, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre discusses several topics. Firstly, she announces new actions taken by the Biden-Harris administration to tackle excessive overdraft fees by proposing a rule that would cut the average overdraft fee by more than half. This would save millions of families $150 per year, totaling $3.5 billion in savings for Americans. Jean-Pierre also mentions that retail sales beat expectations last month, signaling a strong economy, and a new poll shows that Americans are optimistic about their finances. She goes on to discuss the United States' response to escalating attacks by the Houthis in the Red Sea, including designating the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Group. Jean-Pierre also mentions that a meeting is taking place with congressional leaders to discuss the situation in Ukraine, emphasizing the urgent need for weapons and capabilities for Ukraine's defense. The briefing concludes with discussions on Turkey's purchase of F-16s and the trial of pro-democracy advocate Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong.
