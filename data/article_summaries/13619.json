The First Lady, Michelle Obama, has announced a new campaign called "Better Make Room" as part of her Reach Higher initiative. The campaign aims to inspire and motivate Generation Z (14-19 year olds) to pursue higher education. Better Make Room will use traditional and social media platforms to highlight student stories and achievements, and provide resources and tools to help students navigate the college application process. The campaign has partnered with various organizations, including Vine, Mashable, AwesomenessTV, and the YMCA, to reach and engage with young people. The Obama administration has also implemented several initiatives to make college more affordable and accessible, such as increasing Pell Grant funding and simplifying the FAFSA application process.
