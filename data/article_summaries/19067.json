The White House has issued a notice to Congress regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism. This national emergency was declared on September 23, 2001, following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The actions of individuals involved in terrorism still pose a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2001 will continue for another year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
