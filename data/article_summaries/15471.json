However, being on this list does not necessarily reflect a country's government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. The article also mentions that certain countries, such as Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela, have failed demonstrably to make substantial efforts to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements. Additionally, the article discusses drug producing and trafficking trends in strategic areas, such as Afghanistan, the Caribbean, Central America, and West Africa. The United States continues to support various programs and initiatives to combat drug production and trafficking in these regions.
