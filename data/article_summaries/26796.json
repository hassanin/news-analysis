President Donald J. Trump is advocating for honesty and transparency in healthcare prices. He believes that patients should have access to information about the cost of services before visiting the doctor. The current healthcare system has kept the true cost of care hidden, which has limited competition and deprived patients of critical information. President Trump aims to protect vulnerable individuals, improve affordability, offer more options, and enhance the quality of American healthcare.
