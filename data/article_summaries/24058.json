President Obama has declared a major disaster in Tennessee and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding hit the state. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in several counties, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to assist with recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities, as well as hazard mitigation measures statewide. W. Montague Winfield has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance through the FEMA website or by calling their toll-free numbers.
