The White House has partnered with Google Art Project to create a virtual 360-degree tour of the White House's public rooms. This initiative is part of President and Mrs. Obama's efforts to make the White House more open and accessible to the public. Since the inauguration, approximately 2.5 million visitors have toured the White House, and now millions more can virtually visit through the Google Art Project. The project allows users to view museum objects in high resolution and explore institutions through Google Street View. The White House is the only building in the world that serves as a home, executive office, and is regularly open to the public for tours. To apply for a White House visit, interested individuals can visit the official website.
