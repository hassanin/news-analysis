President Trump has announced a plan to eliminate the 20-day limit on detaining migrant children crossing the border. This limit, which has been in effect since 2015, has created a dilemma where families cannot be separated, but also cannot be held for more than 20 days, resulting in the release of the entire family. This has created an incentive for adult migrants to bring children along, even if it puts them in danger. The Trump administration argues that this system is unworkable, as evidenced by the nearly 475,000 families that have crossed the border in the last 10 months. Democrats, on the other hand, prefer no detentions and want to allow migrants to enter the country freely. The Trump administration believes their plan provides a humane way to enforce existing laws and bring order to the immigration process.
