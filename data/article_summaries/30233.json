The Presidential Memorandum issued on May 8, 2020, titled "Providing Continued Federal Support for Governorsâ€™ Use of the National Guard to Respond to COVID-19 and to Facilitate Economic Recovery," outlines the policy of the United States to assist state and territorial governors in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The memorandum directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fund 100% of the emergency assistance activities undertaken by the National Guard in South Dakota to prevent, mitigate, and respond to the virus. It also directs the Secretary of Defense to request the Governor of South Dakota to order National Guard forces to fulfill mission assignments issued by FEMA on a fully reimbursable basis. The memorandum extends the 100% federal cost share for the use of National Guard forces through June 24, 2020, and includes duty necessary to comply with health protection protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The memorandum emphasizes that it does not impair any existing authorities or functions of executive departments or agencies, and it does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits against the United States.
