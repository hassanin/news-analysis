The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet on the efforts made by the Obama Administration to combat human trafficking and modern slavery. The President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITF) has brought together various stakeholders to implement strategies to prevent trafficking, protect victims, and prosecute offenders. The fact sheet highlights the progress made in four priority areas: rule of law, victim services, procurement and supply chains, and public awareness and outreach. The United States has been a leader in the global movement to end modern slavery, with initiatives such as the Blue Campaign that provides anti-trafficking training to various organizations. Federal law enforcement agencies have initiated thousands of human trafficking cases and secured numerous convictions. The fact sheet also mentions the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, the Presidential Award for Extraordinary Efforts to Combat Trafficking in Persons, and the Partnership for Freedom competition. It further outlines the efforts made in the areas of rule of law, victim services, procurement and supply chain, and public awareness and outreach.
