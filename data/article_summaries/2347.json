Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at the White House to celebrate Juneteenth, America's newest national holiday. She highlighted the progress made under President Joe Biden's leadership, such as job creation, low Black unemployment, and investments in historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Harris also mentioned the passing of federal gun safety legislation and the appointment of Black judges, including Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on the highest court. She emphasized the importance of Juneteenth as a celebration of Black excellence, culture, and community, and as a reminder of the ongoing fight for freedom, justice, and equality. Harris called for the protection of voting rights, reproductive rights, and the freedom to learn and teach American history in its entirety. She concluded by acknowledging the contributions of Ms. Opal Lee, a prominent advocate for Juneteenth, and urged young people to make a difference and address disparities and challenges facing the country.
