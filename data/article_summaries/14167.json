President Obama will be visiting Allison Transmission's headquarters in Indianapolis to discuss his plan to protect consumers against rising oil prices and decrease oil imports. He will tour the facility and view the assembly process for the 3000 Series transmission, which is the base transmission for the new hybrid propulsion system. This system is being supported by an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Matching Grant. Deputy Transportation Secretary John Porcari and Assistant Secretary of Energy for Policy and International Affairs David Sandalow will also be touring Baltimore's Mondawamin Transit Center to see how hybrid buses and light rail are providing affordable transportation alternatives as gas prices rise. Allison Transmission is a leader in hybrid technology and the world's largest manufacturer of fully-automatic transmissions for commercial vehicles. They employ approximately 2,500 workers in Indiana and have plans to expand their operations, creating up to 205 new jobs by 2013. They have also saved over 17 million gallons of diesel fuel with their hybrid-propulsion systems for buses. Allison is now working on applying their hybrid expertise to the commercial truck markets, with the goal of reducing diesel fuel consumption by 25 to 35 percent. The Administration has also announced fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for cars and light-duty trucks, and plans to finalize similar standards for commercial trucks, vans, and buses. They are also developing the next round of national car rules for Model Years 2017-2025.
