The United States reflects on the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan, honoring the service and sacrifice of military members. Over 2,400 U.S. service members lost their lives, and over 20,000 were wounded. The withdrawal from Afghanistan was conducted with bravery, and a large-scale evacuation effort helped rescue around 120,000 people. The U.S. emphasizes that it can still protect itself from terrorist threats without a permanent troop presence. The nation has welcomed over 117,000 Afghan newcomers and will continue to support the Afghan people with humanitarian assistance. The U.S. plans to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act to provide a pathway to permanent legal status for Afghan allies. The country remains committed to its servicemembers, veterans, and their families, as well as its Afghan partners.
