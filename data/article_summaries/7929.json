President Joe Biden has declared a state of emergency in the U.S. Virgin Islands due to a water shortage and health impact caused by an influx of sargassum seagrass. The declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate relief efforts and provide assistance to save lives and protect property and public health. FEMA will have the authority to identify and provide necessary resources to alleviate the emergency's impacts. The emergency protective measures will be provided for a period of 90 days. Patrick Cornbill has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
