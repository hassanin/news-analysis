According to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is "playing politics with our national security" by attempting to block legislation that would address the shortage of semiconductor chips. Raimondo argues that passing the legislation is crucial for bringing down prices on cars and other products, as well as creating jobs. She also emphasizes the national security implications of not addressing the chips shortage. Raimondo suggests that Congress should pass both the CHIPS Act and a bill allowing Medicare to negotiate for drug prices, as both measures are important for lowering prices and benefiting the American people.
