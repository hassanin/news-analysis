The article discusses the Climate Action Champions competition launched by the White House to recognize and support local communities that are taking action to combat climate change. The competition aims to provide targeted federal support to help these communities further raise their ambitions in cutting carbon pollution and building resilience to climate impacts. The first cohort of 16 Climate Action Champions have been announced, representing diverse communities from across the country. These communities will benefit from peer-to-peer learning and mentorship, as well as targeted support from federal programs. The article also mentions new resilience funding opportunities available to local communities, including funding for smart grid technologies and resilient coastal communities.
