President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Kansas and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts following a snowstorm that occurred in February 2013. The federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain non-profit organizations, for emergency protective measures and the repair or replacement of damaged buildings and equipment. The assistance will be provided on a cost-sharing basis. In addition, federal funding will be available for snow assistance and hazard mitigation measures in specific counties. Joe M. Girot has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Further designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by damage assessments.
