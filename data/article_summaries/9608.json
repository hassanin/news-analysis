The Obama Administration has released new open data rules to make government information more accessible to the public and entrepreneurs. The Executive Order and Open Data Policy require government data to be available in open, machine-readable formats, while still protecting privacy and security. This move aims to stimulate entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic growth by allowing entrepreneurs and researchers to use government data to create new products and services. The Administration also announced the launch of new services on Data.gov, the release of open source tools on Github, and continued engagement with entrepreneurs and innovators to leverage government data.
