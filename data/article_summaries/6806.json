This article discusses an executive order issued by President Joe Biden to expand the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). The order amends a previous executive order to increase the number of members on the PCAST to not more than 32. The order clarifies that it does not affect the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also states that the order must be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. Furthermore, the order does not create any rights or benefits that can be legally enforced against the United States or any other party.
