President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to Libya, which was declared in Executive Order 13566 in 2011 and expanded in Executive Order 13726 in 2016, is to continue beyond February 25, 2022. The ongoing instability in Libya, resulting from actions taken by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his associates in 2011, has led to civil conflict. The resolution of political divisions and the end of foreign military intervention are necessary for the conflict to cease. There is a risk of misappropriation of Libyan state assets by parties seeking to undermine the United Nations peace process, including former members of the Qadhafi government and his close associates. This misappropriation could further deepen instability in Libya, benefiting terrorist groups like ISIS. The continuation of sanctions is crucial to prevent military escalation and protect against the abuse of Libyan assets by those hindering national reconciliation. President Biden has determined that the national emergency in Libya must continue to address these threats to US national security and foreign policy.
