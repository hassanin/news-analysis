On June 26, 2008, President Trump declared a national emergency with respect to North Korea due to the threat of weapons-usable fissile material proliferation on the Korean Peninsula. The President also maintained certain restrictions on North Korea that would have otherwise been lifted. In subsequent years, the scope of the national emergency was expanded to address North Korea's actions, including the sinking of a South Korean navy ship, nuclear tests, missile launches, violation of UN Security Council Resolutions, and illicit activities in international markets. The national emergency has been extended multiple times, most recently on June 22, 2018, for another year.
