One year ago, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, which is the largest investment in clean energy and climate action ever. The law aims to help the United States meet its climate goals, create jobs, reduce energy and healthcare costs, and make the tax code fairer. In the past year, the law has already had a significant impact, creating over 170,000 clean energy jobs and attracting over $110 billion in clean energy manufacturing investments. The law is also delivering funds to protect communities from climate change and capping the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 per month. To mark the anniversary of the law, the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing a feature on Invest.gov that highlights stories of how the law is making a difference for Americans in all 50 states and U.S. territories. The law is also helping the United States make significant progress in combating the climate crisis, with estimates showing that it will cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 41% below 2005 levels by 2030. Additionally, the law is driving domestic manufacturing, creating union jobs, and lowering energy costs for Americans. It is estimated that the law will lower electricity rates by up to 9% and gas prices by up to 13% by 2030. The law is also making healthcare more affordable, with nearly 15 million people saving an average of $800 per year on their insurance premiums. Furthermore, the law ensures that wealthy individuals and big corporations pay their fair share of taxes, raising $300 billion over a decade. The law also invests in modernizing the IRS, enabling the collection of at least $150 billion in taxes owed by the wealthy and big corporations over the next decade.
