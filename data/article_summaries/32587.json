This article discusses a Presidential Memoranda issued on March 27, 2018, by President Donald Trump. The memorandum states that a national emergency was declared on April 1, 2015, due to the increasing prevalence of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from outside the United States. The President issued an Executive Order in December 2016 to address this national emergency. The memorandum states that these cyber threats continue to pose a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2015 will remain in effect beyond April 1, 2018, for an additional year. The memorandum will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
