In this op-ed, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden highlight the untapped potential of veterans in the technology industry. They point out that the U.S. military has produced many talented technology professionals who have pioneered innovations such as the Internet and GPS. With over 150,000 men and women in the military working in tech jobs, the authors argue that these individuals have the skills and experience to handle the demands of the technology sector. They provide examples of veterans like Donny Greene, a former Air Force cyber analyst, who have successfully transitioned to civilian jobs in the tech industry. The authors also emphasize the value of military spouses who possess similar skills and experience. They state that hiring veterans and military spouses is not only the patriotic thing to do but also a smart business decision. They highlight the commitment of over 50 American companies and organizations, including Amazon, J.P. Morgan Chase, and AT&T, to hire and train veterans and military spouses. The authors conclude by urging future leaders to make veteran and military-spouse employment a national priority, as there are still many veterans returning to civilian life each year who need employment opportunities.
