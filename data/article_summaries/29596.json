President Trump signed an executive order to create an Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection at the Department of Veterans Affairs. This office will hold accountable those who fail veterans and protect those who expose wrongdoing. The President also called on the Senate to pass legislation that would give the Secretary the authority to hold all VA employees accountable for how they treat veterans. This executive order is seen as a bold step forward in reforming and improving the VA and ensuring that veterans receive the healthcare they need and deserve. The President expressed his commitment to making life great for veterans and thanked Secretary Shulkin for his work in reforming the VA.
