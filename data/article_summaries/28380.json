President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed April 15 through April 23, 2017, as National Park Week in the United States. During this week, entrance fees to national parks across the country will be waived, allowing all visitors to experience the history and beauty of these treasures. The national park system began with the establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, inspired by Thomas Moran's painting, "The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone." President Theodore Roosevelt, known for his conservation efforts, expanded the national park system during his presidency. Today, visitors from around the world come to the 59 national parks in the US to enjoy activities such as hiking and exploring nature. President Trump emphasizes the importance of protecting these lands and ensuring access for all Americans. He has donated the first portion of his salary as President to the American Battlefield Protection Program, which preserves significant battlefields. The proclamation encourages Americans to visit national parks and learn about their natural, cultural, and historical heritage.
