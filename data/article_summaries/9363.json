He called it a great milestone and attributed it to the success of the vaccination campaign in the country. Biden stated that cases are down in 49 of the 50 states, hospitalizations are at their lowest since April 2020, and deaths are down 80 percent. He praised the American people for their resilience and for getting vaccinated. Biden emphasized that those who are not vaccinated should continue wearing masks for their own protection and the protection of others. He urged everyone to get vaccinated and assured that it is easier than ever, with 80,000 locations across the country. The President also mentioned ongoing negotiations with Republicans on infrastructure funding and expressed optimism about reaching a reasonable agreement. He concluded by saying that better days are ahead for America.
