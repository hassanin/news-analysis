President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order affirming the United States' policy to counter Iran's influence in the Middle East. The order focuses on preventing Iran from transferring destabilizing conventional weapons and acquiring arms and related materials. Transfers of arms to and from Iran pose a threat to regional and international security, as Iran uses the arms trade to strengthen relationships with other outlier regimes, decrease international isolation, and fund terror groups and malign activities. The order blocks the property and interests in property of individuals determined by the Secretary of State or the Secretary of the Treasury to be involved in these activities. Additionally, under section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the order suspends the entry into the United States of aliens who meet the criteria for property blocking.
