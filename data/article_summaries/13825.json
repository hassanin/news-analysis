The article is a Presidential Determination by Barack Obama, issued on November 14, 2016. The determination is made pursuant to Section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. It states that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran, which allows for a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran. However, the United States will continue to fulfill its commitments specified in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and will no longer pursue efforts to reduce Iran's sales of crude oil. The determination was effective upon reaching Implementation Day under the JCPOA, which occurred once the International Atomic Energy Agency verified that Iran had implemented key nuclear-related steps to ensure the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
