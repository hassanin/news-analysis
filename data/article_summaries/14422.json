The White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, released a statement on the progress of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) for American workers and pending free trade agreements. The statement emphasized President Obama's commitment to a trade agenda that increases exports, supports American workers, and upholds American values. The negotiations have resulted in an agreement on the terms for a renewed and strengthened TAA, which aims to help workers who lose their jobs due to increased imports or outsourcing. The President supports the critical elements of TAA that will provide workers with better job opportunities. The statement also calls for moving forward with the Korea, Colombia, and Panama trade agreements, which are expected to create tens of thousands of jobs. Fact sheets on the proposed improvements to TAA and the Colombia, Panama, and South Korea Free Trade Agreements are provided in the article.
