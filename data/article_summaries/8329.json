President Biden announced a major breakthrough in the United States' partnership with the European Union (EU) to address climate change while protecting American jobs and industry. The deal immediately removes tariffs on EU products, lowers costs for American consumers, and ensures a strong and competitive US steel industry. The partnership aims to negotiate a carbon-based arrangement on steel and aluminum trade to incentivize emission reductions and restrict access to markets for dirty steel. The agreement is a testament to the power of American diplomacy and strong partnerships and demonstrates that economic growth, job creation, and tackling the climate crisis can go hand in hand. The EU will also suspend tariffs on US steel and aluminum, and both parties will pause the dispute at the World Trade Organization. This deal marks a milestone in the renewed EU-US partnership and a significant step forward in fighting climate change and achieving sustainability in global steel production and trade.
