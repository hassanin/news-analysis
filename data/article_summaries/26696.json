President Donald J. Trump has issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency in response to the International Criminal Court's attempts to assert authority over United States personnel and personnel of U.S. allies without their consent. The order blocks the property and interests in property of foreign persons determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General. Additionally, the order suspends the unrestricted entry into the United States of aliens, their immediate family members, and persons employed by or acting as agents of the ICC.
