President Joe Biden has declared the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument, encompassing approximately 917,618 acres of federal lands and interests in lands. The monument is established to protect the unique historic, cultural, and scientific objects found in the region, as well as the landscapes themselves. The proclamation acknowledges the deep spiritual and cultural significance of the area to Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples, who have long used the lands for traditional practices and continue to rely on them for cultural sustenance. The management of the monument will be carried out by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service, with the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture jointly preparing a management plan. The plan will incorporate input from Tribal Nations, local governments, and other stakeholders, and will prioritize the preservation of natural resources, traditional uses, and ecological restoration. The proclamation also emphasizes the protection of sacred sites and cultural properties, access for traditional practices, and the involvement of Tribal Nations in the stewardship of the monument.
