House Republicans' proposed continuing resolution (CR) includes indiscriminate cuts to programs that many Americans rely on, going against the agreement made between the Speaker and President Biden and rejecting the bipartisan approach taken by the Senate. These cuts are intended to push for longer-term cuts in line with the Republicans' appropriations bills. If these proposed 8% cuts were extended for the entire year, it would have significant impacts on the American people. The article does not provide specific details about the impacts, but it suggests that the cuts would have negative consequences for the American public and their access to essential services.
