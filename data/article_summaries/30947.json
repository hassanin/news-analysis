On December 21, 2018, President Donald Trump signed into law the "Sanctioning the Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act". The Act includes a provision that requires the President to impose mandatory sanctions on certain foreign nationals, such as asset blocking and entry restrictions into the United States. However, the President's Administration will apply these provisions in accordance with their constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations. This includes the President's authority to receive ambassadors and other public ministers. Additionally, the provisions of the Act will be applied consistently with the discretion given to the Secretary of Homeland Security to parole into the United States a foreign national whose presence is sought for law enforcement purposes, as provided by the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Homeland Security Act of 2002.
