Officials from twelve federal agencies and the White House met with Mayor-Elect Mitch Landrieu and his transition team in New Orleans to discuss policy priorities for the city and the Obama Administration. Topics discussed included jobs, housing, education, healthcare, ecosystem restoration, and criminal justice. The Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative, aimed at improving access to affordable housing, transportation options, and lowering transportation costs while protecting the environment, was also highlighted. The meetings demonstrated the President's commitment to the region and his ongoing efforts to support Gulf Coast residents in their recovery and rebuilding efforts. Since taking office, the Obama Administration has worked to provide residents with the tools they need to recover and has improved coordination among Federal agencies and with State and local partners.
