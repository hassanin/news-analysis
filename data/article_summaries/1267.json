The U.S.-EU Task Force on European Energy Security recently held a virtual meeting to discuss progress made since the March 25 Joint Statement by Presidents Biden and Von der Leyen. The focus of the meeting was on denouncing Russia's energy coercion of EU member states and reaffirming the commitment to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels. The task force aims to achieve this by diversifying Europe's energy supply, reducing energy demand through efficiency measures, deploying smart technology, and increasing the use of renewable energy.
