The CDC's eviction moratorium, which has been in place for almost 11 months, has prevented renters affected by the COVID-19 pandemic from being evicted for not paying rent. It has protected many Americans from homelessness and health risks during the pandemic. The CDC extended the moratorium until July 31st, but the Supreme Court ruled that further extensions would require new legislation from Congress. President Biden is calling on Congress to extend the moratorium to protect vulnerable renters. He has also asked several departments to extend their eviction moratoria for federally-insured properties. Additionally, he urges states and localities to distribute Emergency Rental Assistance funds promptly to help those in need. The administration is committed to keeping people safely housed.
