First Lady Michelle Obama delivered a speech at the 100,000 Jobs Mission Coalition "Virtual Convening" in 2015. She thanked Tony, who works on behalf of the 100,000 Jobs Mission, and praised the talent and commitment of the newest generation of veterans. She highlighted the skills and experiences that veterans and military spouses bring to the workforce, including resilience, drive, nimbleness, and creativity. Mrs. Obama acknowledged that although the unemployment rate has dropped for post-9/11 veterans, it still lags behind the general population, especially for the youngest veterans. She praised the Joining Forces initiative, which she and Dr. Jill Biden started to support veterans and military families, and commended the 100,000 Jobs Mission Coalition for their efforts in hiring veterans and military spouses. The coalition grew from 11 companies to over 185 and had hired more than 217,000 veterans and military spouses. Mrs. Obama thanked JPMorgan Chase for their leadership and recognized the HR and hiring managers on the call for their commitment to hiring veterans. She emphasized the need to continue the effort in helping veterans transition back to civilian life and encouraged companies to make a long-term commitment to hiring veterans and military spouses. She also urged the coalition to reach out to other businesses, share best practices, and expand the coalition. Mrs. Obama assured the coalition that the administration, including the VA, the Departments of Defense and Labor, and Joining Forces, are working to support their efforts in hiring veterans. She mentioned the VA's online Veterans Employment Center and encouraged companies to register and provide feedback to improve the platform. Mrs. Obama concluded by expressing her gratitude and looking forward to working with the coalition in the future.
