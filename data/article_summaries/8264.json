President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism, declared in Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001, is to continue beyond September 23, 2022. The President cites the ongoing threat of terrorism and the unresolved crisis posed by foreign terrorists, including the attacks on September 11, 2001, as the reasons for continuing the national emergency. The President believes that this crisis continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
