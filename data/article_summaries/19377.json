Last night, suspicious packages were discovered on two planes heading to the United States. The packages originated from Yemen and were found in the United Kingdom and Dubai. Security measures were implemented at Newark Liberty and Philadelphia International Airports as a result of this threat. President Obama was notified of the potential terrorist threat and directed intelligence and law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety of the American people and investigate any additional terrorist plotting. The President has been receiving regular updates from his national security team since being alerted to the threat.
