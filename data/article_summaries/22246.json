First Lady Michelle Obama celebrated the success of the Million PALA Challenge at Nickelodeon's Worldwide Day of Play. The challenge, a joint initiative of Let's Move! and the President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition (PCFSN), aimed to motivate one million Americans to get active and earn the Presidential Active Lifestyle Award (PALA) in a year. Since its launch in September 2010, over 1.7 million Americans have achieved their PALA, surpassing the initiative's goal. Mrs. Obama "turned off" Nickelodeon for three hours during the event to encourage kids to go outside and play. She made a surprise visit, cheering kids on at the obstacle course and congratulating the achievers. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius commended the achievers and emphasized that the initiative is not finished yet. PALA is a PCFSN program that rewards youth and adults who are active for a certain amount of time each day. Mrs. Obama also announced the launch of PALA+, an improved version that incorporates elements of MyPlate and encourages healthy eating habits. Participants can learn more about PALA+ and sign up at www.presidentschallenge.org. The program offers a free certificate and participants can order a certificate signed by the President. Various organizations, including General Mills Foundation, Miami-Dade County Public Schools, NBA/WNBA Fit, NFL PLAY 60 Challenge & Fuel Up to Play 60, Nickelodeon, PGA and The First Tee, Sharecare.com, and USTA, helped promote the Million PALA Challenge and received recognition for their efforts.
