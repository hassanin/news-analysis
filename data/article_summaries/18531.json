The White House held a conference call to discuss President Obama's upcoming speech regarding the fight against ISIL. The officials on the call provided background information on the context of the speech and outlined the key elements of the strategy. They emphasized the importance of forming an inclusive Iraqi government and building a coalition of regional and international partners to combat ISIL. The strategy includes a systematic campaign of airstrikes against ISIL targets in Iraq and Syria, increased support for Iraqi and Kurdish forces on the ground, efforts to disrupt ISIL's funding and flow of foreign fighters, and humanitarian assistance for displaced civilians. The officials stated that the goal is to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, but acknowledged that it will be a long-term and sustained effort. They also discussed the need for congressional support and authorization for certain actions, such as training and equipping the Syrian opposition. Overall, the officials portrayed the strategy as consistent with previous counterterrorism efforts in Yemen and Somalia.
