On November 27, 2018, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the situation in Nicaragua. This was done to address the threat posed to national security and foreign policy by the violent response of the Nicaraguan government to protests, as well as its dismantling of democratic institutions, use of violence against civilians, and corruption leading to economic destabilization. On October 24, 2022, President Biden issued Executive Order 14088 to take further action in relation to this national emergency. Due to the ongoing threat to national security and foreign policy, the national emergency declared in 2018 will continue beyond November 27, 2022. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and has been transmitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
