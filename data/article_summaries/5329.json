The Gordie Howe International Bridge is a significant infrastructure project between Canada and the United States. It aims to create a seamless highway-to-highway connection between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan. This new crossing will enhance trade and economic growth in the region. Canada is financing the project, and various partners, including the State of Michigan and the Federal Highway Administration, are involved. The project is scheduled for completion by the end of 2024, and both governments are committed to supporting it to ensure its success.
