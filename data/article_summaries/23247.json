In this statement, the President expresses disappointment over Senate Republicans blocking the Buffett Rule, which aims to ensure that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes. The President argues that at a time when there are deficits to close and investments to make, it is not affordable to continue spending money on tax cuts for the wealthy. The President emphasizes the importance of basic fairness, stating that it is wrong for middle-class Americans to pay a higher share of their income in taxes compared to some millionaires and billionaires. The President believes that America prospers when everyone has equal opportunities for success and when everyone contributes their fair share. The President also highlights the need to build an economy where everyone has a fair shot, does their fair share, and plays by the same rules. The President concludes by stating that he will continue to urge Congress to take steps to restore economic security for the middle class and create a sustainable economy.
