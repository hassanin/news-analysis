General Raymond Odierno, a retired US Army officer, has passed away, leaving a devastating impact on the military community. Odierno was known for his dedication to his fellow service members and played a vital role in shaping the modern United States Army. He was highly respected by allies and feared by adversaries. Odierno was involved in significant events during the time of Vice President Joe Biden and Second Lady Jill Biden, including welcoming them to Camp Victory in Iraq and providing wisdom to West Point graduates. He and his wife were strong advocates for military families. Odierno's support during the funeral of their late son Beau was deeply appreciated by the Bidens. His passing is a great loss for the nation, and condolences go out to his wife, children, and grandchildren.
