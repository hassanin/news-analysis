The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, signed into law by the Obama-Biden Administration, provides protections against pay discrimination and has helped close gender and racial wage gaps. However, there is still work to be done, as women are paid, on average, 84 cents for every dollar paid to men, and the gap is even greater for women of color. The current administration is committed to strengthening equal pay protections, including advancing pay equity for the Federal workforce and promoting efforts to achieve pay equity for job applicants and employees of Federal contractors. The Paycheck Fairness Act, which would increase pay transparency and fight sex-based pay discrimination, is also being advocated for. The aim is to ensure that all workers are paid fairly, which not only promotes economic security for women and their families but also strengthens the economy as a whole.
