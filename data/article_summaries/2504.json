The United States, along with its allies and partners, has implemented extensive sanctions and export control actions against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. These measures aim to undermine Russia's ability to wage war and hold them accountable for their aggressive actions. President Biden will sign an Executive Order to further tighten the pressure on Russia's military capabilities and those who support them. The existing sanctions have already weakened Russia's ability to replace equipment and resources, forcing them to rely on rogue regimes for supplies. The new sanctions will target foreign financial institutions that facilitate significant transactions related to Russia's military industry, warning them of the risk of being sanctioned. The message is clear: anyone supporting Russia's unlawful war effort may lose access to the U.S. financial system.
