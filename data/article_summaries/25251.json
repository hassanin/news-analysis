President Donald J. Trump has granted a Presidential pardon to Joe Arpaio, the former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona. Arpaio's career in public service began when he enlisted in the military at 18 during the Korean War. After serving in the Army, he became a police officer in Washington, D.C. and Las Vegas, NV, and later worked as a Special Agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). In 1992, Arpaio returned to law enforcement and was elected Sheriff of Maricopa County. Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio focused on combating crime and illegal immigration. At 85 years old, after more than 50 years of service, Arpaio has been deemed a worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon.
