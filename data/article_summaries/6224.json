The Department of Justice will file a brief in the Supreme Court in the case United States v. Vaello-Madero, which questions whether a provision in the Social Security Act that denies Puerto Rico residents Supplemental Security Income (SSI) violates equal protection. While this provision contradicts the administration's policies and values, the Department of Justice has a tradition of defending the constitutionality of federal statutes, regardless of policy preferences. The Department is defending the provision in this case to uphold the rule of law. The President believes that Puerto Rico residents should be eligible for SSI benefits and urges Congress to amend the Social Security Act accordingly. Additionally, the President supports eliminating Medicaid funding caps for Puerto Rico and achieving parity in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. These steps, along with the American Rescue Plan, aim to provide equal opportunities for families in Puerto Rico. The President pledges to collaborate with Congress to enact these changes.
