The White House has issued a notice to continue the national emergency with respect to Libya. The national emergency was initially declared in 2011 in response to the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his government, including the use of weapons of war and violence against civilians. The declaration was made to protect against the misappropriation of Libyan state assets by Qadhafi and his associates. The situation in Libya is still considered a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and the national emergency will continue for another year.
