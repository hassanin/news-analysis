Leaders from Belgium, France, the United States, and the Republic of Korea have come together during the Second Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul to address the issue of highly-enriched uranium (HEU) in civilian use. They recognize that minimizing HEU is essential for nuclear security and have committed to converting research reactors from HEU fuel to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel. The United States will provide 100 kg of LEU by the end of 2012 to the Republic of Korea, who will use it to manufacture U-Mo powder. This powder will then be provided to France for the production of high-density U-Mo fuel. France and Belgium will load this fuel into their research reactors once it has been qualified. Experts will assess the performance and technical aspects of the fuel, with the intention of sharing information and providing assistance to other countries looking to convert reactors from HEU to LEU fuel. The leaders express confidence that this project contributes to the goal of minimizing HEU in civilian use and emphasize the importance of international cooperation and support for the universal use of LEU-based U-Mo fuel.
