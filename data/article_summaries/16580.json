On May 25, 2012, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 4045, allows for a modification to the award of administrative absence days for certain members of the reserve components who have completed post-deployment or mobilization. The second bill, H.R. 4967, is called the "Temporary Bankruptcy Judgeships Extension Act of 2012," and it extends the authority to fill vacancies in temporary offices of bankruptcy judges in specific Federal judicial districts.
