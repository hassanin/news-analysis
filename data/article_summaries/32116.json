President Donald Trump has signed the "Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019" into law. However, he has expressed concerns about certain provisions within the bill. Specifically, two provisions require that Congress receive notification or certification before the President can direct certain military actions. The President reiterates that these types of provisions should only apply to actions that can reasonably provide advance notification or certification and are consistent with his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief.

Additionally, the President takes issue with several provisions of the bill that condition the Executive's authority to spend or reallocate funds on the approval of congressional committees. He argues that these provisions represent an inappropriate expansion of congressional power in the execution of laws. While the President's administration will notify the relevant committees before taking specified actions and will consider their recommendations seriously, he maintains that spending decisions should not be dependent on the approval of congressional committees.
