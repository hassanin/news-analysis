In this statement, President Obama discusses two issues: the humanitarian crisis in Sri Lanka and the detainee photographs. He expresses concern for the tens of thousands of innocent civilians trapped between government forces and the Tamil Tigers, calling on the Tigers to lay down their arms and let civilians go. He also urges the Sri Lankan government to stop indiscriminate shelling, allow UN humanitarian teams access to trapped civilians, and grant access to displaced people for additional support. 

Regarding the detainee photographs, President Obama argues against their release. He states that while the photos are not particularly sensational, they represent conduct that did not conform with the Army Manual and appropriate actions have been taken. He believes that releasing the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment and put troops in greater danger. He also fears it would have a chilling effect on future investigations of detainee abuse. The President emphasizes that the abuse of detainees is prohibited and will not be tolerated.
