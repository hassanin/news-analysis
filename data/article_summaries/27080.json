President Donald J. Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692, regarding the situation in Venezuela, will continue beyond March 8, 2018. The President cites the erosion of human rights guarantees, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, violence and human rights violations in response to protests, arbitrary arrest and detention of protestors, and significant government corruption as reasons for the national emergency to continue.
