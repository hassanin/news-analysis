The White House has issued a Presidential Memorandum on building national capabilities for long-term drought resilience. The memorandum emphasizes the need for sustained efforts to reduce vulnerability to drought impacts, which include threats to agricultural production, drinking water supplies, critical infrastructure, and economic and health impacts. The memorandum establishes the National Drought Resilience Partnership (NDRP) to coordinate federal support for drought-related efforts and promote collaboration across all levels of government and the private sector. The memorandum also outlines specific goals and actions to be taken by federal agencies, such as data collection and integration, communicating drought risks to critical infrastructure, drought planning and capacity building, coordination of federal drought activity, market-based approaches for infrastructure and efficiency, and innovative water use, efficiency, and technology. The NDRP will be administered by the Department of Agriculture, and a Long-Term Drought Resilience Action Plan will be developed and updated as necessary. Regional coordination and implementation will be established to provide federal assistance to states, regions, tribes, and localities facing drought challenges. The memorandum also provides definitions of key terms and includes general provisions for implementation.
