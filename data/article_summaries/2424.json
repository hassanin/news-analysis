The United States has been elected to serve on the UN Human Rights Council for a three-year term. The US president expresses gratitude for the support from nations around the world and hopes that the US can be a constructive voice in pushing the council to fulfill its mandate and protect human rights. The president emphasizes the importance of the choices made in shaping the future world, and states that the US is ready to work with partners and allies to lead towards a peaceful and prosperous future based on respect for human dignity. The US aims to stand up for the rights of all, including marginalized groups, and promote accountability for governments that abuse human rights. The administration's foreign policy prioritizes defending human rights and demonstrating the effectiveness of democracies. In December, the president will host a virtual Summit for Democracy to emphasize the power of democratic governance in addressing current challenges and unleashing human potential.
