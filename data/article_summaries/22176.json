President Obama has signed into law the "Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing Enforcement Act" (H.R. 774), which aims to prevent illegally harvested fish from entering the US ports and market. The legislation is a bipartisan effort to combat illegal fishing practices and achieve sustainable fisheries globally. The US will now join a global effort to ratify and implement the Port State Measures Agreement, which prevents vessels carrying illegally caught fish from entering ports and keeps illegal products out of the market. The US is working with other countries to finalize the treaty, which requires 25 countries to enter into force. These measures will protect US fishermen from unfair competition, ensure consumer confidence in the seafood supply, and strengthen domestic enforcement authorities to prevent illegally harvested or falsely labeled fish from being sold in the US. The administration is also seeking additional enforcement authorities from Congress to level the playing field for the US fishing industry.
