The Obama Administration has announced a comprehensive strategy for energy security, which includes expanding domestic oil and gas production while protecting the environment, implementing landmark fuel standards for cars and trucks, greening the federal vehicle fleet, and emphasizing energy security in the Department of Defense. The strategy aims to reduce dependence on foreign oil, create jobs, and promote clean energy. The plan includes developing oil and gas resources in new areas, increasing exploration in frontier areas, and protecting special ocean areas from drilling. It also finalizes greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy standards for light-duty vehicles, which is expected to save 1.8 billion barrels of oil. The federal government is leading by example by greening its vehicle fleet and encouraging the use of advanced biofuels in the Department of Defense.
