The United States and Japan have issued a joint statement confirming that if Japan joins the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, all goods would be subject to negotiation, and Japan would work towards achieving a comprehensive, high-standard agreement. Both countries acknowledge that they have specific trade sensitivities, such as certain agricultural products for Japan and certain manufactured products for the United States. The statement emphasizes that no prior commitment is required to unilaterally eliminate all tariffs upon joining the TPP negotiations, as the final outcome will be determined during the negotiations. The two governments will continue bilateral consultations regarding Japan's potential interest in joining the TPP, with a focus on addressing concerns related to the automotive and insurance sectors, non-tariff measures, and meeting the high standards of the TPP.
