The White House has announced a series of actions aimed at bringing jobs and clean energy to rural America. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is investing nearly $7 million in funding through its Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) to support renewable energy and energy efficiency projects across the country. Since President Obama took office, USDA has awarded $545 million through REAP for over 8,800 projects, helping to install renewable energy systems and make energy efficiency upgrades. The White House is also hosting a roundtable discussion with businesses and organizations that are taking action to cut emissions and strengthen the rural economy, including companies like Cargill, Coca-Cola, and Walmart. Several businesses and organizations have also made commitments to improve agricultural practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve water quality, and increase water efficiency. These commitments include sourcing raw commodities sustainably, harmonizing metrics to assess sustainability, and expanding sustainable farming initiatives. The actions announced build on the Administration's efforts to reduce carbon pollution, scale up financing for renewable energy and energy efficiency, and create jobs in rural America. These efforts include the release of a framework to support farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners in responding to climate change, the expansion of the Conservation Reserve Program to protect environmentally sensitive land, and the investment of up to $100 million in a Biofuels Infrastructure Partnership. Additionally, USDA has established regional Climate Hubs to address increasing risks and translate relevant science and research to land managers. The agency has also worked with farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners to implement conservation practices that have reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
