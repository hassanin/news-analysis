Secretary Austin's announcement to accept the core recommendations of the Independent Review Commission on Military Sexual Assault (IRC) is strongly supported. This includes removing the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault from the chain of command and creating specialized units to handle these cases. The article emphasizes the importance of ending violence against women and eliminating sexual assault in the military, as it is an abuse of power and damages the unity and cohesion of the U.S. military. Concrete actions are needed to fundamentally change how military sexual assault is handled and ensure that these crimes are prosecuted to the fullest extent. Effective prevention strategies, promoting safe and respectful climates, and improving services for victims are also priorities. The article expresses gratitude towards Lynn Rosenthal, the IRC, and members of Congress for their leadership and dedication to this issue. The experiences of survivors and their right to justice are acknowledged, and the announcement is seen as the beginning of significant reforms in the military.
