In this article, President Barack Obama issues a determination regarding the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008. He determines that it is in the national interest of the United States to waive the prohibition in section 404(a) of the act with respect to Chad, South Sudan, and Yemen. He also waives in part the application of the prohibition with respect to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia, allowing for certain provisions such as International Military Education and Training (IMET), nonlethal defense articles, and licenses for direct commercial sales. The determination is to be submitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
