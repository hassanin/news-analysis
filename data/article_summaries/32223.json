On June 16, 2006, President George W. Bush declared a national emergency in response to actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other individuals that posed a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. These actions included undermining Belarus's democratic processes, committing human rights abuses, and engaging in public corruption. The national emergency, declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, was set to expire on June 16, 2018. However, President Donald Trump has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, stating that the threat posed by certain members of the Belarusian government and others continues to be unusual and extraordinary. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
