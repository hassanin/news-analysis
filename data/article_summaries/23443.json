On March 24, 2009, President Obama signed a major disaster declaration for North Dakota due to severe storms and flooding that began on March 13, 2009. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding is available for emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance, in various counties and reservations in North Dakota. Michael J. Hall has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys will be conducted once the situation permits. For further information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-4600.
