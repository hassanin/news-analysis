President Barack Obama will award 24 Army veterans the Medal of Honor for their valor during major combat operations in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. These veterans had previously been recognized with the Distinguished Service Cross, but their awards will be upgraded to the Medal of Honor in recognition of their gallantry, intrepidity, and heroism. The recipients include soldiers from various backgrounds, including Jewish and Hispanic Americans. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who demonstrate gallantry above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in military operations against an enemy of the United States or in conflict with opposing forces.
