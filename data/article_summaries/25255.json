President Donald Trump has signed the "Johnson-O'Malley Supplemental Indian Education Program Modernization Act" into law. The act amends the Johnson-O'Malley Act of 1934 and includes a provision that requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit an annual report recommending appropriate funding levels for the program. However, President Trump states that he will treat this provision in a manner consistent with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, which allows the President to recommend measures that they deem necessary and expedient to Congress.
