The article is a Presidential Memoranda on Foreign Policy issued by President Donald J. Trump on October 4, 2018. The memorandum concerns the determination on refugee admissions for Fiscal Year 2019. The President authorizes the admission of up to 30,000 refugees to the United States, based on humanitarian concerns or national interest. The admissions will be allocated among regions, with Africa receiving 11,000, East Asia receiving 4,000, Europe and Central Asia receiving 3,000, Latin America/Caribbean receiving 3,000, and Near East/South Asia receiving 9,000. The memorandum also allows for the transfer of unused admissions from one region to another if needed. The President determines that providing assistance to refugees will contribute to the foreign policy interests of the United States. Certain persons in specific countries are specified as eligible for refugee status within their countries of nationality or habitual residence. The memorandum directs the publication of this determination in the Federal Register.
