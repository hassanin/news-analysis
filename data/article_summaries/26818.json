On September 24, 2017, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation that imposed conditional restrictions and limitations on the entry of nationals from certain countries into the United States. The proclamation was based on a worldwide review conducted by the Secretary of Homeland Security, which assessed whether additional information would be needed from each foreign country to assess whether their nationals pose a security or safety threat. The review found that a small number of countries remain deficient in their identity-management and information-sharing capabilities. As a result, the President determined that restrictions and limitations on entry into the United States for nationals from these countries are necessary to protect the security and interests of the United States. The countries affected by the restrictions include Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen. Somalia was also included, but with certain exceptions. The proclamation provides for case-by-case waivers and establishes a process for assessing whether the restrictions and limitations should be continued, modified, terminated, or supplemented in the future.
