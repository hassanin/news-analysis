Senators Kerry, Lieberman, and Graham have released a legislative framework for comprehensive energy reform, which the Obama Administration sees as a positive step towards a strong and bipartisan agreement in the U.S. Senate. The Obama Administration has been working towards building a clean energy economy, creating jobs, and reducing dependence on foreign oil. The passage of comprehensive energy legislation is seen as essential to these efforts. The President has received support from CEOs who believe that clean energy legislation and international agreements on emissions reduction will strengthen the economy and enhance competitiveness. The President is looking forward to working with the Senate and signing comprehensive energy and climate legislation as soon as possible.
