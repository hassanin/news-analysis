During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki introduced Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen to discuss the state of the labor market. Yellen highlighted the progress made in job growth, with an average of over half a million jobs added in the past three months. She also mentioned the need to address barriers to higher labor market participation, particularly for women and men who have left the workforce. Yellen expressed confidence in the economy's recovery but emphasized the importance of long-term investments in American families and workers. During the briefing, Psaki also addressed questions about the impact of unemployment benefits on hiring, the need for continued economic relief, and the administration's response to the situation in Russia and the Middle East.
