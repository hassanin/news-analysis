President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring September 19, 2014, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. The proclamation acknowledges the sacrifices made by service members who have not returned home and their families, emphasizing that they are not forgotten. The administration is dedicated to accounting for missing heroes and ensuring that they are buried with honor and dignity. The proclamation also highlights the commitment to securing the release of citizens who are unjustly detained abroad. The stark black and white banner symbolizing America's Missing in Action and Prisoners of War will be flown at various locations across the country as a reminder of the obligation to remember and honor these sacrifices. The proclamation urges all Americans to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
