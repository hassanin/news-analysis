President Biden will sign an Executive Order on Reforming Federal Funding and Support for Tribal Nations during the White House Tribal Nations Summit. This order aims to respect Tribal sovereignty and promote Tribal self-determination by giving Tribal Nations greater autonomy over how they invest federal funding. The order acknowledges that past federal policies have harmed Tribal communities and governments, but since the 1970s, there has been a shift towards supporting Tribal self-determination. However, many barriers still exist, such as difficult access to federal funding programs and burdensome reporting requirements. The Executive Order seeks to address these challenges and defines the next era of federal policies as one that respects Tribal sovereignty and autonomy. It affirms the right of Tribal Nations to determine their own destiny and emphasizes the importance of Tribal governments in ensuring the well-being of Native people. This is the third order President Biden has signed to strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship with Tribal Nations and deepen respect for Tribal sovereignty.
