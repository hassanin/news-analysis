The author, Hannah Ray, reflects on her experience as an intern in the White House and the impact the 2016-2017 class of White House Fellows had on her career goals. She describes how she was inspired by the accomplishments and personal stories of the Fellows, ranging from a Navy SEAL to the former Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley. Their advice, such as learning a foreign language and focusing on career goals rather than degrees, resonated with her and caused her to change her plans of attending law school and entering the private sector. Instead, she now aims to work in the public sector, specifically in foreign policy at the U.S. Department of State. Overall, the author credits the Fellows for shaping her career aspirations during her time as a White House intern.
