The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), signed 31 years ago, aimed to provide civil rights protections for disabled Americans. However, barriers still exist for people with disabilities in fully participating in various aspects of life. On the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the United States is partnering with other countries to discuss disability inclusive democracy as part of the U.S. Summit for Democracy. The discussion will focus on improving voting accessibility, supporting disabled political leaders, and expanding civic engagement. The Biden-Harris Administration has already taken steps towards creating a more disability inclusive democracy and plans to continue doing so in the coming year.
