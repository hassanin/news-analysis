This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama in 2015, establishing the Pullman National Monument in Chicago, Illinois. The Pullman National Historic Landmark District represents the economic, social, and design trends of the late 19th and early 20th century. It was built by industrialist George Mortimer Pullman as a model town for workers at his luxury rail car factories. However, the tight control over workers led to a significant labor strike. The remaining structures of the Pullman Palace Car Company, workers' housing, and community buildings in the Pullman Historic District are a testament to the evolution of American industry, the rise of unions, and the journey of the Pullman porters towards the civil rights movement. The proclamation highlights the significance of the Pullman Historic District in American history, including its architecture, urban planning, transportation, labor relations, and social history. It also emphasizes the importance of preserving and interpreting the history associated with the Pullman Company and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. The proclamation establishes the Pullman National Monument and outlines the management plan for the monument, including provisions for public involvement and coordination with relevant organizations.
