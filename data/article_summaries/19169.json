This article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney aboard Air Force One en route to Asheville, NC. Carney discusses the upcoming bus tour that President Obama will be embarking on through smaller communities in North Carolina and Virginia. The focus of the trip will be on the American Jobs Act and the need for Congress to take action on its individual components. Carney mentions that the Senate is expected to take up the first measure from within the jobs act soon, and he expresses frustration with Republicans for not putting forward a plan that would have a positive impact on economic growth or job creation. He also mentions that the President will be addressing the urgent need for near-term economic growth and job creation through various measures included in the jobs act, such as assistance to states and localities, infrastructure investment, and tax provisions. Carney states that all of these measures would have a positive impact on growth and job creation, but he doesn't specify which would have the most measurable impact. He also mentions that the first measure to be taken up by the Senate will likely be related to aid for states and local governments, specifically for protecting teachers' jobs. Carney mentions that the President understands the frustration expressed by the Occupy Wall Street protests and emphasizes the need to prevent a financial collapse like the one that led to the recession. He states that the President is focused on passing his jobs plan and believes that there is not a broad consensus among the American public to roll back Wall Street reforms or adopt economic policies that led to the recession.
