The President released a statement praising the House Energy and Commerce Committee for passing the "Home Star" legislation. He emphasized that this bipartisan vote is an important step in creating jobs, saving consumers money, and increasing energy efficiency. The Home Star legislation aims to provide up-front rebates to homeowners who invest in energy-saving measures such as insulation, HVAC systems, and energy-efficient windows. The President called this proposal a common-sense strategy to stimulate the economy and support American consumers. He thanked members of Congress from both parties for their support and expressed his eagerness to work with Congress to pass the bill promptly.
