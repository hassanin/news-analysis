During Antibiotic Awareness Week, the United States reaffirms its commitment to responsible antibiotic stewardship and acknowledges the contributions of American medical professionals. Antibiotics are critical tools in saving lives, but they have been overprescribed and overused. At least 47 million antibiotic prescriptions are written needlessly every year, leading to harmful side effects and the potential development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Overuse of antibiotics results in more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections and 35,000 deaths annually in the United States. However, efforts to combat antibiotic resistance have shown promising results, with deaths attributable to antibiotic resistance falling by 18 percent since 2013. The United States Government has taken steps to address this issue, including re-establishing the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria and releasing the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. The CDC's Antibiotic Resistance Solutions Initiative is ensuring educational resources on infection prevention, control, and antibiotic stewardship are available to healthcare professionals and the public. During Antibiotic Awareness Week, all Americans are urged to be good stewards of antibiotics and support the discovery of new therapeutic strategies and evidence-based prescribing practices to slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
