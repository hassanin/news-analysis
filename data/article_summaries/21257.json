The White House is holding an Easter Egg Roll Poster Contest for local school children. The First Lady will choose the winning design, which will become the official poster for the 2011 White House Easter Egg Roll. Elementary and middle school students in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia can submit their designs for consideration. The winning artist will be invited to attend the event along with their class. The Easter Egg Roll has been a tradition at the White House since the 1800s, and it has grown into a national event. This year's event will focus on promoting health and wellness with the theme "Get Up and Go!" Activities will include cooking stations, storytelling, sports, live entertainment, and Easter egg rolling. The event is part of the First Lady's "Let's Move!" initiative to combat childhood obesity. More information about the poster contest and ticketing details for the Easter Egg Roll can be found on the White House website.
