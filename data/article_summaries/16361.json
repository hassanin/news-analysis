This article discusses the implementation of missile defense in Europe, specifically the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) initiated by President Obama in 2009. The EPAA aims to protect the United States, U.S. deployed forces, European Allies, and partners against the threat of ballistic missiles. The article outlines the four phases of the EPAA, which involve deploying current and proven missile defense systems, expanding coverage against short- and medium-range threats, improving coverage against medium- and intermediate-range threats, and enhancing the ability to counter potential future inter-continental ballistic missile threats. The article also highlights the importance of cooperation with Russia and ongoing discussions on missile defense cooperation. The United States remains committed to cost-effective and proven missile defenses that can address emerging threats.
