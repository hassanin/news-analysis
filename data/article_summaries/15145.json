Secretary Clinton announced that the United States will provide $110 million in humanitarian aid to help Internally Displaced Persons in Pakistan. The aid will come from both the State Department and the Defense Department. The State Department will contribute $100 million, which will be used for family relief kits, tents, FM radios, generators, wheat, food items, and an emergency response center. The Defense Department will provide $10 million for water trucks, halal food, and large tents with environmental units. The relief effort will be led by Brigadier General Nadeem Ahmad, who successfully led relief efforts after the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir.
