During a speech at the South Court Auditorium, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed the gender wage gap and the economic challenges faced by women in the United States. She highlighted the fact that women are less likely to be hired, are paid less, and are promoted slower than equally qualified men. Women are also often excluded from high-paying industries and bear a disproportionate burden of unpaid caregiving responsibilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these inequities. Currently, women working full-time make, on average, 83 cents for every dollar that men make. For women of color, the wage gap is even wider, resulting in significant financial losses over the course of their careers. Lower wages also lead to lower Social Security benefits in retirement. The gender wage gap not only affects individual women's financial well-being but also has negative implications for productivity, job satisfaction, and the overall economy. Harris emphasized that closing the wage gap is not just a moral issue but also a business imperative. The Vice President outlined the steps the administration has taken to address pay equity, including passing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Additionally, the Office of Personnel Management will work to eliminate the use of salary history in the federal hiring and pay-setting process, and the President will sign an executive order directing the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to consider limiting the use of salary history by federal contractors. The Department of Labor will also strengthen pay audits for federal contractors to ensure equitable pay practices. Harris stressed the importance of collaboration and transparency in achieving pay equity and building a more fair and efficient economy that works for women and everyone.
