In this op-ed published in The New York Times, Vice President Joe Biden discusses the progress made in the recovery of the US economy since the implementation of the Recovery Act. He highlights that the Act includes tax cuts for 95% of working Americans and provides relief to state governments and individuals affected by the recession. Biden also emphasizes that the Act is financing investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and other areas, which will create jobs and support economic growth. He addresses criticisms by stating that projects are chosen without earmarks or political considerations, and many contracts have come in under budget. Biden acknowledges that the Recovery Act is not a cure-all solution but argues that it is already showing positive results in addressing the country's economic challenges.
