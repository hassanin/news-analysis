The article discusses the efforts of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to support emergency and disaster preparedness, recovery, and resilience in the region. The Asia-Pacific region has experienced numerous natural disasters in recent years, causing significant loss of lives and damage. The economic costs of these disasters are also substantial, affecting trade, supply chains, and critical infrastructure. APEC member economies, which account for a significant portion of the world's GDP, surface area, and population, experience over 70% of the world's natural disasters. In response to this, APEC has agreed to develop measures to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters. These measures include supporting effective public donation practices, facilitating the movement of emergency response personnel and goods across borders, establishing a trade recovery communications mechanism, assessing the economic value of coastal ecosystems for disaster risk reduction, increasing the resilience of supply chains, and developing emergency response mechanisms for energy infrastructure. APEC aims to improve coordination, information exchange, and collaboration among member economies to enhance disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts in the region.
