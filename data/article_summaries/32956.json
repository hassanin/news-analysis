President Trump has announced updated guidelines to slow the spread of the Coronavirus in America. These guidelines, developed by public health experts on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, emphasize the importance of social distancing, economic support for workers, medical intervention, innovation, and banning dangerous foreign travel. If every American follows these guidelines, it is estimated that 1 million or more U.S. lives could be saved. The next 30 days are crucial in containing the virus and protecting the most vulnerable. President Trump urges every American to do their patriotic duty to achieve a total victory over the virus.
