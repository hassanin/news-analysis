President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Tennessee and ordered federal aid to support recovery efforts in areas affected by severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding on March 3, 2020. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in Davidson, Putnam, and Wilson Counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work in the designated counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide can also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Myra M. Shird has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated as assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time. For further information, media should contact the FEMA News Desk.
