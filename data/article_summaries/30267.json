President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring October 11, 2018, as General Pulaski Memorial Day. This day commemorates the Polish immigrant and military commander, General Casimir Pulaski, who fought alongside the American forefathers during the American Revolutionary War. General Pulaski's bravery, tactical insights, and creation of a highly effective corps of mounted infantry earned him the title of "Father of the American Cavalry." Despite being severely wounded during the Battle of Savannah in 1779, General Pulaski's legacy of heroism and sacrifice is celebrated and inspires Americans today. The proclamation emphasizes the special bond between the American and Polish people and encourages all Americans to commemorate those who have contributed to the nation.
