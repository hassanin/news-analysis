In a recent speech, President Biden highlighted positive economic news, including the creation of 943,000 jobs in July and the advancement of the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the budget resolution. He also discussed the latest consumer price report, which showed a decrease in monthly core consumer prices. However, he acknowledged that many families are still struggling financially. To address this, he mentioned the American Rescue Plan and the monthly payments that families with children will receive. He also talked about easing global supply chain challenges, cracking down on practices that keep prices high, and addressing gas prices. President Biden emphasized the need for long-term plans to lower costs for families, such as investments in healthcare, prescription drugs, childcare, education, and housing. He also addressed concerns about inflation and the financial responsibility of his Build Back Better agenda.
