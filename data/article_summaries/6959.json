President Biden held the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon ceremony at the White House, continuing a tradition that dates back to President Truman. The turkeys, named Peanut Butter and Jelly, were selected based on their temperament, appearance, and vaccination status. The President thanked the farmers who raised the turkeys and the students who submitted their names. He also expressed gratitude for the frontline workers, scientists, and others who made it possible for Americans to gather with loved ones this Thanksgiving. President Biden pardoned both turkeys, Peanut Butter and Jelly, and wished everyone a happy Thanksgiving.
