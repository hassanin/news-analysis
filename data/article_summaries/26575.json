President Donald Trump has issued an executive order that amends a previous executive order related to Sudan. The new order changes certain effective dates and revokes a reporting requirement. The Secretary of State, in consultation with other officials, is now required to provide a report on Sudan's progress by October 12, 2017, instead of July 12, 2017. The effective date for the revocation of certain sections of previous executive orders has also been changed to October 12, 2017, contingent upon the Secretary of State publishing a notice stating that Sudan has sustained positive actions. The requirement to provide an updated version of the report annually has been revoked. The original executive orders were issued due to concerns about Sudan's support for terrorism, efforts to destabilize neighboring governments, and human rights violations. The decision to extend the review period was made to ensure that Sudan has demonstrated sufficient positive action across all areas.
