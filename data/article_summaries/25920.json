The Administration supports H.R. 1215, the Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017, which aims to address the rising cost of healthcare in the United States. The bill would limit non-economic damages to $250,000 and restrict the fees lawyers can charge in healthcare lawsuits. It would also establish a three-year statute of limitations for such lawsuits. The bill would apply to healthcare lawsuits where coverage was provided through a Federal program, subsidy, or tax benefit. The President's Fiscal Year 2018 budget proposal includes additional reforms to modify the collateral source rule, provide a safe harbor for providers, authorize the creation of expert panels and administrative healthcare tribunals, and exclude provider expressions of regret or apology from evidence in a healthcare lawsuit. The Administration encourages Congress to enact these additional medical malpractice reform proposals. If H.R. 1215 is presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he signs the bill into law.
