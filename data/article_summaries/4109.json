During National Women's Health Week, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reaffirms his commitment to women's health and well-being. He emphasizes the importance of protecting women's rights to make their own choices and build their own future, particularly in terms of reproductive health care. The president opposes the overturning of Roe v. Wade and is exploring ways to strengthen and protect women's access to reproductive health care. He supports the Women's Health Protection Act, which aims to ensure that all women have access to critical reproductive health care regardless of where they live.

President Biden believes that health care is a right, not a privilege, and gender equity in health care is a top priority for his administration. He is working to improve the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to ensure that all Americans, especially women, have access to quality health care. The ACA has already allowed millions of people to access health care, protected women with preexisting conditions from being denied coverage, and prevented women from being charged more for health insurance based on their gender.

The president also recognizes the importance of preventive care screenings and is committed to ensuring that women have access to life-saving screenings, such as cholesterol, blood pressure, and cancer screenings, that may have been skipped or delayed due to the pandemic. He acknowledges the need to improve maternal health care, as the maternal mortality rates in the United States, especially among Black and Native American women, are among the highest in the developed world. Through the American Rescue Plan, the president has provided states with the opportunity to extend postpartum coverage for pregnant women enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, aiming to lower mortality rates and improve the overall health of women.

Addressing the national mental health crisis is another priority for President Biden, as young women and girls are disproportionately affected by mental health conditions. He plans to broaden the pipeline of behavioral health providers, integrate mental health and substance use treatment into primary care, and expand access to virtual care options.

President Biden has been a long-time advocate for ending gender-based violence and trauma, having written the Violence Against Women Act in 1990. He worked with Congress to reauthorize it through 2027, aiming to increase support, funding, and resources for survivors and improve the health care system's response to domestic violence and sexual assault.

In conclusion, President Biden calls for a collective effort to improve the health of women and girls and promote health equity for all during National Women's Health Week. He encourages all women and girls, especially those with underlying health conditions, to prioritize their health and catch up on any missed screenings, routine care, and vaccines.
