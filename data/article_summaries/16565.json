The White House and the Department of Education have announced the Race to the Top High School Commencement Challenge. This challenge invites public schools across the country to compete for the chance to have President Obama speak at their graduation ceremony. The challenge aims to recognize schools that encourage reform and effective teaching methods, and prepare students for college and career success. High schools can submit their applications, which should include essays and optional supplemental materials such as videos and data on key indicators. Six finalists will be selected, and the public will have the opportunity to vote for the top three schools. The President will then choose the national winner and deliver the commencement address at their graduation. The application deadline is March 15th.
