President Biden has announced a series of actions aimed at lowering healthcare costs and cracking down on surprise fees for American families and consumers. These actions include cracking down on "junk insurance" plans that evade protections under the Affordable Care Act, preventing surprise medical billing, protecting consumers from unfair medical debt, and implementing an out-of-pocket spending cap for Medicare Part D enrollees starting in 2025. The administration is also collaborating with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, HHS, and Treasury to address the practice of signing up patients for third-party medical credit cards and loans. Data released by the Department of Health and Human Services shows that nearly 19 million seniors and other Medicare beneficiaries will save an estimated $400 per year in prescription drug costs once the out-of-pocket spending cap goes into effect. These actions build on previous efforts by the administration to eliminate hidden fees in various industries.
