The United States and Mexico have opened a new era of security cooperation focused on partnership and shared responsibility. The goal is to combat criminal groups involved in smuggling drugs, weapons, and engaging in human trafficking. The U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities outlines a comprehensive, long-term approach to ensure the safety and security of both societies. The framework aligns with the drug policy priorities of the Biden-Harris Administration, which emphasizes evidence-based public health and safety measures, racial equity, community-based crime prevention, and harm reduction efforts. Cabinet officials from both countries will meet annually to advance the implementation of the framework, while sub-cabinet officials will work towards these goals year-round. The cooperation aims to protect human rights, share information and best practices, prosecute violators of the law, and regularly evaluate the impact of their efforts. The framework has three main goals: to protect the people, prevent transborder crime, and pursue criminal networks by disrupting their financial networks and reducing their ability to profit from illicit activities.
