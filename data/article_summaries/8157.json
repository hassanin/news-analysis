The United States and Singapore are reaffirming their commitment to technology as a catalyst for inclusive economic growth and transformative societal change. They aim to foster open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystems based on mutual trust and a commitment to the rules-based international order. Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong delivered the opening remarks at the inaugural U.S.-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology (CET) Dialogue in Washington, D.C. The dialogue aims to build enduring collaboration across business, scientific, and national security communities to benefit both countries and their partners in ASEAN and the Indo-Pacific region. The United States and Singapore will also focus on combating the climate crisis and promoting innovation in low- and zero-emission technologies. The CET Dialogue will address risks, opportunities, and national security implications associated with emerging technologies in six main areas. Both countries will continue to strengthen their innovation ecosystems and coordinate efforts to deliver a brighter future for their peoples and the region. The next CET Dialogue will be held in Singapore in 2024.
