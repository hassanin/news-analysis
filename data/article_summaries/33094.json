The United States has expressed deep frustration with the leaders of South Sudan for their failure to end the country's civil war and address the humanitarian crisis. The US government has announced a comprehensive review of its assistance programs to South Sudan to ensure that its aid does not contribute to the conflict or facilitate corrupt behavior. The US remains committed to working with regional leaders to bring peace and stability to South Sudan, but emphasizes the need for an inclusive transitional government that reflects the country's diversity. The US will condemn any unilateral efforts by the current government to extend its power and calls for a negotiated agreement to lead the country towards a stable future.
