The Acting Administrator, Andy Slavitt, began the briefing by emphasizing the importance of accelerating the pace of vaccinations to combat the accelerating threat of the virus. The administration aims to have enough vaccines for all adults by the end of May and for 90% of adult Americans to be eligible for a vaccine by April 19th. The administration is also opening federally run mass vaccination sites and increasing the number of pharmacies administering vaccines. Dr. Walensky provided an overview of the state of the pandemic, with an increase in cases and hospitalizations. She highlighted the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color and the need for continued mitigation measures. Dr. Fauci discussed the potential role of vaccinations in handling virus variants, emphasizing the importance of both antibodies and T-cell responses in providing protection. The Q&A session covered topics such as the allocation of vaccine doses based on demand, concerns about the AstraZeneca vaccine, and the dominant variants in the US.
