President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring December 15, 2014, as Bill of Rights Day. The proclamation highlights the significance of the Bill of Rights, which was ratified on December 15, 1791, and secured fundamental freedoms for the American people. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of these rights, including the right to protest, practice religion, and hold the government accountable. It also acknowledges that the Bill of Rights was an imperfect document, with unresolved issues of race and gender. The proclamation calls for a continued commitment to the values of freedom, fairness, equality, and dignity, and encourages the American people to celebrate Bill of Rights Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
