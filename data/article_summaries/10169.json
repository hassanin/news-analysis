President Obama has designated the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in south-central New Mexico as part of his commitment to taking action using his pen and phone. The proclamation will permanently preserve approximately 496,000 acres of land, ensuring that the prehistoric, historic, and scientific values of the area remain for the benefit of all Americans. The designation is expected to generate $7.4 million in new economic activity each year. The area is home to a diverse range of animal and plant life, as well as culturally significant sites. The designation has received support from local communities, businesses, conservation groups, and sportsmen's organizations. The monument will be managed by the Bureau of Land Management and will provide opportunities for outdoor recreation such as hiking, biking, camping, and hunting. The designation is part of the Administration's efforts to promote conservation and support local economies through tourism.
