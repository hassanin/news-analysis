Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, Lisa Monaco, visited Saudi Arabia and Jordan to consult with key allies in the region about the threat from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and to build stronger regional partnerships. She discussed the immediate threat posed by ISIL to Iraq and the broader region, as well as the potential threat to the U.S. homeland if left unchecked. Monaco emphasized the importance of countering ISIL's territorial advances, supporting the formation of an inclusive Iraqi government, and fostering Sunni support for countering ISIL on their own territory. She highlighted the need to forge a coalition to counter ISIL by utilizing all elements of national power, including military, law enforcement, economic, diplomatic, intelligence, and humanitarian assistance. Monaco reiterated the President's commitment to go after ISIL members and assets wherever they are located and to lead an international coalition to degrade and defeat the group. She expressed gratitude to Saudi Arabia for their pledge of $500 million to help displaced Iraqis and thanked Jordan for hosting Syrian refugees, pledging ongoing U.S. support to both countries.
