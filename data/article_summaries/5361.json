Vice President Kamala Harris visited Unity Health Care in Washington, D.C. during National Health Center Week. She emphasized the importance of healthcare as a right, not a privilege, and the need for affordable health insurance for all Americans. Harris highlighted the Affordable Care Act's impact, with over 30 million people now having health insurance coverage. She also announced that over two and a half million people have signed up for health coverage since the special enrollment period began in February. Harris encouraged everyone to take advantage of the remaining six days of the enrollment period and sign up for health insurance at Healthcare.gov. She emphasized the importance of accessible and affordable healthcare, especially during the ongoing public health crisis. Harris also discussed the administration's efforts to lower healthcare costs through tax cuts and urged Congress to expand Medicaid in every state, include dental, vision, and hearing services with Medicare coverage, and negotiate lower prescription drug prices for seniors and families. She praised community health centers for their vital role in providing healthcare services and treating people with dignity and respect. Harris thanked healthcare workers for their sacrifice and dedication and urged everyone to spread the word about the enrollment period and sign up for coverage.
