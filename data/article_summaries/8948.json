President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed February 2023 as American Heart Month, emphasizing the importance of supporting the millions of Americans living with cardiovascular conditions. Heart disease is currently the leading cause of death in the United States, claiming nearly 700,000 lives annually. Almost half of all American adults have at least one major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, many heart conditions can be prevented through affordable healthcare, technological advancements, and lifestyle changes. The Biden administration has launched initiatives to drive breakthroughs in preventing, detecting, and treating life-threatening conditions like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer, which can also benefit cardiovascular health. The Inflation Reduction Act will cap out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 per year, making treatments more affordable. Additionally, efforts to reduce diet-related diseases include providing healthy meals to school children, expanding Medicaid and Medicare coverage for nutrition and obesity counseling, and increasing access to parks and exercise, especially in underserved communities. The Food and Drug Administration has proposed a rule to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes and flavored cigars, which are linked to heart disease. The importance of leading heart-healthy lifestyles, such as exercising regularly, maintaining a balanced diet, managing weight, and avoiding smoking or vaping, is highlighted. Raising awareness about the warning signs of heart attacks and strokes is also encouraged. Americans are invited to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 3, 2023, to bring attention to heart health.
