On National Air Traffic Control Day, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is recognized for their work in ensuring safe and efficient air travel across American-controlled airspace. Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, the FAA and its workforce have worked tirelessly to keep the skies open and safe. They have facilitated the return of US citizens from abroad and delivered essential supplies to medical workers. The aviation industry will play a crucial role in the nation's recovery from the pandemic and the restoration of the economy. The administration has provided approximately $10 billion through the CARES Act to support airports during these difficult times. The dedication and hard work of air traffic controllers and technicians help boost the economy, strengthen local communities, and connect millions of Americans to their jobs and loved ones every day.
