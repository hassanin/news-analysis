This article is a message from the White House to Congress regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. The President states that the crisis between the United States and Iran has not been resolved and that certain actions and policies of the Iranian government pose a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. Despite the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) between the P5+1 and Iran, which temporarily halted Iran's nuclear program, the President believes it is necessary to maintain comprehensive sanctions against Iran.
