Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. condemns the Israeli government's decision to advance planning for new housing units in East Jerusalem. He believes that this decision undermines the trust needed for constructive discussions and complicates negotiations. Biden emphasizes the need to begin negotiations to resolve all outstanding issues of the conflict. The United States recognizes the significance of Jerusalem for Israelis, Palestinians, and people of different religions. They believe that through good faith negotiations, both parties can reach an agreement that meets their aspirations and safeguards Jerusalem's status. Biden warns against unilateral actions that could prejudice the outcome of negotiations and calls for refraining from any statements or actions that may escalate tensions or prejudice the outcome of the talks.
