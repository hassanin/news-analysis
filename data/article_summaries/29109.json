On National Maritime Day, President Donald Trump recognizes the importance of the United States Merchant Marine in supporting commerce and national security. The president honors the history and contributions of merchant mariners in strengthening the economy. The maritime industry, including merchant mariners, plays a vital role in promoting economic growth and facilitating the export of goods. Merchant mariners also serve as a crucial defense force, protecting the homeland and sacrificing their lives for the country. National Maritime Day is observed on May 22 each year, commemorating the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship in 1819. President Trump calls upon the American people to mark the occasion by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes and in their communities, and requests that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
