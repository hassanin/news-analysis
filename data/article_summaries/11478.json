President Obama spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the situation in Syria and cooperation in fighting terrorism. They condemned recent terrorist attacks in Ankara and Diyarbakir Province, and President Obama expressed concern about Syrian regime advances in northwest Syria. He called for a halt to actions that heighten tensions with Turkey and the moderate opposition forces in northern Syria. President Obama stressed that YPG forces should not seize additional territory and urged Turkey to cease artillery strikes in the area. Both leaders supported the understanding reached in Munich on the cessation of hostilities in Syria and called on Russia and the Assad regime to halt airstrikes against moderate opposition forces. They also pledged to deepen cooperation in fighting terrorism, including the PKK, and to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.
