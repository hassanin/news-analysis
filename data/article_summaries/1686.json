President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued an Executive Order terminating the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13928, which had blocked property of certain persons associated with the International Criminal Court (ICC). The President determined that the imposition of financial sanctions against the ICC and its personnel is not an effective or appropriate strategy for addressing the United States' concerns with the ICC. Therefore, the national emergency has been terminated and the blocking of assets and other sanctions measures imposed by Executive Order 13928 have been revoked.
