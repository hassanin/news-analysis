President Obama has granted commutations to 98 individuals who were serving prison sentences for drug offenses. The commutations vary in length, with some individuals having their sentences commuted to a specific term of imprisonment and others having their sentences commuted to expire on a certain date. Many of the individuals were convicted of offenses related to the distribution or possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, also known as crack cocaine. The commutations are conditioned upon enrollment in residential drug treatment for some of the individuals.
