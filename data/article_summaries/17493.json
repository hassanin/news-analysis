President Obama has declared a state of emergency in Louisiana due to flooding that began on April 25, 2011. This declaration authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to save lives, protect property, and ensure public health and safety in several parishes in Louisiana. FEMA is authorized to mobilize resources and equipment necessary to mitigate the impacts of the emergency. The federal government will provide 75 percent of the funding for emergency protective measures. Gerald M. Stolar has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. For more information, contact FEMA.
