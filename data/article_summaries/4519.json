Vice President Kamala Harris participated in a listening session with voting rights advocates in Greenville, South Carolina. The group discussed efforts to register voters, strengthen election infrastructure, and expand voting rights through proposed bills. Harris expressed her gratitude for their work and the Administration's support. This was Harris' first on-the-ground meeting regarding voting rights. Tomorrow, she will meet with members of the Texas state legislature who blocked a bill that would restrict voting rights.
