At the Summit of the Americas, President Biden will announce the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, a new agreement aimed at driving economic recovery and growth in the Western Hemisphere. The region, which accounts for 31.9% of global GDP, has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with Latin America and the Caribbean experiencing the deepest economic contraction. The partnership will focus on rebuilding economies from the bottom up and middle out, strengthening supply chains, fostering innovation, and addressing the climate crisis. It will also support U.S. businesses and workers and promote hemispheric recovery, resilience, and stability. Initial consultations will be held with partners and stakeholders following the conclusion of the summit.
