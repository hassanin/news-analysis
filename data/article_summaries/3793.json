On November 22, 2021, the President signed two bills into law. The first one is H.R. 2093, also known as the "Veterans and Family Information Act." This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide its fact sheets in specified languages. The second bill is H.R. 2911, called the "VA Transparency & Trust Act of 2021." This bill mandates that the VA report to Congress a plan for using the appropriations allocated to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The President thanked the representatives and senators for their leadership in passing these bills.
