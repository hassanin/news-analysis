President Obama visited Lorain County Community College in Ohio to highlight how federal job training funding is helping unemployed workers find jobs in high-demand industries. The college's Transformations program for Computerized Numerically Controlled Machining has successfully placed over 90% of participants in jobs within three months of graduation. Lorain County has experienced significant job losses, particularly in manufacturing, and the college has worked with partners to develop training programs to meet the needs of employers. However, the House of Representatives passed a Budget Resolution that would reduce funding for programs like these. The proposed cuts would eliminate services for thousands of Ohioans and millions of job-seekers nationwide. President Obama believes in investing in workforce training and has made historic investments in community colleges. He has also proposed new initiatives, such as the Community College to Career Fund and the Universal Displaced Worker program, to help train workers for high-growth industries and provide job-search assistance.
