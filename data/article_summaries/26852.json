President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation in honor of National Maritime Day, which recognizes the men and women who have served in the United States Merchant Marine. The proclamation acknowledges the important role of merchant mariners in fueling the economy, maintaining sea power, and supporting national security. It highlights how merchant mariners extend goodwill internationally and facilitate the import and export of goods. During times of war, they provide sealift for the Department of Defense. The proclamation also emphasizes the need to encourage more people, including veterans, to pursue career opportunities in the Merchant Marine. National Maritime Day is observed on May 22 each year, commemorating the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship in 1819. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to mark the occasion by displaying the flag and requests that ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
