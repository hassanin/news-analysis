President Donald J. Trump has authorized economic sanctions and visa restrictions against officials of the International Criminal Court (ICC) who are involved in investigating or prosecuting United States personnel without the consent of the United States. The United States is not a State Party to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, and has consistently rejected the court's jurisdiction over its personnel. The Trump administration considers the ICC's actions to be an attack on American rights and national sovereignty. They argue that the ICC has been ineffective, politically motivated, and targets US personnel, as well as allies and partners. The US and its allies have called for reforms within the ICC, but no action has been taken. The US also expresses concern that adversary nations are manipulating the ICC by encouraging allegations against American personnel. The Trump administration believes there is corruption and misconduct at the highest levels of the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor, which calls into question the integrity of its investigations into American service members. The US will use any necessary means to protect its citizens and allies from unjust prosecution by the ICC.
