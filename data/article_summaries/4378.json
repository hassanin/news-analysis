President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq, declared in Executive Order 13303, will continue beyond May 22, 2022. This decision is based on the obstacles faced in the reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of peace and security, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in the country, which continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
