The President has announced that the United States will be imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine. These sanctions will target Russia's financial, energy, and defense sectors, increasing Russia's political isolation and economic costs. The President expressed that the international community is still seeking a negotiated solution to the crisis in Ukraine and encouraged President Putin to work towards a lasting resolution. The President also stated that if Russia fulfills its commitments, the sanctions can be rolled back, but if Russia continues its aggressive actions, the costs will continue to rise.
