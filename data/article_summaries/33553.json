This determination states that the domestic production capability for separation and processing of Heavy Rare Earth Elements is essential to national defense. Without Presidential action, the United States industry would not be able to provide this production capability adequately and in a timely manner. The memorandum authorizes and directs the Secretary of Defense to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
