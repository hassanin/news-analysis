The United States is working with Indonesia to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat the effects of climate change. This includes improving forest and land management, promoting clean energy technologies, and providing technical assistance for scientific capacity related to climate change. The U.S. has partnerships in Indonesia worth approximately $60 million through debt-for-nature swaps and $50 million through the Millennium Challenge Corporation's compact. Programs are focused on conserving ecosystems, adapting to climate change, and helping communities. The U.S. is also supporting the training of Indonesian scientists and forging ties between U.S. and Indonesian universities. Additionally, funds are being allocated to strengthen the workforce and drive Indonesia's low carbon development strategy.
