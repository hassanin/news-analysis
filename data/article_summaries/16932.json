This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating the continuation of the national emergency regarding the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the Russian Federation. The President issued an executive order in 2000, blocking property and interests in property of the Russian government in the United States. This order invoked the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and declared a national emergency to address the threat to national security and foreign policy posed by the accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in Russia. The national emergency, which was declared in 2000, is set to continue beyond June 21, 2012, to provide continued protection for the property and interests of the Russian government that are directly related to the implementation of agreements concerning the disposition of highly enriched uranium. The continuation of the national emergency has been authorized for one year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
