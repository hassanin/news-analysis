In this proclamation, President Donald J. Trump recognizes the American Red Cross for its humanitarian mission and acknowledges its contributions to the nation's healthcare system. The American Red Cross is the largest supplier of blood and blood products in the United States, providing vital resources for accident and burn victims, patients requiring transfusions, and those undergoing advanced medical treatments. The organization also assists millions of people affected by domestic and international disasters each year. Additionally, the American Red Cross plays a crucial role in supporting military service members and their families through various programs and resources. The proclamation declares March 2018 as American Red Cross Month and encourages Americans to support the organization and participate in related activities.
