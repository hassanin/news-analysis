The article discusses the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 by the House of Representatives. The White House Press Secretary states that this agreement is a positive step for the nation and the economy. The President had called for Congress to work together on a budget that promotes economic growth, job creation, and investments to strengthen the middle class.
