Deputy National Security Advisory for Cyber and Emerging Technologies, Anne Neuberger, recently visited the Republic of Korea (ROK) to strengthen cyber cooperation between the U.S. and ROK. This visit follows President Biden's commitment to expand bilateral cooperation on cyber issues and address cyber threats, including those from North Korea. During her meetings with Korean counterparts, Neuberger emphasized the Biden-Harris Administration's dedication to securing critical infrastructure and government systems, preparing for cyber incidents, upholding international law and responsible behavior, and collaborating to deter disruptive cyber activity. She also highlighted the U.S.'s commitment to working with the ROK to combat cybercrime, secure cryptocurrency, build capacity, and share information.
