Vice President Biden spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to congratulate him on the selection and approval of seven new cabinet ministers, including ministers of Defense, Finance, and Interior. This marks the first time since 2010 that Iraq has a full slate of national security ministers approved by the Council of Representatives. They also discussed the steps needed to rebuild Iraq's security forces and involve all communities in the fight against ISIL.
