This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama regarding the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The proclamation states that certain submerged lands surrounding the islands of Farallon de Pajaros (Uracas), Maug, and Asuncion are ecologically diverse and have been protected as part of the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument. However, certain submerged lands adjacent to the leased lands on the islands of Tinian and Farallon de Medinilla are necessary for military training and ensuring the safety of citizens. These lands will not be transferred to the government of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, unless otherwise designated by the President. The proclamation also mentions that the Secretary of the Interior has the authority to convey the submerged lands under certain conditions that ensure the protection of the marine national monument and military training.
