During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary, Eric Schultz, announced that the Senate has passed key portions of the legislative proposal on cybersecurity that President Obama sent to Congress in January. The President and his administration are encouraged by this development as cyber threats pose serious economic and national security challenges for the nation. The legislative proposal aims to facilitate greater information-sharing while protecting privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties. Schultz also mentioned that the Senate’s passage of the bill is an important step towards better protecting the nation’s networks from cyber threats.

Schultz was asked about the President’s expectations for the next round of international talks on Syria, now that Iran has accepted the invitation to join. He stated that the President is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict in Syria. Iran has been invited to the talks, and Schultz emphasized that the invitation does not overlook Iran’s ongoing relationship with Syria, including its support for the Assad regime and terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. The goal of the talks is to find a political solution that results in a government that is more responsive to the Syrian people.

On the topic of talks between China and the United States regarding the South China Sea, Schultz stated that the US policies are intended to advance strategic objectives in the Asia Pacific region, including protecting the rights and freedoms of all nations under international law. He mentioned that the recent operation conducted by the US in the South China Sea was in accordance with international law and applied evenhandedly globally.

Schultz was also asked about Paul Ryan potentially becoming the new Speaker of the House. While Schultz acknowledged that the President has worked with Ryan on certain issues, he expressed concern that Republicans are spending too much time consolidating their caucus instead of working towards a more bipartisan approach to governing.

Lastly, Schultz mentioned that President Obama will be meeting with Prince Harry in the Oval Office to thank him for his work on behalf of wounded warriors and to discuss the upcoming Invictus Games. The meeting is a sign of the special relationship between the US and the UK.
