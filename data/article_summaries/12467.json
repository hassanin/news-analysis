In this statement, National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice addresses the people of South Sudan on the occasion of their fourth anniversary of independence. She recalls the joy felt by the world when South Sudan became a nation, but acknowledges that the country has since experienced massive violence and human rights abuses. Rice holds President Kiir and Riek Machar responsible for the current situation, as they prioritize personal power and wealth over finding solutions. She emphasizes the suffering of the South Sudanese people, with almost half the population dependent on international aid and millions displaced from their homes. Rice criticizes the government for failing to protect its citizens and extending its mandate unilaterally, which threatens to destabilize the region. She expresses support for efforts made by regional partners to end the conflict and calls for the establishment of a transitional government that represents the needs of the people. Rice assures that the United States will continue to stand with the people of South Sudan and work towards lasting peace and justice.
