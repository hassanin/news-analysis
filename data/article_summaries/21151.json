The President has signed the National Strategy for the Arctic Region, joining other Arctic Council countries in establishing strategic priorities for the region. The strategy was developed with input from Alaska Natives, the State of Alaska, and other stakeholders. Successful implementation of the strategy depends on active engagement with these groups. To further demonstrate commitment to their input, Administration officials will be hosting roundtable discussions in Alaska to discuss how to move forward with the strategy's concepts. The meetings will include high-level officials and will be held in mid-June at a yet-to-be-confirmed location.
