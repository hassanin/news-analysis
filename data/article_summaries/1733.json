In Proclamation 10467, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. granted a pardon to individuals who committed or were convicted of the offense of simple possession of marijuana. The pardon aims to remove barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities that have been imposed by convictions for simple possession of marijuana. The pardon also extends to individuals who may continue to face collateral consequences of a conviction for attempted simple possession of marijuana or use of marijuana. The pardon applies to both federal offenses and violations of the Code of the District of Columbia. However, it does not cover offenses involving other controlled substances or activities beyond simple possession, such as possession with intent to distribute or driving offenses under the influence of marijuana. The pardon does not apply to individuals who were non-citizens not lawfully present in the United States at the time of their offense. The Attorney General, through the Pardon Attorney, will review applications for certificates of pardon and issue them to eligible applicants.
