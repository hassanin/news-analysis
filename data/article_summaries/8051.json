The Biden-Harris Administration has made racial equity a priority since day one, directing every federal agency to address systemic racism and its impact on Black communities. They recognize that entrenched disparities in society and the economy have made it harder for Black Americans to achieve the American dream. President Biden recently signed an Executive Order on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Black Americans. The Administration has already taken significant actions to address systemic racism, such as implementing the American Rescue Plan to help Black Americans own homes and expanding access to wealth creation through small business ownership. They are also working to ensure equitable educational opportunities, improve health outcomes for Black communities, reform the criminal justice system, protect voting rights, and reduce barriers for Black communities facing natural disasters. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to promoting equity and racial justice for Black Americans as they continue to rebuild and strengthen the country.
