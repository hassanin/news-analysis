The author, who is the President of the United States, discusses the importance of reopening schools safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. They set a goal to open most K-8 schools by the end of their first 100 days in office. The author emphasizes that this goal can only be achieved if Congress provides the necessary resources through the American Rescue Plan. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided guidelines on how to reopen schools safely, which include measures such as appropriate distancing, mask-wearing, handwashing, testing, and contact tracing. Meeting these guidelines may require additional teachers, support staff, buses, spaces, and protective equipment, which all come with a cost. However, the author argues that the cost of inaction is much greater, as it affects the education, mental health, and economic opportunities of children, families, and educators. The author calls for support from Congress and urges states to prioritize vaccinating teachers. They also plan to work with school administrators, educators, and parents to expedite the reopening process. The author concludes by emphasizing the need to act quickly and pass the American Rescue Plan for the benefit of children, families, communities, and the country.
