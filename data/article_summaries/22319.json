In a phone call, President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed recent developments in the P5+1 negotiations with Iran and Israeli-Palestinian relations. Obama reaffirmed the US's commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and emphasized the importance of cooperation with Israel. On the Palestinian bid to join the ICC, Obama reiterated that the US does not consider Palestine a state and does not see ICC accession as a constructive way forward. The US opposes actions that undermine trust and encourages deescalation of tensions.
