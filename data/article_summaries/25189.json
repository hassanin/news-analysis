The Presidential Task Force on Protecting Native American Children in the Indian Health Service System (Task Force) held its first meeting on April 4, 2019. The Task Force was created by the President to address the issue of predatory abuse of Native American children in the care of the Indian Health Service (IHS). The Task Force is led by co-chairs Joseph Grogan and Trent Shores and includes experts, federal employees, and tribal leaders. In the inaugural meeting, the Task Force discussed its mission and goals, including seeking input from Native Americans on the IHS system. They also heard from Muscogee (Creek) Nation Principal Chief James Floyd, Dr. Mark Butterbrodt, and Inspector Curt Muller. The Task Force explored issues related to healthcare provider recruitment and retention, relationships with authorities, and cultural topics. The Task Force will meet again in South Dakota and Montana after completing its initial deliverables. It is important to note that the Task Force's work is separate from other investigations into the IHS and will not interfere with ongoing criminal investigations or reviews.
