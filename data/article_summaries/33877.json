President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Tennessee and ordered federal assistance to support state and local recovery efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The declaration makes federal funding available to the state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency protective measures and direct federal assistance. Gracia B. Szczech has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further assessments.
