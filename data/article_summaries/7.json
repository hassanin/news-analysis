The United States is committed to an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient. To achieve this, the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) and Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) will work with IPEF partners and the private sector to scale high-standard investments, create resilient economies, and drive sustainable development. The PGI IPEF Investment Forum was held to discuss collaborative actions and shared priorities to increase private investment in the Indo-Pacific. The United States will continue to engage the private sector to explore investment opportunities in emerging markets. In 2024, IPEF partners will host an annual IPEF Clean Economy Investor Forum to promote sustainable infrastructure and climate technology investments. The United States also announced the PGI IPEF Investment Accelerator, which aims to scale high-standard project financing for sustainable economic growth in IPEF countries. Additionally, the U.S. government will contribute $15 million to the IPEF Project Preparation Facility, which supports project planning and technical assistance. The United States and its IPEF partners are mobilizing investment through programs, incentives, and partnerships, including the establishment of the IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund to expand the pipeline of climate projects. The U.S. Department of Commerce has entered into a public-private partnership to strengthen supply chains, promote environmental sustainability, upskill workers, and support economic opportunity in the Indo-Pacific. Tens of billions of dollars of investments from the U.S. government and private sector have been highlighted to boost economic development and connectivity in the Indo-Pacific region.
