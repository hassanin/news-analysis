The United States and Indonesia have committed to expanding their partnership on energy development in order to promote clean energy technologies, improve energy access, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. is supporting energy development in Indonesia through investments from agencies such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. is also working with Indonesia to achieve its power generation targets, particularly in the renewable energy sector. USAID is promoting and accelerating the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency in Indonesia through technical assistance activities and the Indonesia Clean Energy Development (ICED II) Project. The U.S. Department of Energy is funding the Sustainable Energy for Remote Indonesian Grids (SERIG) initiative to support clean energy development and increase access to electricity in remote areas of Indonesia. Additionally, the United States and Indonesia are collaborating on financing structures and risk mitigation tools to accelerate geothermal investments in Indonesia, which has significant geothermal resources.
