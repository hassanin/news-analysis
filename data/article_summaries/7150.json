April is recognized as Second Chance Month, a time to emphasize the importance of supporting individuals who have been previously incarcerated as they reintegrate into society. The United States is seen as a nation that believes in second chances, and it is crucial for the criminal and juvenile justice systems to provide meaningful opportunities for rehabilitation and redemption. This involves addressing the root causes of crime, as well as the needs of returning citizens, through prevention, diversion, reentry, trauma-informed care, culturally-specific services, and social support.

Each year, more than 640,000 people are released from state and federal prisons, and over 70 million Americans have a criminal record that presents significant barriers to employment, economic stability, and successful reentry. Legal and regulatory restrictions limit access to employment, housing, voting, education, business licensing, and other opportunities, resulting in nearly 75 percent of formerly incarcerated individuals remaining unemployed a year after their release.

To create a more equitable and effective criminal and juvenile justice system, it is necessary to rethink who is sent to prison and for how long, address unaddressed trauma and abuse that contribute to incarceration, improve treatment of incarcerated individuals, prepare them for reentry, and address racial inequities that lead to disproportionate numbers of incarcerated people of color and other underserved groups.

The Biden Administration recognizes the need for a holistic approach to make the criminal and juvenile justice systems more equitable, just, and effective. This involves eliminating excessively long sentences and mandatory minimums, providing quality job training and educational opportunities during incarceration, offering opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals to enter the workforce and access stable housing, reuniting with their families, and obtaining healthcare. It also includes expunging and sealing certain criminal records to prevent individuals from being defined by their past.

The Administration is working across federal agencies to eliminate barriers to reentry by expanding avenues for employment, housing, education, health services, civic engagement, and other benefits. Efforts are being made to reduce crime, recidivism, mass incarceration, and the elements of the justice system that disproportionately impact people of color and historically disadvantaged communities.

Despite progress, there is still much work to be done. Federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal governments, along with private employers, philanthropies, and community leaders, all have a significant role in preparing individuals returning to communities for success. The proclamation calls for a recommitment to empower Americans who have paid their debt to society and provide them with a second chance to participate, contribute, and succeed.

In conclusion, April 2022 has been proclaimed as Second Chance Month by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The proclamation encourages government officials, educators, volunteers, and all Americans to observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
