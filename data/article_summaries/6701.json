President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed May 16 through May 22, 2021, as World Trade Week. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy, threatening workers and employers who rely on trade. The United States aims to out-compete any country by investing in American innovation and competitiveness, creating jobs, and supporting working families. The administration plans to make the largest investment in American innovation and competitiveness since World War II through the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. The four major challenges to be addressed include strengthening the industrial and innovation base, investing in sustainable infrastructure and clean energy, supporting the caring economy, and advancing racial equity. The United States is committed to enforcing trade rules, promoting equitable growth, protecting workers' rights, and addressing environmental justice. By investing in America and leading in global trade, the United States aims to create more opportunities for workers and businesses, making the country stronger and more prosperous. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe World Trade Week and celebrate with appropriate programs and activities.
