The Second Lady, Karen Pence, visited a National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE) and heard about the teamwork involved in helping service members recover from traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She spent time with Corporal Joseph Lange, who shared his healing journey after a brain injury and how his music therapist, Rebecca Vaudreuil, helped him return to playing guitar. Lange is now mentoring another service member and has positive plans for the future, including finishing college, possibly going to law school, and getting married. Pence also participated in roundtable discussions with military spouses at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and Camp Pendleton.
