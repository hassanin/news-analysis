President Obama is scheduled to visit Allison Transmission in Indianapolis on May 6. During his visit, he will tour the facilities and speak to workers about his long-term plan to protect consumers against rising oil prices and decrease oil imports. Allison Transmission is a leader in hybrid technology and the world's largest manufacturer of fully-automatic transmissions for commercial and military vehicles. They employ approximately 2,500 workers in Indiana and recently announced plans to expand, creating up to 205 new jobs by 2013. The company's hybrid-propulsion systems for buses have already saved more than 17 million gallons of diesel fuel. President Obama's goal is to cut America's oil imports by one-third by 2025, and his plan includes producing more oil domestically, using cleaner fuels, and increasing efficiency. The Obama Administration has made progress in clean energy investments, implementing new fuel economy standards, and calling for an end to subsidies for oil and gas companies. These actions aim to reduce the country's dependence on oil.
