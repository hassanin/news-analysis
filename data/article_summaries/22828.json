Governor Chet Culver is expressing his support for President Obama's efforts to extend unemployment insurance, tax cuts for working families, and other tax incentives. He is also advocating for an extension on ethanol tax credits, stating that it is crucial for creating new jobs in Iowa. Without the extension, over 8,000 Iowa families would lose their benefits during the holiday season. The Governor believes that the ethanol industry is a growth industry that offers well-paying jobs for Iowans.
