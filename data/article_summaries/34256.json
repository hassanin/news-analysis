Under President Trump, small businesses in the US are experiencing high levels of optimism, increasing wages, and planning to expand. According to the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey, small business owners have increased expectations for higher revenue and are planning to hire more staff. The sweeping federal tax cuts have also had a positive impact on small businesses, with many using their savings to invest, hire more workers, and give out raises. Small business employees have seen their wages grow at the strongest rate in over two years. Business owners in Ohio and Pennsylvania are particularly optimistic, with record levels of confidence in profits, hiring, and the economy. The overall outlook for small and medium-sized businesses in Florida is also positive, with high levels of optimism leading to plans for increased employee compensation.
