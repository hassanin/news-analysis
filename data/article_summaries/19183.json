The United States has taken several steps in the last 18 months to assure its allies in Europe and demonstrate its commitment to NATO collective defense. Operation ATLANTIC RESOLVE (OAR) is a demonstration of the US dedication to peace and stability in the North Atlantic area. The US has enhanced the frequency and complexity of exercises with NATO allies and partners, and increased its air, ground, and naval presence in the region. The European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) has also been implemented to fund increased activities such as rotational presence, training, prepositioning of equipment, infrastructure improvement, and capacity building with newer NATO allies. The US has also increased the frequency and length of its deployments to Europe, including the deployment of armored brigade combat teams, mission command elements, and various aircraft. Additionally, NATO and multinational exercises have been conducted to train the enhanced NATO Response Force and improve interoperability among participating nations. These efforts aim to shift from assurance to deterrence and strengthen the US and NATO's defense posture.
