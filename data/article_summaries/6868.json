President Biden delivered a speech in Philadelphia addressing the threats to voting rights and the integrity of elections. He criticized the voter suppression laws that have been passed in several states and emphasized the importance of legislation, such as the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, to protect voting rights. The President called these new laws a significant threat to the integrity of elections and the right to vote. He also urged the formation of a coalition of advocates, activists, students, faith leaders, labor leaders, and business executives to combat these efforts. Additionally, Vice President Harris met with Texas legislators who broke quorum to block restrictive voting legislation. There is growing bipartisan support in Congress for the bipartisan infrastructure framework, which includes significant investments in roads, bridges, broadband, clean energy, and rail. The U.S. Conference of Mayors has advocated for the quick passage of this framework. Furthermore, Olivia Rodrigo will visit the White House to record videos promoting the importance of young people getting vaccinated. In the press briefing, it was mentioned that Senator Sanders and the President agree on including key priorities in the budget resolution, but no specific topline figure was discussed. The President believes in making the filibuster work the way it used to and supports the Texas Democrats who fled the state to block anti-voter legislation. The administration is closely monitoring the situations in Haiti and Cuba and is assessing whether to offer support. In terms of infrastructure, the White House believes the offsets proposed in the bipartisan framework are reasonable and responsible. There is evidence that infrastructure investment can pay for itself in the long run. The status of the Russian gang responsible for the Kaseya hack is unknown, and all members of the U.S. delegation in Haiti have returned.
