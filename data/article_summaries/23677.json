The Chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, Christina Romer, commented on the employment situation in October. She noted that while there were signs of hope for recovery, there was also evidence of continued weakness in the labor market. Payroll employment declined by 190,000, but this was a continuation of the trend of moderating job loss that began earlier in the year. The employment loss in August and September was also revised down substantially. There were some positive signs, such as an increase in employment in temporary help services and the motor vehicle industry. However, the unemployment rate rose by four-tenths of a percentage point to 10.2 percent. Romer explained that this increase in unemployment despite the rise in real GDP last quarter was due to the typical lag between GDP growth and unemployment decline, as well as recent exceptional increases in productivity. She emphasized that there was still a lot of work to be done before American families would see the job gains and reduced unemployment that they need and deserve.
