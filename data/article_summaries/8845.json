National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese co-hosted a virtual event with Ambassadors and Permanent Representatives from island countries and territories in the Caribbean, North Atlantic, and Pacific regions. They discussed the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic and the climate crisis, which have disproportionately affected import and tourism-dependent island economies. The Biden Administration emphasized its commitment to strengthening relationships with allies and partners, including smaller countries that have been overlooked in the past. Sullivan and Deese invited participants to collaborate with the United States under the Small and Less Populous Island Economies (SALPIE) Initiative, which aims to enhance cooperation to address the economic challenges of COVID-19, promote recovery, tackle the climate crisis, and pursue shared long-term interests.
