Vice President Joe Biden announced that the weatherization of 200,000 homes has been completed under the Recovery Act. This initiative has allowed low-income families to save money on their energy bills while also saving energy. The program has created jobs for construction workers across the country who are making energy-saving home improvements. The goal is to weatherize 600,000 homes nationwide. New Hampshire has been a leader in weatherization efforts and has already weatherized over 1,000 homes. The Weatherization Assistance Program is now weatherizing homes at an optimal rate of approximately 25,000 homes per month. In addition to saving energy and money, the program has created thousands of jobs locally. The U.S. Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program helps lower-income families improve the energy efficiency of their homes, resulting in average savings of over $400 in energy costs during the first year. Overall, the Administration is investing $90 billion in clean energy and energy-efficiency projects through the Recovery Act.
