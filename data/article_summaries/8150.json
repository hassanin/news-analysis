President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have announced the establishment of the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database, the first-ever federal database to track official records of law enforcement officer misconduct. The database aims to ensure that federal agencies have access to records of serious misconduct when hiring federal law enforcement officers. This initiative is part of a larger effort to promote police accountability and strengthen trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. The announcement comes after President Biden and Vice President Harris issued an Executive Order last year banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and strengthening use-of-force policies for federal law enforcement. They are also urging Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which they co-authored while serving in the Senate.
