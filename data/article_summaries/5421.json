In a recent press briefing, Acting Administrator Slavitt provided an update on the partnership between Johnson & Johnson and Merck to expand the production of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine. The U.S. government has invested over $100 million to increase drug substance manufacturing and convert a Merck plant for fill-and-finish production. Both companies are working together to increase vaccine production and have implemented measures to maximize output. The Biden administration is also providing logistical support, and a team of experts and equipment manufacturers has been deployed to support faster ramp-up. The goal is to have enough vaccine supply for every American adult by the end of May. Additionally, a new pilot program has been launched by health insurance providers to vaccinate 2 million vulnerable seniors. The program, called Vaccine Community Connectors, aims to address barriers such as vaccine questions, scheduling, and transportation.
