In this article, President Barack Obama promises to reduce the budget deficit and mentions specific measures taken towards that goal. He praises the Senate for restoring the law that requires paying incurred expenses, which contributed to a surplus of $236 billion in the late 1990s. He also proposes freezing discretionary spending, increasing job-generating investments, cutting taxes for the middle class, and reducing spending on redundant or ineffective programs. Additionally, the President suggests the creation of a Fiscal Commission with members from both parties to develop concrete proposals for deficit reduction.
