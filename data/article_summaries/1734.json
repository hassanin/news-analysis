The Biden-Harris administration is issuing new sanctions against actors in Russia and Iran who have engaged in the wrongful detention and hostage-taking of Americans. These sanctions are part of the administration's efforts to prioritize the safe return of Americans held overseas. The sanctions are being imposed under Executive Order 14078, which was signed by President Biden last summer and builds on the 2020 Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act. The first set of sanctions announced today target Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Intelligence Organization (IRGC-IO), as well as four individuals associated with the IRGC-IO. The FSB has been involved in the arrest, investigation, and detention of U.S. nationals wrongfully detained in Russia, while the IRGC-IO frequently holds and interrogates detainees, including U.S. nationals, in Evin Prison in Iran. The sanctions aim to impose costs on those who engage in wrongful detention and hostage-taking, and to deter such behavior in the future. The administration remains committed to reuniting Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained with their families. These sanctions are part of a broader effort, including diplomatic negotiations, to secure the release of Americans and promote accountability for the culprits. The administration believes that sanctions can incentivize better behavior and contribute to the resolution of cases. The President has spoken with some families of Americans held abroad, but meeting with the President is not a determinant of effort or result. The administration continues to engage with families and work towards the release of their loved ones. The timing of these sanctions was not directly prompted by any specific case, but the detention of Evan Gershkovich by Russia reinforces the unacceptable behavior that the sanctions target. The planning for these sanctions was underway before Gershkovich's detention.
