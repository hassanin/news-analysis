President Obama expresses his gratitude to General John Allen as he prepares to leave his role as Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL. He commends Allen for his ability and courage in building a robust international coalition that has made significant progress in degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. The United States is leading a 65-member global coalition that is rolling back ISIL's territorial gains, advising and assisting Iraqi Security Forces, and countering ISIL's message. President Obama welcomes Brett McGurk, Allen's Deputy, as the new Special Presidential Envoy for the Counter ISIL campaign. McGurk has been a trusted adviser on Iraq and will work to broaden and deepen coalition efforts, strengthen the partnership with Iraq, and work with regional partners to end the civil war in Syria.
