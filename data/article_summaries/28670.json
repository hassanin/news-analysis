Secretary Zinke announced that President Trump will sign an executive order to review the Antiquities Act. The executive order will direct Secretary Zinke to review prior monument designations and suggest legislative changes or modifications to the monuments. The review will cover monuments designated since January 1, 1996, that are 100,000 acres or larger. Secretary Zinke will provide an interim report to the President within 45 days and a final report within 120 days. The goal of the review is to give states and local communities a voice in the management of federal lands. The executive order does not strip any monument of its designation or loosen any environmental regulations. Secretary Zinke also addressed concerns about potential job losses and the transfer of public lands, stating that the review is not intended to lead to those outcomes. He emphasized the importance of managing federal lands for multiple uses and giving the public a voice in the process. The Secretary expects to have a recommendation on the Bears Ears National Monument within 45 days.
