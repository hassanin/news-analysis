The bipartisan Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity will hold its next meeting on September 12, 2017, at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. The meeting will be chaired by Vice Chair Kris Kobach, as the Vice President will not be in attendance. Secretary Bill Gardner, the nation's longest-serving chief state elections official, will host the Commission in New Hampshire. The Commission chose New Hampshire as the location for its first meeting outside of Washington, D.C., due to the state's pivotal role in the presidential selection process. More information about the meeting will be released soon on the Commission's webpage.
