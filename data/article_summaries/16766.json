The statement from Katherine Abraham, a member of the Council of Economic Advisors, addresses the employment situation in August. The report shows that private sector payrolls increased by 17,000, while overall payroll employment remained flat. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 9.1 percent, which is considered unacceptably high. The statement emphasizes the need for faster economic growth to replace jobs lost during the downturn. It also calls on Congress to pass a clean extension of the transportation bill to keep workers employed and critical infrastructure projects moving forward. The report highlights sectors with employment increases in August, such as health care and social assistance, and professional and business services. Sectors with employment declines included information, construction, and manufacturing. The statement concludes by noting that monthly employment numbers are volatile and subject to revision, so it is important not to read too much into any one report.
