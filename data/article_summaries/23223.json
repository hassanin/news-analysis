President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New Mexico due to severe storms and flooding that occurred between September 15-26, 2014. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Nancy M. Casper has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
