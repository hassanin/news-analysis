Reverend Willie T. Barrow, a Civil Rights icon and a Chicago institution, has passed away. She was known as a "Little Warrior" in the pursuit of justice for all. Reverend Barrow fought for equality from a young age and joined the cause for civil rights. She marched with Dr. King in Washington and Selma, and advocated for labor rights and women's rights. She also made one of the first pieces of the AIDS Memorial Quilt and welcomed LGBT individuals into the movement. Reverend Barrow had a significant impact in Chicago, working through organizations like Operation Breadbasket and the Rainbow/PUSH coalition. She was an inspiration, mentor, and friend to many, including the President and First Lady. While her passing is a loss, her contributions have made the world a better place. Thoughts and prayers go out to Reverend Barrow's family and loved ones.
