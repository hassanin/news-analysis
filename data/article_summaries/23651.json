President Barack Obama has declared March 20-26, 2011 as "National Poison Prevention Week" in the United States. The proclamation aims to raise awareness about the dangers of accidental poisonings and encourages Americans to take preventive measures to protect their families. Each day, nearly 2,000 Americans are treated in emergency rooms for accidental poisonings, with dozens of deaths resulting from exposure to poisonous substances. Children are particularly susceptible, with more than half of reported poison exposures involving children under the age of six. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of securing medications and other dangerous materials, reading labels before taking medications, and safely disposing of unused prescription medication. In the event of an accidental poisoning, individuals are urged to call the national poison control hotline at 1-800-222-1222 for immediate assistance.
