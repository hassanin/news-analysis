President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Utah and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts from a severe storm and flooding that occurred on September 11, 2012. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for funding. Gary R. Stanley has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
