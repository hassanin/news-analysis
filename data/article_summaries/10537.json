The United States expresses strong support for the Economic Community of West African States' (ECOWAS) decision to impose an arms embargo on Guinea and establish targeted sanctions against individuals in response to the growing crisis in the region. The US condemns the brutal violence that occurred in Guinea on September 28 and calls for cooperation with the United Nations Commission of Inquiry investigating the incident. The US will continue to work with international partners and ECOWAS to encourage the junta in Conakry to step aside and allow for the establishment of a transitional authority leading to credible elections. The US also welcomes ECOWAS' initial sanctions on Niger but urges them to impose full sanctions due to President Tandja's non-compliance with ECOWAS' request to suspend legislative elections. The US is deeply concerned about President Tandja's disregard for Niger's democratic institutions and calls for a resolution to the political crisis through dialogue rather than self-serving actions. The US looks forward to collaborating with ECOWAS on democracy and the rule of law and supports their rejection of unconstitutional acquisition or maintenance of power.
