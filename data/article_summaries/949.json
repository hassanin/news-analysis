On World Suicide Prevention Day, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. acknowledges the devastating impact of suicide and the need for effective prevention. Suicide accounts for 1 in 100 deaths globally and is the second leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 10 and 34. Certain groups, such as American Indians, Alaska Native youth, LGBTQI+ youth, and rural men, are disproportionately affected. The President emphasizes the importance of addressing mental health challenges and providing access to necessary resources. His Administration has released a comprehensive strategy to address mental health, with a proposed investment of over $22.8 billion in Fiscal Year 2023. Efforts include expanding the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to the 3-digit dialing code, 9-8-8, and implementing red-flag laws to prevent those at risk from accessing firearms. The President also highlights the support for suicide prevention programs for military personnel, veterans, and LGBTQI+ youth. He calls on individuals, communities, organizations, and all levels of government to take action in preventing suicide and making mental health care accessible and affordable.
