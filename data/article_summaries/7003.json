Russian President Vladimir Putin has recognized two regions of Ukraine as independent states and extended that recognition to include the entire Donbas region. The Russian Parliament has also authorized the deployment of more Russian forces into Ukraine. In response, the United States and its allies are imposing significant sanctions on Russia, going beyond measures taken in 2014. These actions are being coordinated with the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia. Additionally, the Biden administration has worked with Germany to halt the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. These measures are the first response to Russia's actions, and President Biden has warned that Russia will face even greater consequences if it continues its aggression.
