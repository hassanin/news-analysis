The article is a statement by NSC Spokesperson Caitlin Hayden on the response to Uganda's enactment of the Anti-Homosexuality Act. The statement highlights that the Act goes against universal human rights and complicates the bilateral relationship between Uganda and the United States. The US government has taken several steps in response, including preventing certain Ugandan officials involved in human rights abuses from entering the United States. The US will also prevent entry of Ugandans responsible for significant public corruption. Additionally, funds for certain programs involving the Ugandan Police Force, Ministry of Health, and National Public Health Institute will be discontinued or redirected, and a planned military-sponsored aviation exercise in Uganda will be cancelled. Despite these measures, the US remains committed to providing development and humanitarian support for the Ugandan people and partnering with the government to improve security in Africa. The US will continue to oppose discriminatory practices and advocate for human rights globally.
