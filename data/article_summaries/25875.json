The United States has designated Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern for severe violations of religious freedom. President Donald J. Trump expressed concern about religion-based violence in Nigeria, particularly the killing and persecution of Christians, during a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in 2018. Since then, millions of Nigerians have lived in fear for their lives, and thousands have been brutally murdered because of their faith. President Trump has emphasized the importance of defending and advancing the right to worship freely and live according to one's faith. Governments that allow religious persecution to occur pose a national security threat. The designation highlights the Nigerian government's lack of action to address faith-based violence.
