On April 12, 2010, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the security situation and violence in Somalia, including acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea and violations of the UN arms embargo. In 2012, additional steps were taken to address the export of charcoal, misappropriation of Somali public assets, and violence against civilians. The national emergency declared in 2010 and the measures adopted in 2012 are set to continue beyond April 12, 2023, as the situation in Somalia still poses a threat to US national security and foreign policy. This notice has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
