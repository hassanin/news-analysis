During a visit to the Institut Pasteur in Paris, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about the importance of collaboration between France and the United States, particularly in the field of scientific research. She highlighted the history of successful collaborations between French and American scientists in making significant discoveries in various areas such as rabies, HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, mRNA, vaccines, and pandemics.

Harris emphasized the collaborative nature of scientific work, where researchers from around the world come together to improve human life and conditions. She praised scientists for their ability to see what is possible and their commitment to innovation and creativity. Harris also noted the importance of perseverance and the willingness to try different approaches in scientific experiments.

Drawing a comparison to politics and government, Harris suggested that politicians could learn from the scientific approach of starting with a hypothesis, testing it out, analyzing mistakes, and updating their plans accordingly. She expressed her belief that adopting a more scientific mindset in public policy and government could lead to more effective and productive work.

When asked about the current process of the Build Back Better initiative, Harris clarified that her statements were not specific to that situation but rather a general observation she has been making for years. She emphasized the need to encourage innovation and the understanding that the process of improvement may involve glitches and mistakes along the way. However, as long as progress is made and mistakes are not repeated, it should be embraced and supported.
