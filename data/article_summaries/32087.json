President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed November 2018 as National Native American Heritage Month. In his proclamation, he recognizes the contributions of Native Americans to American society and emphasizes the commitment to preserving and protecting Native American cultures, languages, and history. He acknowledges the important roles that Native Americans play in various sectors, such as business, education, and public service, including their significant representation in the Armed Forces. The administration is focused on supporting the sovereignty of Indian nations and working with tribal leaders to address challenges like generational poverty. Efforts are also being made to improve the quality of services delivered to Native American communities, combat the opioid epidemic, fight human trafficking and violent crime, expand educational opportunities, enhance border security, and improve infrastructure. Earlier this year, legislation granting federal recognition to six American Indian tribes was signed into law. The President encourages all Americans to learn more about Native American cultures and celebrates November 23, 2018, as Native American Heritage Day.
