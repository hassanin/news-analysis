The White House announced that NOAA has released a floor risk mapping tool that allows communities to visualize the impacts of different flood scenarios on their populations and infrastructure. The tool was originally developed for New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, but has now been expanded to cover coastal areas along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, and NOAA have also announced collaborations on four landscape partnerships in southwest Florida, Hawaii, Washington, and the Great Lakes region. These partnerships will work to prepare for and prevent climate-related threats such as sea level rise, drought, wildfire, and invasive species. The article also mentioned that the U.S. has sent an aircraft carrier to the Gulf of Aden to protect the freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce in the region. The U.S. has concerns about Iran's support for the Houthis in Yemen, and the aircraft carrier is part of the U.S.'s efforts to address these concerns. Finally, the article mentioned that the President is expected to make a statement about these matters at an event in the Everglades the following day.
