The President issued a statement on the death of Taliban leader Akhtar Mohammad Mansur, highlighting it as an important milestone in the effort to bring peace and prosperity to Afghanistan. Mansur was the leader of an organization that plotted against and attacked American and Coalition forces, waged war against the Afghan people, and aligned itself with extremist groups like al Qa'ida. The President emphasized that Mansur rejected peace talks and the opportunity for the Taliban to join the Afghan government in a reconciliation process. The United States will continue to support Afghanistan in strengthening its security forces and pursuing peace and progress. The President expressed gratitude to the military and intelligence personnel who work to protect American people and partners and thanked all Americans who have served in Afghanistan.
