President Obama met with Caribbean leaders in a U.S.-CARICOM Summit to discuss various issues, including trade, investment, security cooperation, and energy. The leaders focused on improving energy security, reducing energy costs, and fighting climate change. The United States is launching initiatives such as the Clean Energy Finance Facility for the Caribbean and Central America, a task force to evaluate progress in energy cooperation, clean energy financing, technology collaboration, transition to a clean energy economy, greening tourism, and a clean energy program in Jamaica. These initiatives aim to encourage investment in clean energy projects, advance energy sector reform, promote regional integration, and support sustainable energy development.
