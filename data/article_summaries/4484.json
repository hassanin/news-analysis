President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894 regarding the situation in and in relation to Syria will continue beyond October 14, 2023. This decision is based on the actions of the Government of Turkey conducting a military offensive into northeast Syria, which undermines the campaign against ISIS, endangers civilians, threatens regional peace, security, and stability, and poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
