First Lady Melania Trump joined her husband, President Trump, in Paris, France to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Armistice that ended World War I. They were greeted by various officials upon arrival. Due to bad weather, they were unable to visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial. They attended a dinner hosted by President Macron and Mrs. Macron at the Musée d’Orsay, and also attended France’s “Centennial of the 1918 Armistice Day” ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe. The First Lady participated in a spousal luncheon at the Palace of Versailles and expressed gratitude for the commemoration of the end of World War I.
