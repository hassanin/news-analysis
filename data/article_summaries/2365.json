Ambassador Roberta Jacobson has been a valuable asset to the Biden-Harris administration and the United States as the Special Assistant to the President and Coordinator for the Southwest Border at the National Security Council. She has dedicated her career to advancing U.S. interests in the Western Hemisphere, including serving as the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico. President Biden recognized her expertise and appointed her to lead a more safe, secure, and just approach to the Southern Border. As part of her commitment to serving in the administration's first 100 days, Ambassador Jacobson will retire from her role at the end of this month. During her tenure, she has shaped the relationship with Mexico as an equal partner, launched efforts with the Northern Triangle nations, and emphasized the administration's commitment to revitalizing the U.S. immigration system. President Biden has entrusted Vice President Kamala Harris with leading the administration's work on efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle, highlighting the administration's focus on improving conditions in the region. This whole-of-government approach is supported by Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, who were tasked by the President to rebuild the immigration system.
