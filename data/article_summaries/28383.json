On November 22, 2015, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the situation in Burundi, which was characterized by violence against civilians, political repression, and threats to peace and stability in the region. While acknowledging the recent peaceful transfer of power in Burundi, President Trump has stated that he has not seen enough evidence to suggest that the situation has been resolved. As a result, he has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, citing the continued threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
