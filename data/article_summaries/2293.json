On Women's Equality Day, President Joe Biden issued a proclamation honoring the movement for universal suffrage and renewing the commitment to advancing gender equity and protecting women's rights. The proclamation emphasized the importance of reproductive rights, especially in light of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The administration is dedicated to protecting access to reproductive healthcare and defending the Equal Rights Amendment. The proclamation also highlighted the ongoing struggle to ensure every American can vote, particularly addressing the impact of voting restrictions on marginalized communities. The administration is committed to building on the progress made by women and girls in fighting for social justice and freedom. This includes protecting access to critical reproductive healthcare, combating gender-based violence, promoting fair treatment in the workplace, and advocating for economic security and pay equity. President Biden called on the American people to celebrate and continue working towards gender equality and to defend and strengthen the right to vote.
