The United States and Ukraine released a joint statement at the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague, reaffirming their strategic partnership and the importance of nuclear nonproliferation. The United States commended Ukraine for its decision in 1994 to remove all nuclear weapons from its territory and join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The United States condemned Russia's unilateral military actions in Ukraine, which violate the Budapest Memorandum that Russia, the US, and the UK had signed to respect Ukraine's independence and existing borders. The US and Ukraine both refuse to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and will continue to support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US also acknowledged Ukraine's leadership in nuclear security and nonproliferation, highlighting the 2012 removal of all highly enriched uranium from Ukraine. The US committed to providing technical support for Ukraine's newly completed Neutron Source Facility and to continue partnering with Ukraine on preventing nuclear proliferation.
