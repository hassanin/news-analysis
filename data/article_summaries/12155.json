President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Iowa and authorized federal aid to assist in the recovery efforts from severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from June 3-4, 2014. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Adams, Clarke, Decatur, Mills, Montgomery, Pottawattamie, Ringgold, Taylor, and Wayne. Additionally, federal funding is available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Michael L. Parker has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and further designations may be made if necessary based on damage assessments.
