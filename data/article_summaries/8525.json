Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at Meridian High School in Falls Church, Virginia, addressing the importance of investing in electric school buses. She announced $500 million in clean bus funding that will be available for school districts across the country to purchase clean buses and build charging infrastructure. This funding is part of a larger $5 billion investment in clean school buses over the next five years through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Harris emphasized the health and environmental benefits of electric buses, highlighting how diesel exhaust from traditional school buses can harm children's health and contribute to climate change. She also mentioned the job creation potential in the electric bus industry. Harris urged for a future where every school bus in the nation is zero-emission.
