President Obama expressed his joy at the release of Sarah Shourd, who had been held in Iran, and praised the efforts of the Swiss, the Sultanate of Oman, and other allies in securing her release. However, he emphasized that Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, who were still being held in Iran, were innocent and called on Iran to show compassion by releasing them and other detained Americans. The President commended the strength and courage of the Shourd, Bauer, and Fattal families and vowed to continue working towards the release of their loved ones.
