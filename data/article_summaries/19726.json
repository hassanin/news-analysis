President Obama and Vice President Biden will hold a White House Recovery and Reinvestment Act Implementation Conference on March 12th. The purpose of the conference is to ensure that the funds invested and spent as part of the Recovery Act are effective, transparent, and efficient. Each state's Governor is being invited to send their senior official working on Recovery Act implementation to learn about available programs and initiatives. State officials will have the opportunity to share ideas and best practices, as well as hear presentations from Cabinet Secretaries and Administration officials. The goal of the conference is to streamline the implementation process and get the economy running again. More details about the conference will be released at a later date.
