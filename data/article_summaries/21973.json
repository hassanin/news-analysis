The United States strongly condemns the military coup in Guinea Bissau and calls for the immediate restoration of the legitimate government. The safety of the interim president and other government leaders is a major concern, and the release of all government leaders is urged. The US supports the efforts of ECOWAS and the United Nations Security Council in denouncing the unconstitutional seizure of power and reinforcing constitutional rule.
