This article is about an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in 2014 to streamline the export/import process for American businesses. The order aims to reduce supply chain barriers to commerce while still protecting national security, public health and safety, the environment, and natural resources. The United States, being the largest economy and trading nation in the world, recognizes the importance of trade in fueling economic growth and supporting jobs. The order emphasizes the need to improve technologies, policies, and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders. It also calls for the development of an International Trade Data System (ITDS) to modernize and simplify interactions between government agencies and traders. The ITDS will serve as a single window for businesses to transmit data required by participating agencies for importation or exportation of cargo. The order establishes the Border Interagency Executive Council (BIEC), an interagency working group chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security, to enhance coordination across customs, transport security, health and safety, trade, and other relevant agencies with border management responsibilities. The BIEC will develop policies and processes to improve supply chain processes and identify illicit shipments. It will also develop risk management principles and methods to inform agency operations associated with the review and release of cargo at the border. The order encourages agencies to use international standards for product classification and identification and to explore opportunities for electronic payment of duties, taxes, fees, and charges due at importation. Agencies are required to review and modify regulations as necessary to support the development of the ITDS. The order also calls for regular reports on the implementation of its provisions.
