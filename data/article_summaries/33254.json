President Trump is visiting a U.S. Customs and Border Protection hangar facility in Yuma, Arizona to emphasize his border security strategy. The strategy includes the construction of a border wall, increasing the number of agents, and implementing technology and access roads to effectively patrol the border. The visit to Yuma is significant because the strategy has been successful in reducing apprehensions in the area. Acting ICE Director Tom Homan supports the President's strategy and emphasizes the importance of interior enforcement as well. Homan believes that a strong border and interior enforcement are necessary for effective immigration enforcement. The President is seeking funding to make the border security measures permanent and to build the wall. The investments made during the Bush administration have contributed to the success of the strategy. The FY18 budget request includes funding for the border wall, technology, additional Border Patrol and ICE agents, and surveillance equipment. The focus on interior enforcement is a clear message to undocumented immigrants that there is no safe haven in the United States. There is no discussion or action regarding a pardon for Joe Arpaio at this time. The President will be delivering a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight and has consistently condemned hate in all forms. He appreciates the opportunity to speak directly to the American people and will continue to do so. The technology being used at the hangar facility is not new since the Trump administration took office, but the President is investing in and sustaining the technology to improve border security capabilities.
