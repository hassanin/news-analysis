In this statement, the President praises Gap, Inc. for announcing their decision to raise wages for their employees, benefiting about 65,000 workers in the U.S. The President emphasizes the importance of businesses raising their employees' wages and states that he has required federal contractors to pay a minimum wage of $10.10 an hour. He also mentions that more states are taking steps to raise their minimum wage. However, the President highlights that only action from Congress can make a nationwide difference. He urges Congress to pass a bill that would increase America's minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and lift wages for over 16 million workers, without requiring new taxes or spending.
