First Lady Michelle Obama will be welcoming the Official White House Christmas Tree to the White House on November 28. The tree, an 18.5-foot Douglas Fir, was grown by Chris Botek from Crystal Spring Tree Farm in Lehighton, PA. On December 3, Mrs. Obama will welcome military families to the White House for the first viewing of the 2014 holiday decorations. The decorations will include holiday crafts and treats, and will honor military families.
