Congress has passed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2018, which is a 5-year reauthorization of FAA programs. The Act invests in airport infrastructure, promotes safety and American leadership in aviation, and strengthens consumer service. Additionally, the Act includes the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act of 2018, which reforms the United States' development finance institutions. The BUILD Act aims to incentivize private sector investment in emerging economies and provide alternatives to state-directed initiatives. It codifies the proposal in President Trump's Fiscal Year 2019 Budget Request to create a consolidated, reformed Development Finance Institution with strong linkages to the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development. The legislation aligns development finance with broader foreign policy and development goals, minimizes risk to taxpayers, catalyzes private-sector resources, and increases efficiency in development finance programs.
