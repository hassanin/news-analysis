The U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security met in Washington on April 28 to discuss the implementation of the Joint Statement by Presidents Biden and von der Leyen. The meeting focused on diversifying natural gas supplies to Europe and reducing Europe's demand for natural gas. The Task Force reviewed progress on this issue, including the EU Energy Purchase Platform and plans to accelerate the diversification of gas supply through additional LNG supplies. The discussion also included options to reduce Europe's demand for natural gas, such as the deployment of heat pumps, energy-efficient technologies, and renewable energy. Work will continue at technical and senior officials' levels, with the Task Force planning to reconvene in June to assess progress.
