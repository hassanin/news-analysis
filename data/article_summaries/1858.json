National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan recently met with African Union Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat to emphasize President Biden's commitment to Africa. They discussed collaborating through multilateral institutions like the African Union and the United Nations to address global challenges. Sullivan reiterated the United States' dedication to working with Africa on various goals, including combating the COVID-19 pandemic, advancing global health security, building an inclusive global economy, addressing the climate crisis, and promoting democracy and human rights. Sullivan also welcomed a strong statement from Chairperson Faki and African Union chair President of Senegal Macky Sall, which called on Russia to respect international law and Ukraine's national sovereignty. Additionally, Sullivan highlighted areas where the United States and the African Union have mutual interests, such as restoring democracy in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea, supporting fragile transitions in Sudan and Chad, and working towards peaceful and stable futures for Ethiopia and Somalia. Both parties agreed to maintain close coordination as President Biden plans to convene African leaders for a U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit and host the Global COVID-19 Summit this year.
