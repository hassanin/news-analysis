The United States is deeply concerned about the escalating violence and dire humanitarian conditions in Yemen. They are calling on all parties involved to immediately stop hostilities, restart political talks, and alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people. The US condemns the Houthis for their brutal repression of political opponents, including the killing of former ally Ali Abdullah Salih and his family, as well as their missile attacks on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. They also accuse the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of arming and supporting the Houthis, which further intensifies the violence and hampers humanitarian aid efforts. The US is urging the Saudi-led coalition to allow the free flow of humanitarian aid and commercial goods through all Yemeni ports, as well as the resumption of commercial flights through Sana'a Airport. They also call on the Houthis to distribute food, medicine, and fuel to the areas they control instead of diverting them for military purposes. The US believes that the conflict in Yemen must be resolved through political negotiations in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions to ensure Yemen's prosperity and freedom from Iranian-backed militias.
