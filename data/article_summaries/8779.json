Vice President Kamala Harris visited IBEW Local 103 in Boston, Massachusetts to discuss women's reproductive rights. She thanked Governor Charlie Baker and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley for their leadership on the issue. Harris emphasized the importance of freedom, liberty, and dignity in decision-making and expressed her belief that women should have the right to make decisions about their own bodies without government interference. She also highlighted the healthcare crisis in America and criticized states that pass laws without exceptions for rape or incest. Harris, a former prosecutor specializing in child sexual assault cases, argued that survivors should not be subject to government control and should have the autonomy to make decisions based on their best interests. She connected the issue of reproductive rights to attacks on democracy and other rights, such as voting and LGBTQ rights. Harris praised the leaders in Kansas who recently advocated for women's rights, emphasizing that the majority of Americans agree with the principle of women making their own decisions. The Biden administration has signed executive orders to address the issue and is committed to protecting women's rights.
