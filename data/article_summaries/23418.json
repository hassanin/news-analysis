In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest criticized Congress for passing a bill that he described as a "meager accomplishment" in response to the Zika virus. He argued that the bill does not provide sufficient funding to address the issue and does not include important measures to protect pregnant women and newborn children. Earnest also discussed the recent incident in which Russian planes flew dangerously close to a US Navy destroyer in the Baltic Sea, saying that the behavior is inconsistent with professional norms. He stated that the White House will express concerns to Russia through private communication channels. Earnest also mentioned that President Obama met with his national security team to discuss the ongoing effort to degrade and destroy ISIS. He emphasized the importance of intelligence-sharing and the need to continue pressuring ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. Earnest did not provide any updates on the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, but expressed optimism that more Republican senators would meet with Garland and eventually hold a confirmation hearing. He also stated that the President is considering options to address campaign finance issues, but did not provide specific details.
