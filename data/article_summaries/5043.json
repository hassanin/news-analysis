The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the already increasing demand for mental health and substance use services among young people in the United States. Data shows alarming rates of behavioral health needs among school-age youth, with significant increases in anxiety, depression, and suicide. However, many young people, especially those from marginalized communities, still lack access to affordable healthcare coverage and face barriers in accessing behavioral health services. The Biden-Harris Administration is prioritizing the expansion of prevention, treatment, and recovery services for young people and their families. They are working to ensure access to quality and affordable healthcare coverage, strengthening the quality of care provided to children, and investing in community-based youth mental health and substance use care. Additionally, they are enhancing access to youth behavioral health services, increasing school-based behavioral health supports, and laying the groundwork for future improvements in youth mental health and substance use prevention and treatment. The administration is also highlighting the pandemic's impact on youth mental health and promoting recommendations to support young people's mental health. The FY 2022 budget calls for more than doubling the funding to address mental health and substance use, with a focus on supporting youth with behavioral health needs and their families. The administration's goal is to improve youth mental health, expand access to affordable and quality services, and eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health.
