The Senate has confirmed Amy Coney Barrett as the 115th Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court. Barrett has a strong record of upholding the U.S. Constitution and has received the highest rating from the American Bar Association. She has stated that she will not legislate from the bench and believes that policy decisions should be made by the political branches of government. Barrett's former law clerks describe her as principled and independent-minded. Colleagues at Notre Dame Law School view her as a sympathetic yet impartial judge. Barrett believes in protecting institutions, freedoms, and the rule of law for future generations.
