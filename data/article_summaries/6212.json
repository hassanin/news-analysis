In recognition of National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, President Joe Biden has called for efforts to reduce drunk and drug-impaired driving and ensure the safety of American roadways. Every year, over 10,000 lives are lost to impaired driving, accounting for nearly a third of all traffic deaths. The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to an increase in impaired driving incidents. The President emphasizes the need to raise awareness, support individuals struggling with substance use, and invest in technologies to prevent crashes. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides funds for states to develop technologies that can detect and prevent impaired driving. Additionally, new passenger motor vehicles are required to be equipped with crash-averting features. The Department of Transportation is collaborating with agencies and non-profits to educate the public through media campaigns. The Biden administration has secured billions of dollars to expand access to substance use services and fight the opioid epidemic. They are also working to reduce the supply of illicit substances and end the stigma around addiction. The President encourages Americans to plan ahead for safe transportation after drinking and to never drive under the influence. Ride-share apps can help ensure safe travel. The proclamation designates December 2022 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month and urges all Americans to make responsible decisions and take measures to prevent impaired driving.
