The article is a letter from John Brennan, Presidential Advisor on Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, and James Jones, General National Security Advisor, to Senator Levin regarding additional support for strategic and integrated security on the southwest border. The letter discusses the administration's efforts to enhance federal protection of the border, law enforcement measures, and drug enforcement efforts. It highlights the record number of Customs and Border Protection officers, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and National Guard members currently working on the border. The letter also mentions the increased funding and cooperation with Mexico to dismantle transnational criminal organizations. The administration emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive and multi-level security strategy, rather than mobilizing an arbitrary number of National Guard members. It also asserts that directing the use of the Armed Forces is the responsibility of the Commander in Chief and interfering with this role would undermine the President's administration of the Total Force. The letter concludes by stating that while more needs to be done, efforts along the southwest border have already yielded positive results, such as increased drug seizures and decreased illegal immigration. The administration believes that a more strategic and integrated approach will continue to enhance border security and safety in border communities.
