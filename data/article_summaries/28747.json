President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have announced the initial details for the 139th White House Easter Egg Roll. The event will take place on Monday, April 17, 2017, on the South Lawn of the White House. Families with children 13 years old and younger are invited to join the President, First Lady, White House staff, and their families for a day of festivities. The White House Easter Egg Roll is a long-standing tradition, dating back to 1878. The President and First Lady are committed to continuing this tradition while also introducing new ones. Tickets for the event are free and will be allocated through an online lottery. More information, including the timing of the lottery, will be released later this month.
