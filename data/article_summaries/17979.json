The President of the United States congratulates the people of Ukraine on their successful parliamentary elections. Despite challenges in some regions, millions of Ukrainians were able to vote in an orderly and peaceful manner. The government of Ukraine is commended for the conduct of the campaign and election day, which international monitoring organizations deemed largely in line with international standards. However, Russian authorities in Crimea and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine prevented many Ukrainian citizens from voting. The President calls on Russia to ensure that voters in Donetsk and Luhansk can participate in local elections on December 7, as agreed upon in the Minsk agreement. The United States will not recognize any election held in separatist-held areas that does not comply with Ukrainian law and the authority of the Ukrainian government. The parliamentary vote represents an important milestone in Ukraine's democratic development, and the United States is ready to support the choices of the Ukrainian people and the new government in enacting reforms and promoting further democratic development, rule of law, and economic stability. The United States will also continue to support Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and peaceful resolution of the conflict in the east and the return of Crimea.
