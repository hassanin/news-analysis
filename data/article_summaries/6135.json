The Vice President, Kamala Harris, delivered a speech at the Atlantic City Convention Center in New Jersey. She emphasized the importance of women being able to make decisions about their reproductive health without government interference. She criticized the recent Dobbs decision by the Supreme Court, which she sees as a threat to women's rights and a national healthcare crisis. Harris highlighted the efforts of the Biden administration to protect women's access to abortion and called on Congress to codify Roe v. Wade into law. She also urged people to pay attention to upcoming elections, as local and state leaders play a significant role in implementing laws regarding reproductive rights. Harris praised New Jersey for its work in protecting women's reproductive rights and expanding voting rights. She warned that the Dobbs decision is just the beginning of an agenda that could also target other rights, such as access to contraception and same-sex marriage. Harris called on Americans to stand up and fight for the protection of constitutional rights for all.
