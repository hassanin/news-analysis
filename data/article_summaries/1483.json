The leaders of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States have announced the creation of an enhanced trilateral security partnership called AUKUS. The aim of this partnership is to deepen diplomatic, security, and defense cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. The first initiative under AUKUS is to support Australia in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines for its navy. The three nations will work together over the next 18 months to develop an optimal pathway for this capability. The partnership will also focus on enhancing joint capabilities and interoperability in areas such as cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and undersea capabilities. The goal of this endeavor is to sustain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and uphold shared values.
