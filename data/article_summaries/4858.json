This memorandum, issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., promotes accountability for conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) and outlines the United States' policy and approach to prevent and respond to CRSV worldwide. The memorandum emphasizes the devastating effects of CRSV on individuals and communities, and highlights the need to address impunity and provide support to survivors. It states that the United States does not accept CRSV as an inevitable cost of armed conflict and is committed to using all available tools, including legal, policy, diplomatic, and financial measures, to deter such violence and break the cycle of impunity. The memorandum directs relevant agencies to fully exercise existing authorities to impose economic sanctions and implement visa restrictions to promote justice and accountability for acts of CRSV. It also calls for the strengthening of other existing tools and authorities, including the provision of security assistance, to address CRSV. Additionally, the memorandum emphasizes the importance of building coalitions with like-minded nations and engaging international organizations to promote accountability for acts of CRSV. The memorandum provides a definition of CRSV and clarifies that it can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity, or acts of genocide punishable under international law.
