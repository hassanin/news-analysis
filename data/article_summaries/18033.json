The article provides background information on the post-9/11 GI Bill, which is a Department of Veterans Affairs Education benefit for individuals who served on active duty after September 10, 2001. The bill aims to provide comprehensive education benefits to honor the sacrifices made by military personnel. The eligibility criteria for the benefits include serving for at least 90 days after September 10, 2001, or serving at least 30 continuous days on active duty after that date and receiving a discharge for disability. Benefit payment rates vary based on the length of service and discharge status. Instead of one monthly payment, there are three different payments made under the bill: tuition and fees paid directly to the school, a monthly housing allowance paid to the individual, and a books and supplies stipend paid to the individual. The bill also allows for the transfer of entitlement to dependents under certain conditions. Additionally, schools may enter into an agreement with the VA to pay charges not covered by the bill through the Yellow Ribbon Program. The article also mentions some education priorities of the Obama administration, including the Race to the Top Fund, community college funding, and early childhood education. The event mentioned in the article includes the participation of various government officials and military personnel.
