This article is a transcript of an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in 2013. The order is titled "Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change" and outlines the need for actions to enhance climate preparedness and resilience in the nation. It acknowledges the current impacts of climate change, including high temperatures, heavy downpours, wildfires, droughts, permafrost thawing, ocean acidification, and sea-level rise. The order emphasizes the importance of cooperation and planning between the federal government, stakeholders, and various sectors to improve climate preparedness and resilience. It calls for the modernization of federal programs to support climate-resilient investments, managing lands and waters for climate preparedness and resilience, providing information and tools for climate change preparedness, and federal agency planning for climate change-related risks. The order also establishes the Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience, as well as the State, Local, and Tribal Leaders Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience. The task force is tasked with providing recommendations to the President and the Council on how the federal government can support state, local, and tribal preparedness for climate change. The executive order terminates the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force and defines key terms such as "preparedness," "adaptation," and "resilience."
