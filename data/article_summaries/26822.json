The Philadelphia Eagles will not be attending the White House celebration with their full team. They disagree with President Trump's insistence that they stand for the National Anthem to honor the military and the country. The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event will still be invited to a different ceremony that will honor the country and its heroes. President Trump will be present with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus to celebrate America.
