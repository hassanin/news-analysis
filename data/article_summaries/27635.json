This article is a proclamation issued by President Donald Trump on May 31, 2018, regarding the adjustment of imports of aluminum articles into the United States. The proclamation discusses the Secretary of Commerce's report on the effect of aluminum imports on national security and the decision to impose a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles imported from most countries. It also mentions ongoing discussions with certain countries on alternative means to address the threat to national security posed by aluminum imports. The proclamation states that the United States has reached agreements with Argentina and Australia on measures to reduce excess aluminum production, prevent transshipment, and avoid import surges. As a result, the tariff on aluminum articles imported from these countries will no longer apply. The proclamation also mentions the need to maintain the current tariff level on aluminum articles imported from other countries. The proclamation further amends certain provisions related to the tariff and instructs the Secretary of Commerce to revise the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States accordingly. Any inconsistent provisions from previous proclamations and executive orders are superseded.
