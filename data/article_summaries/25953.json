President Donald Trump has signed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps Amendments Act of 2020 into law. The Act makes changes to the governance of the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps. However, President Trump notes that section 207 of the Act authorizes NOAA officers to communicate directly with Congress without supervision from the executive branch and without consequence for unauthorized disclosures of classified or confidential information. President Trump asserts that this provision cannot undermine his constitutional authority to supervise and control NOAA officers' communications with Congress, particularly when sensitive information protected by executive privilege is involved. He expects that supervising officials will promptly contact the appropriate congressional committees to initiate the accommodation process if they determine that the disclosure of sensitive information by a NOAA officer needs to be deferred, limited, or prevented.
