President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of South Dakota and has ordered federal assistance to aid in the recovery efforts after severe storms and flooding occurred from May 26 to June 7, 2019. The federal funding will be available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, to cover the cost of emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The funding will also be available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. James R. Stephenson has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Further designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and deemed necessary based on damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
