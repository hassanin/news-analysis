This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on July 24, 2020, aims to address the high prices of pharmaceutical drugs in the United States. It highlights how the complex nature of the drug-purchasing process often results in patients paying more than they should, while middlemen, such as health plan sponsors and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), collect significant discounts. These discounts, known as rebates, are seen as kickbacks and prevent Medicare patients from benefiting from the savings. The order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to narrow the safe harbor for these discounts and establish new safe harbors that would allow discounts to be passed on to patients at the point-of-sale. The goal is to save Medicare patients billions of dollars and lower their out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. The order also emphasizes the need to protect low premiums and ensure that the actions taken do not increase federal spending or patient costs.
