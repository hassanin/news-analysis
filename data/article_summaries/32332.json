Second Lady Karen Pence, along with members of The Congressional Club, participated in a service project at the Vice President's Residence. They assembled 800 art supply kits to be donated to 28 children's hospitals across the United States. The art kits were made on behalf of Emma's Art Cart, a nonprofit organization started by Emma Stumpf of Indiana. Emma, who was seven years old when doctors discovered a brain tumor, found comfort by working with art therapists during her treatment. She started collecting art supplies to donate to young patients and formed her own program called Emma's Art Cart. Emma's goal is to have 150,000 kits donated to children's hospitals by the end of the year. Mrs. Pence commended Emma for her dedication and expressed her pleasure in helping this worthwhile cause. Second Lady Karen Pence has chosen art therapy as her initiative and calls it "Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART." Art therapy is an integrative mental health and human services profession that enriches the lives of individuals, families, and communities through active art-making. Professional art therapists facilitate art therapy using various psychological and counseling theories and techniques.
