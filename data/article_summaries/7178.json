Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, thanking Secretary Gina Raimondo and Secretary Deb Haaland for their leadership in the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior, respectively. She emphasized the importance of the nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous communities and acknowledged their contributions to shaping the nation. Harris discussed the disparities that persist in Tribal communities, such as pay gaps, education gaps, healthcare disparities, voting barriers, and lack of high-speed internet access. She highlighted the need for high-speed internet in Tribal communities and the challenges they face in ensuring access. Harris announced that nearly $1 billion in funds for Tribal broadband infrastructure programs are now available for use. These funds can be used for laying fiber-optic cables, digital-literacy programs, apprenticeships, and job training. She stressed that this funding is a down payment on the work that needs to be done and that the goal is to connect every American household. Harris mentioned the American Jobs Plan, which aims to create good jobs, build broadband infrastructure, increase competition, and reduce costs to ensure high-speed internet access for all Americans. She called on Congress to work together to bring high-speed internet to every American. Harris shared the story of Chairperson Aaron Payment, who highlighted the importance of internet access for accessing healthcare, particularly for those battling opioid addiction. She concluded by emphasizing that high-speed internet is a lifeline and that there is still work to be done to ensure connectivity for all.
