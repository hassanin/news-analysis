The White House released a statement by Robert Gibbs on April 13, 2009, regarding the United Nations' condemnation of North Korea's missile launch. The statement emphasizes the President's appreciation for the UN Security Council's unified message condemning the launch and affirming that it violates international law. The international community is demanding that North Korea abandon its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and cease further provocations. The United States will continue collaborating with its allies in the Six-Party Talks to achieve the verifiable elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons program and reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
