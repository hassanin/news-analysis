President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 2015 as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among American men, with over 220,000 Americans expected to be diagnosed with it this year. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about prostate cancer and encouraging men to make informed decisions about their health. It also highlights the progress made in reducing prostate cancer mortality through innovative research. The Affordable Care Act is mentioned as a law that provides access to quality and affordable care for cancer patients, while also preventing insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions. The Precision Medicine Initiative is also mentioned as an effort to accelerate biomedical discoveries and improve disease treatment. The proclamation concludes with a call to honor those who have lost their lives to prostate cancer and a commitment to continue working towards a future free from cancer.
