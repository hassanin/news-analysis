President Donald J. Trump will award the Medal of Honor to Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman, United States Air Force, for his actions on March 4, 2002, on Takur Ghar mountain in Afghanistan. Chapman's aircraft came under heavy enemy fire and was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. Despite being severely wounded, Chapman charged into enemy fire, seized an enemy bunker, and engaged multiple enemy personnel before ultimately sacrificing his life. His actions are credited with saving the lives of his teammates. Chapman's spouse and family will join the President at the White House for the ceremony. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of their own lives above and beyond the call of duty. Press credentialing information will be released at a later date.
