This press gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz addresses several topics. Schultz discusses the anniversary of President Obama sending a proposal to Congress for an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against ISIL, highlighting Congress's failure to pass it. He also mentions the progress made in the fight against ISIL and the President's efforts to get Congress to vote on an AUMF. The press gaggle then moves on to discuss the Democratic primary and the President's views on Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton. Schultz emphasizes that the President believes there will be a clear choice between Democrats and Republicans in the general election. The press gaggle concludes with questions about the ASEAN Summit, the President's potential visit to Flint, Michigan, funding for Flint and Zika, the nomination of John King as Education Secretary, and the Internet tax bill.
