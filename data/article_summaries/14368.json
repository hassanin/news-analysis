The authors also emphasize the importance of prioritizing wellness and mental health support for veterans, particularly those dealing with post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injuries. They mention the commitment from national associations of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals to provide care and support for these conditions. Additionally, the op-ed mentions the efforts to support education for veterans, including the "8 Keys to Success" initiative that community colleges and universities have signed on to, as well as the Operation Educate the Educators program that helps teachers better understand and support military children.
