The White House Press Secretary issued a statement regarding the case of Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. The statement emphasizes that the health care law provides women and families with control over their health care by offering free preventive care, including cancer screenings and birth control. The Obama Administration has asked the Supreme Court to review a challenge to the law's requirement that for-profit corporations provide birth control coverage in their employee insurance plans. The Administration believes this requirement is lawful and essential for women's health. The statement also asserts that health care decisions should be made between a woman and her doctor, and no entity, including the government or for-profit corporations, should be able to dictate those decisions. The Administration has taken steps to protect religious institutions and accommodate non-profit organizations that object to contraception based on religious grounds. These actions aim to safeguard both women's health and religious beliefs, ensuring that personal health decisions are made by women and families, not their employers.
