The article is a letter from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, written by Barack Obama in 2015. The letter discusses the imposition of additional sanctions on North Korea. The sanctions are aimed at addressing North Korea's actions that pose a threat to the United States and others. The letter mentions previous executive orders that have been issued to deal with the threat posed by North Korea, including restrictions on North Korean entities and individuals, and the prohibition of the importation of goods, services, and technology from North Korea. The letter states that the actions and policies of the North Korean government, including cyber-related actions, violations of United Nations Security Council Resolutions, and human rights abuses, constitute a continuing threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The sanctions are not targeted at the people of North Korea but are aimed at the government and its activities. The letter leaves in place existing sanctions and provides criteria for blocking the property and interests of those determined to be associated with the North Korean government or providing support to it. The letter also mentions the suspension of entry into the United States for individuals meeting certain criteria. The authority to carry out these actions is delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State. All executive agencies are directed to take appropriate measures to implement the provisions of the order.
