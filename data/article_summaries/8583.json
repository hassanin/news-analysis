President Biden is set to meet with President Louren√ßo of Angola at the White House. This meeting marks the 30-year anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries and highlights the deepening partnership between them. The meeting will focus on reviewing the progress made in their relationship and setting a course for further cooperation. Some highlights of the partnership include major infrastructure and economic deals, collaboration on regional security challenges, and Angola's principled leadership on global issues such as Russia's war in Ukraine. The leaders will also discuss the state of democracy globally and in Africa. The meeting is expected to result in the signing of the Artemis Accords, a set of principles guiding civil space exploration and use in the 21st century, with Angola becoming the third African country to sign. The Lobito Corridor, a major infrastructure project connecting Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia to global markets, will also be a topic of discussion. The US has committed over a billion dollars in financing for the corridor, which includes investments in rail, digital connectivity, mobile money, and solar power. The US has also mobilized additional investments from other partners, such as the African Development Bank and the EU. The meeting will touch on regional issues, including the conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where Angola has been leading diplomatic efforts to deescalate tensions. The leaders will also discuss security cooperation, including military modernization and mil-to-mil exchanges. The meeting will send a message of the US administration's commitment to Africa, despite President Biden not visiting the continent this year. The administration has made significant investments and engagements with African nations and people, including 16 Cabinet-level or principal-level trips to the continent.
