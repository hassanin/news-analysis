President Biden's administration is taking new actions to prevent and reduce homelessness among veterans. These actions include launching supportive services to rehouse veterans experiencing homelessness, providing legal services for veterans at risk of homelessness, and funding programs to help veterans find jobs. The administration will invest $3.1 billion to quickly rehouse people experiencing homelessness, including veterans. These efforts build upon previous investments that have led to an 11% decrease in veteran homelessness since early 2020 and a 55% decrease since 2010. The administration aims to permanently house at least 38,000 veterans by 2023. The American Rescue Plan, released earlier this year, provided significant funding to address homelessness, and the Fiscal Year 2024 Budget proposes additional investments to prevent and address homelessness, including increasing the supply of affordable housing and establishing rental assistance guarantees for vulnerable groups.
