Karen Pence, the Second Lady, visited the IU Health Neuroscience Center in Indianapolis and learned about the partnership between the center and art therapists from Herron School of Art and Design. They are conducting research to understand how art therapy can help patients dealing with various medical and mental health issues. The goal is to better focus on specific types of art therapy for specific conditions. Through this research, science is beginning to provide evidence of how working with an art therapist can reprogram the brain, redirect neurons, and improve someone's life. Karen Pence is using her platform to shine a light on art therapy and will share stories about her visits to elevate its importance.
