President Donald Trump has signed the "Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018" into law. However, he has stated that section 6(c) of the Act, which requires the Secretary of State to consult with certain congressional committees when preparing annual reports on the activities of the Nicaraguan Government, will be treated as advisory. The President believes that mandatory consultation is not consistent with the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution. Despite this, he hopes that consultation will still be possible while preparing the reports and recognizes the benefits of working with Congress on the issues related to the Nicaraguan Government. The President emphasizes that the law must be executed in accordance with the separation of powers and his constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs.
