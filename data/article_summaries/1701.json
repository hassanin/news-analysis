The President is pleased with Congress' agreement on the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. The Administration supports holding China accountable for genocide and human rights abuses, as well as addressing forced labor in Xinjiang. They have already taken actions such as imposing visa restrictions, financial sanctions, export controls, import restrictions, and releasing a business advisory. The President also urged the G7 to commit to ensuring global supply chains are free from forced labor, including from Xinjiang. The Administration plans to work with Congress to implement the bill and ensure forced labor is eliminated from global supply chains, while also focusing on reshoring and diversifying key supply chains like semiconductors and clean energy.
