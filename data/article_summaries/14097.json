World Press Freedom Day, observed on May 3, is a reminder of the importance of press freedom. It celebrates the media's role in challenging abuses of power, exposing corruption, and informing citizens. The day also highlights the restrictions, violence, and imprisonment faced by journalists and their families. Last year saw a decline in press freedom globally, with governments in China, Ethiopia, Iran, and Venezuela limiting access to information and technology. The number of journalists killed for their work reached a record high, including the massacre of 30 journalists in the Philippines. Most of the journalists killed were local news-gatherers. The case of Chauncey Bailey, a local journalist in Oakland, California, who was murdered for his expos√©s, is mentioned as an example of the need for accountability. Many journalists and bloggers are also imprisoned worldwide, with Iran having the highest number of jailed journalists. Despite the risks, countless journalists continue to inform their communities, and on World Press Freedom Day, their dedication is honored as a vital part of democracy.
