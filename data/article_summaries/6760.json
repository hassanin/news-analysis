The White House National Economic Council (NEC) and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) recently hosted a Small Business Lending Summit to discuss the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to support small businesses and expand access to capital for underserved entrepreneurs. The summit brought together SBA lending partners to discuss shared priorities for supporting small business growth and to learn about the implementation of administration policies. The SBA announced the creation of a Small Business Lending Federal Advisory Committee to gather feedback from lenders and stakeholders on meeting the capital needs of small businesses, especially in underserved communities. Last year, the SBA provided $50 billion in capital to small businesses, including record amounts to women-owned, Latino-owned, and Black-owned businesses. Under President Biden, there has been a surge in new business applications and an increase in business ownership rates among Hispanic and Black households. The summit included discussions on emerging trends in small business lending, strategies for promoting equity, and the role of data collection and reporting in targeting lending to underserved communities.
