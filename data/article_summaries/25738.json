The Chief of Nogales Station in Arizona highlights the crisis at the border, stating that the immigration system is overwhelmed and broken. He explains that the current population of illegal aliens is primarily made up of families and children, who exploit loopholes in the laws to enter the country. The lack of capacity to detain these individuals results in their release, creating vulnerabilities that are exploited by organized criminal syndicates. The Chief also mentions the use of camouflage by those who do not want to be arrested. He emphasizes the need for action to address the ongoing threat and degradation of border security. The Vice President expresses gratitude for the work of law enforcement and acknowledges the crisis on the southern border. He pledges to provide resources and build physical barriers, as well as make changes to the law to end the humanitarian crisis. The Vice President also calls on Congress to close loopholes in asylum laws, allow for the return of individuals to their home countries, and address the issue of catch and release. He emphasizes the need for bipartisan action to address the broken system and ensure the security of the American people.
