General Motors (GM) has announced its largest-ever investment of $7 billion, which will create 4,000 new jobs at electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing sites in Michigan. This move is seen as a testament to the success of the US government's economic strategy in promoting American manufacturing. The administration has been committed to ensuring that America takes the lead in the future of EV manufacturing. This announcement is part of a larger trend, with over $100 billion invested in American auto manufacturing for EVs and batteries in the past year. The government has been actively involved in promoting the growth of the EV industry, including hosting meetings with the United Auto Workers and automakers, signing an executive order aimed at achieving a 50% EV sales share by 2030, and setting ambitious new standards. The recently passed Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is also seen as a significant step toward this future by investing in EV charging infrastructure. Congress has the opportunity to further accelerate this progress by providing additional incentives for Made in America EVs, batteries, and semi-conductors manufactured by union workers.
