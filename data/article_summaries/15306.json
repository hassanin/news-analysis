Vice President Biden announced that Amtrak will receive $1.3 billion in grant funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to expand passenger rail capacity. The funding will be used to upgrade railroad assets and infrastructure, including the replacement of a major drawbridge on the Northeast Corridor, repairs to Amtrak facilities nationwide, the repair and return to service of stored and damaged passenger cars, and the rehabilitation of major elements of the electrification system. The projects will result in increased capacity, improved operational reliability, and increased passenger comfort and accessibility at stations. Amtrak plans to hire skilled workers laid off from nearby manufacturing facilities for the repairs to passenger cars. The funding will also be used to rebuild three rotary frequency converters in Pennsylvania and make repairs to dozens of aging Amtrak facilities throughout the country. Additionally, the funding will be used to restore Wilmington, Delaware's historic train station, construct a new station for the Auto Train in Sanford, Florida, and install Positive Train Control on certain Amtrak-owned lines.
