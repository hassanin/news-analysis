On National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. honors the more than half a million service members who were prisoners of war. He acknowledges their sacrifice in defending freedom for their fellow Americans and recognizes the grave costs of war. The president commemorates the 50th anniversary of Operation Homecoming, which brought back nearly 600 Americans held captive during the Vietnam War, as well as the 70th anniversary of Operations Big Switch and Little Switch, which repatriated over 3,700 American prisoners of the Korean War. He emphasizes that prisoners of war from all conflicts in American history are among the bravest of the nation, serving honorably under challenging circumstances. President Biden affirms the country's sacred obligation to equip those sent into harm's way and care for them and their families upon their return. He pledges to honor the sacrifice of former prisoners of war, work towards bringing home those still missing in action, and never forget the dedication of current service members defending the nation's values. The president proclaims April 9, 2023, as National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day and calls upon Americans, as well as government officials and organizations, to observe the day by honoring the service and sacrifice of former prisoners of war.
