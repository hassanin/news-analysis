The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs recently held a roundtable for Latino elected leaders to discuss President Biden's Build Back Better agenda. The roundtable included discussions on how the agenda would benefit Latino families in areas such as COVID-19 response, job creation, climate crisis, and support for working families. The meeting was part of the White House's activities for Hispanic Heritage Month, which also included virtual discussions with Latino Cabinet Members and meetings with Latino leaders and farmworkers.
