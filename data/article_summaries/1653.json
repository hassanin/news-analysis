The United States has expressed deep concern over recent developments in Niger and strongly condemns any attempt to detain or undermine the democratically elected government led by President Bazoum. The US specifically urges elements of the presidential guard to release President Bazoum and avoid violence. The US welcomes the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union in defending Niger's democracy. The US is closely monitoring the situation to ensure the safety of its citizens. Niger is considered a critical partner for the US, with shared values on democracy and human rights. The two countries collaborate on regional security and prosperity, but the US expects Niger to uphold democratic standards for continued cooperation.
