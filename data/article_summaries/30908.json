The article discusses the flaws in the US immigration system that allow aliens to illegally cross the borders and settle in American communities. It highlights the issue of porous borders, legal loopholes, and insufficient immigration enforcement resources that contribute to this problem. The article states that waves of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) and Family Units have been exploiting these weaknesses to enter and remain in the country. It mentions that since fiscal year 2016, over 107,000 UACs have been released into the interior of the United States, and only 3.5 percent of apprehended UACs are eventually removed from the country. The article also mentions the surge of UACs and Family Units entering the US and the constraints on detaining them. It concludes that these loopholes encourage illegal immigration and prevent the removal of aliens once they are in the country, leading to a continuous flow of illegal immigration.
