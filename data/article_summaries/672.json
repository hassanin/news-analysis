President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to North Korea will continue beyond June 26, 2023. This national emergency was initially declared in Executive Order 13466 on June 26, 2008, and has been expanded and addressed further in subsequent executive orders. The President cites the risk of weapons-usable fissile material proliferation on the Korean Peninsula, destabilizing actions and policies of the North Korean government, and the threat posed to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States as reasons for the continuation of the national emergency.
