The Vice President, Kamala Harris, spoke in Milwaukee, Wisconsin about the importance of addressing the issue of lead pipes. She thanked Deanna, a mother who has been advocating for this issue, and acknowledged the efforts of Administrator Regan, Senator Tammy Baldwin, Congresswoman Gwen Moore, and the Mayor of Milwaukee. Harris highlighted that lead pipes intersect with various other issues such as public health, education, environmental justice, and labor unions. She emphasized that eliminating lead exposure should be a top priority, as millions of people in America are exposed to lead every day. Harris also mentioned the negative impact of lead exposure on children and adults, and the need to replace lead pipes. The Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan aims to remove and replace all lead pipes within the next 10 years, with $15 billion allocated nationally for this effort, including $48 million for Wisconsin in 2022. These investments will create jobs, improve public health, and support apprenticeship programs. Harris concluded by emphasizing the urgency of addressing this issue for the well-being of future generations.
