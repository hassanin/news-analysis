President Obama has announced a new cybersecurity legislative proposal and other efforts to secure cyberspace. The proposal promotes better information sharing between the private sector and government, encourages the formation of private sector-led Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations, and safeguards personal privacy. It also includes provisions to modernize law enforcement authorities to combat cybercrime, such as prosecuting the sale of botnets and criminalizing the overseas sale of stolen U.S. financial information. The proposal also addresses national data breach reporting by simplifying and standardizing existing state laws into one federal statute. In addition, the White House will host a Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection to address public-private partnerships, improved cybersecurity practices, and the use of more secure payment technologies. Finally, the Department of Energy will provide $25 million in grants over the next five years to support a cybersecurity education consortium consisting of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).
