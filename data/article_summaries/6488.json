Former Secretaries of Defense Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel have warned that brinksmanship on the debt ceiling would have serious consequences for national security. They argue that such actions would damage America's economic credibility and weaken the nation's security by interfering with the ability to pay troops and maintain military readiness. They emphasize the importance of the United States' word being trusted to protect national security and maintain strong alliances. They also highlight the potential impact of defaulting on financial obligations, particularly in regards to conflicts with Russia and China. The former Defense Secretaries call on Congressional Republicans to take the threat of default off the table and prioritize the country's fiscal plans. They stress that raising the debt limit is crucial for protecting America's credibility, word, and leadership in the world.
