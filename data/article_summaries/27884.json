In this statement, the Administration reaffirms its commitment to finding better solutions for the more than 34 million Americans living with diabetes. They highlight the importance of addressing the threat of diabetes, particularly in the aging population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that more than 1 in 10 Americans have diabetes, and approximately a third are at a high risk of developing it. The Administration discusses their efforts to combat diabetes through innovative policies, such as promoting physical activity and dietary changes. They also address the increased risk faced by those with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the elderly and those with other chronic conditions. To support seniors in Medicare Part D plans, the Administration has taken action to provide access to a wide range of insulins at a maximum $35 copay for a month's supply and started covering newer insulin delivery devices. Additionally, they have made efforts to make prescription drugs, including anti-diabetic drugs, more affordable and accessible. The Administration highlights their approval of a record number of generic drugs and the first decline in prescription drug prices in nearly 50 years. They emphasize that improving the affordability and accessibility of medications for managing diabetes enhances quality of life and provides security for patients and their loved ones. The statement concludes by expressing prayers for the millions of Americans living with diabetes and a commitment to continue working towards innovative and affordable cures and therapies for a healthier future.
