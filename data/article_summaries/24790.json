The White House has announced that 51 American companies have made commitments to aid refugees in response to the President's Call to Action. These companies, representing over 2.5 million employees and over $775 billion in annual revenue, have pledged to invest, donate, or raise over $650 million. The commitments will provide support for over 6.3 million refugees, educational opportunities for over 80,000 refugees, employment opportunities for over 220,000 refugees, financial inclusion for over 4 million refugees, and partnerships with over 70 refugee-serving NGOs. The Call to Action focuses on three impact areas: education, employment, and enablement. The Partnership for Refugees, established by the Department of State and USA for UNHCR, has provided guidance to private sector organizations and will be taken over by the Tent Foundation on November 1, 2016. The companies that have made commitments include Airbnb, Citigroup, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Google, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, Mastercard, Microsoft, Pearson, SAP, Twitter, Uber, UPS, and Western Union, among others.
