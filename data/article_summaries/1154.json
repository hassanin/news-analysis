On December 9, 2022, the President signed three laws into effect. The first law, H.R. 521, known as the "First Responder Fair RETIRE Act," aims to protect the retirement benefits of federal law enforcement, firefighters, and other qualifying employees who sustain an injury or illness as a result of their employment and are reappointed to certain non-qualifying federal positions. The second law, S. 3369, designates the Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in Atlanta, Georgia, as the Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Lastly, S. 4359 designates the regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Atlanta as the Senator Johnny Isakson Department of Veterans Affairs Atlanta Regional Office. These laws were supported by various representatives and senators who were acknowledged for their leadership.
