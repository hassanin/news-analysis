President Obama has designated two new national monuments in southeastern Utah and southern Nevada to protect important cultural treasures, including rock art, archaeological sites, and sacred lands of Native American tribes. The designation will help preserve these landscapes for future generations. The President has also established a Bears Ears Commission to involve tribal expertise and traditional knowledge in the management of the Bears Ears National Monument. The decision to designate these monuments came after years of public input and proposals from various stakeholders, including tribal governments. The goal is to protect these areas while ensuring that tribes and local communities can still access and benefit from them in the future.
