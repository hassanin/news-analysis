In this statement, the President discusses the Volcker Rule, which was implemented as part of Wall Street reform to prevent another financial crisis. The rule prohibits big banks from using government-insured money to make risky bets that could threaten the entire financial system. The President emphasizes the importance of accountability for CEOs and acknowledges the efforts of Paul Volcker, a former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, in creating this safeguard. He also thanks Secretary Lew and the regulators who worked to finalize the rule. The President calls on Congress to provide adequate funding for the regulators to effectively implement the rule, as it will protect families and businesses from future crises and restore confidence in the financial system.
