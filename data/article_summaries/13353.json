The President of the United States welcomes the progress made in talks between the U.S. and Russia regarding the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons. This framework aims to move Syria's chemical weapons under international control and ultimately destroy them. The goal is to eliminate the threat these weapons pose to the Syrian people, the region, and the world. The international community expects the Assad regime to fulfill its commitments. While progress has been made, there is still more work to be done. The U.S. will continue working with Russia, the UK, France, the UN, and others to ensure the process is verifiable, and there will be consequences if the Assad regime does not comply. If diplomacy fails, the U.S. is prepared to take action. The decision to pursue diplomatic efforts was influenced by the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons, which resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 people. The U.S. believes in deterring the use of chemical weapons and making it clear that such actions will not be tolerated. The President expressed gratitude to Secretary Kerry and Ambassador Samantha Power for their efforts. The use of chemical weapons is seen as a threat to human dignity and global security, and there is a responsibility to create a world free from the fear of such weapons.
