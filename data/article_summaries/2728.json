President Joe Biden has issued an executive order calling for the declassification of information related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The order states that the American people deserve to have a fuller picture of what the government knows about the attacks as the 20th anniversary approaches. While the release of classified information could potentially jeopardize national security, the order emphasizes that information should not remain classified when the public interest in disclosure outweighs the potential damage to national security. The order specifies that various agencies must complete declassification reviews by specific deadlines, including the review of an FBI electronic communication and records withheld during previous investigations. The order also outlines standards for declassification, stating that information may only remain classified if it still requires protection in the interest of national security and that information shall not remain classified to conceal violations of law or prevent embarrassment. Upon completion of the declassification reviews, the Attorney General and relevant agencies must ensure that information meets classification requirements and that non-classified information is disentangled from classified information and made available to the public to the extent practicable. Reports on the results of the declassification reviews must be submitted to the President and congressional intelligence committees, and declassified information should be made publicly available, except for information that would materially impair confidential executive branch deliberations. The order also includes general provisions regarding its implementation and clarifies that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
