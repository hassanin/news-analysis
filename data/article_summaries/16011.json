President Obama will be honoring the Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings and the Major League Soccer champion LA Galaxy at the White House on March 26, 2013. This visit continues the tradition of honoring sports teams for their efforts in giving back to communities. After the ceremony, the teams will host a Let's Move! clinic on the South Lawn of the White House for youth sport participants from across the country. The clinic is supported by MLS WORKS and the Kings Care Foundation, both of which are community outreach initiatives focused on promoting a healthy lifestyle and providing educational and recreational programs for youth. The children participating in the clinic come from various youth sports programs, including Soccer for Success, America SCORES, and NHL's Hockey is for Everyone, which aim to provide structured physical activity, mentorship, and development opportunities for children in underserved areas.
