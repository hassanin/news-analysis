President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed July 2020 as Pledge to America's Workers Month in recognition of the resilience and potential of American workers and industries. The proclamation highlights the ongoing effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy and workforce, with businesses closing, downsizing, and transitioning to remote work, and millions of Americans becoming unemployed. Despite these challenges, the United States economy added 2.5 million jobs in May, signaling a rebound and the beginning of a transition back to strong economic growth. The President's National Council for the American Worker and the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board have been established to reshape education and job training to better meet the needs of American students, workers, and businesses. The Pledge to America's Workers initiative has garnered support from a strong bipartisan majority of governors, companies, trade associations, and unions, committing to provide education and training opportunities for 16 million American students and workers over the next 5 years. The proclamation emphasizes the need to invest in workers to spur economic recovery and remove obstacles to modernizing workforce education. The administration is committed to helping every citizen find economic success and professional fulfillment through non-traditional pathways, data transparency, modernized recruitment and training practices, and lifelong learning opportunities. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the proclamation expresses confidence in the resourcefulness and determination of American workers to overcome and contribute to the country's future prosperity.
