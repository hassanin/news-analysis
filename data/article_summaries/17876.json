The Obama administration has announced the establishment of a new Manufacturing Innovation Institute in San Jose, California, which will focus on advancing the manufacturing of flexible hybrid electronics. The institute, led by the FlexTech Alliance, will receive a total investment of over $171 million, with $75 million in federal funds and over $96 million in non-federal contributions. It will bring together 162 companies, nonprofits, labs, and universities to develop next-generation bendable and wearable electronic devices. The aim is to foster American leadership in manufacturing technologies such as smart bandages, self-monitoring weapons systems, and wearable devices. This is the seventh of nine manufacturing institutes launched by the Obama administration, which has invested over $500 million in these initiatives. The new institute will bridge the gap between applied research and product development, and will focus on improving the performance and reliability of flexible hybrid electronics in various applications, including medical monitoring, healthcare delivery, and device-to-device communications. The institute will also prioritize education and workforce development to train the next generation of scientists, engineers, and technicians in flexible hybrid electronics manufacturing.
