This is a press gaggle aboard Air Force One en route to Fort Hood, Texas. The press secretary, Robert Gibbs, answers questions from reporters about various topics. Some of the questions asked include the President's schedule for meeting with wounded troops, concerns about missed warning signs in the Fort Hood shooting, briefings on the investigation, the President's meeting with Netanyahu, troop numbers in Afghanistan, and the incident between North and South Korea. Gibbs provides some information but also states that the President has yet to make a decision on certain matters.
