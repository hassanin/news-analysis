On January 21, 2015, President Barack Obama sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process will continue beyond January 23, 2015. The crisis involving acts of violence by these terrorists has not been resolved, and they continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency declaration and the sanctions against these terrorists.
