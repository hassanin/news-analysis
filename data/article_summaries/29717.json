On May 17, 2018, Donald J. Trump, the President of the United States, transmitted a social security totalization agreement with Slovenia to Congress. The agreement, titled "Agreement on Social Security between the United States of America and the Republic of Slovenia," was signed in Ljubljana, Slovenia on January 17, 2017. It is accompanied by a legally binding administrative arrangement called "Administrative Arrangement between the United States of America and the Republic of Slovenia for the Implementation of the Agreement on Social Security between the United States of America and the Republic of Slovenia." These agreements aim to coordinate social security systems between the United States and Slovenia in order to eliminate dual social security coverage and taxation, and to prevent the loss of benefit protection for individuals who work in both countries. The agreements are similar to social security totalization agreements already in force with other leading economic partners in Europe and elsewhere. The Department of State and the Social Security Administration concluded that these agreements are in the national interest of the United States. A report on the estimated number of individuals who will be affected by the agreements and their estimated cost effect was also transmitted to Congress.
