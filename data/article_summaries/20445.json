The President is pleased that the Supreme Court has struck down key provisions of Arizona's immigration law. He believes that this decision emphasizes the need for Congress to act on comprehensive immigration reform, as a patchwork of state laws is not a solution to the broken immigration system. However, the President remains concerned about the remaining provision of the Arizona law that requires local law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of anyone they suspect to be here illegally. He agrees with the Court that individuals cannot be detained solely to verify their immigration status and believes that no American should live under a cloud of suspicion based on their appearance. The President emphasizes the importance of ensuring that Arizona law enforcement officials do not enforce this law in a way that undermines the civil rights of Americans. He also highlights that the focus of immigration enforcement should be on border security and criminals who pose a danger to communities, rather than students who are pursuing education. The President expresses his willingness to work with Congress on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses economic and security needs, and upholds the nation's tradition as a nation of laws and immigrants. In the meantime, he promises to use federal resources to protect the safety and civil rights of all Americans and treat all people with dignity and respect. The President believes that the challenges of immigration can be solved in line with the nation's cherished values and the shared responsibility to make the country more generous and hopeful for future generations.
