This National Security Memorandum, titled "Partial Revocation of Presidential Policy Directive 28," is addressed to multiple high-ranking officials in the United States government. It informs them that the Executive Order of October 7, 2022, has established enhanced safeguards for signals intelligence activities that supersede the safeguards previously established by Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28). The Executive Order recognizes the importance of treating all persons with dignity and respect and acknowledges their legitimate privacy interests. It also emphasizes the potential national security risks of improperly disclosing signals intelligence activities. As a result, the policy process outlined in section 3 of PPD-28 and the classified annex to PPD-28 will be maintained. The memorandum revokes PPD-28, except for sections 3 and 6 and the classified annex, which will remain in effect. The memorandum includes general provisions that clarify its implementation and states that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities. The memorandum is signed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
