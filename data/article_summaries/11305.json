President Obama has declared a state of emergency in Washington due to wildfires that have been ongoing since July 9, 2014. This declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate relief efforts and provide assistance to the affected areas. FEMA is authorized to mobilize necessary resources and equipment to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. The federal government will provide 75 percent funding for emergency protective measures. Michael J. Hall has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
