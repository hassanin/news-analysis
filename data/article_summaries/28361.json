President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring September 16-22, 2018, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Week. The proclamation recognizes the significant contributions of HBCUs in promoting equal opportunities for high-quality education and their rich legacy in opening doors to brighter futures for many Americans. Despite facing segregation and racial prejudice, HBCUs have empowered minority students and produced leaders in various fields. The administration is committed to investing in HBCUs to educate future generations, and federal funding for HBCU programs has been increased. There are currently more than 100 HBCUs in the United States, educating nearly 300,000 enrolled students who contribute to the economy and communities. The proclamation encourages educators, public officials, organizations, corporations, and all Americans to observe the week with appropriate programs and activities that acknowledge the contributions of HBCUs and their alumni to the country.
