On April 19, 2017, the President signed into law S. 544, which has a number of provisions related to veterans. The law eliminates the termination date of the Veterans Choice Program, modifies reimbursement and cost-recovery procedures for care provided under the program, and authorizes the sharing of certain veterans' medical records with medical service providers outside the Department of Veterans Affairs.
