The article discusses the importance of addressing domestic violence and the efforts being made to prevent and support survivors. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was created decades ago to address domestic violence as a public issue rather than a private family matter. Domestic violence affects millions of people in the United States and has significant physical, mental, and economic consequences. Despite progress, there is still work to be done in expanding prevention efforts and providing access to safety and healing. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated domestic violence, making it harder for victims to access services and support. The American Rescue Plan and the Fiscal Year 2022 budget allocate additional funding to support domestic violence and sexual assault service providers, as well as culturally-specific community-based organizations. The White House Gender Policy Council is working on the National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence, and efforts are being made to strengthen the response to intimate partner violence in the military and to reauthorize and strengthen VAWA. The article calls on Americans to speak out against domestic violence, educate young people about healthy relationships, and support victims, survivors, and the efforts of advocates and service providers to end domestic violence.
