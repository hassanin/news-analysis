President Biden announced the next phase of the national strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to get the nation closer to normal by July 4th. The President will direct states, tribes, and territories to make all adults eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine by May 1st. Efforts will be made to increase the number of places where people can get vaccinated, including community health centers, pharmacies, and community vaccination centers. The number of people providing and supporting vaccinations will also be increased, with more active duty troops being deployed and a wider pool of qualified professionals able to administer shots. The administration will provide tools to make it easier for individuals to find a vaccine, including a federally-supported website and a call center. Clear guidance will be provided to vaccinated Americans on what they can do, and steps will be taken to reopen schools safely, including providing resources, expanding screening testing, and offering guidance and support. Efforts will also be made to combat variants and expand testing and genomic sequencing.
