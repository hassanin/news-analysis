Illegal immigration along America's Southwest border increased by 230 percent in April compared to the previous year, according to a report from the Department of Homeland Security. This surge in illegal immigration, coupled with the arrival of a caravan of migrants from Central America, highlights the lack of an effective system to manage the flow of both illegal immigrants and asylum-seekers. The flawed immigration system poses both humanitarian and national security concerns at the border. Additionally, "sanctuary city" jurisdictions, empowered by new state laws in California, hinder law enforcement officers from protecting communities from the effects of a broken immigration system. These jurisdictions refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, ignoring detainer requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and failing to notify ICE when criminal aliens are scheduled for release. As a result, law enforcement officers must carry out immigration enforcement duties in more dangerous environments, such as workplaces and residences. The consequences of sanctuary city policies extend beyond their own communities and affect other areas across the country. In response, the Department of Justice has filed legal action against three California laws that obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration law. President Trump has also met with local California officials to discuss efforts to push back against the state's sanctuary status. Many community leaders emphasize their commitment to the U.S. Constitution and their goal of protecting their constituents. While the administration is taking steps to address the issue of sanctuary cities, Attorney General Jeff Sessions urges Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
