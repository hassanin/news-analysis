The United States congratulates the Government of Uganda on capturing one of the senior commanders of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The capture of Maj. Gen. Ceasar Acellam shows Uganda's determination to work with regional forces to eliminate the LRA threat. Uganda and other regional forces are continuing their pursuit of the LRA and keeping its leadership on the run. The United States supports regional governments and the African Union in urging LRA members and abductees to leave the group and surrender peacefully. Assistance is available to help those who defect and surrender reintegrate into their communities. However, despite this progress, the LRA still poses a danger to civilians. The United States is committed to supporting the region and working with the African Union and United Nations to protect civilians and put an end to this threat. A small number of US military advisors are assisting Uganda and regional forces in their efforts. President Obama has emphasized the importance of ending the LRA's activities and ensuring the safety of African children.
