The CDC has released a report showing that the firearm homicide rate in the US has gone down in 2022. This is the first time gun homicides have declined since the sharp increase from 2019 to 2020. President Biden's efforts to address gun violence are seen as a contributing factor to this progress. However, the report highlights that more needs to be done, as gun violence remains a leading cause of death among children and is at epidemic levels. President Biden continues to call for common-sense reforms such as banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as implementing universal background checks. The report also emphasizes that communities of color are disproportionately affected by gun violence, with Black Americans having a rate of gun homicides more than four times higher than the general population. President Biden has taken significant action to reduce gun violence, including signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law and establishing the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. The report underscores the need for further progress in this area to ensure that every American can live without the threat of gun violence.
