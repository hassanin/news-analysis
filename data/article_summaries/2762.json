Yesterday, the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Treasury Department held a meeting with small business leaders, advocates, and mission lenders to discuss the Biden-Harris Administration's small business agenda. The focus was on expanding capital access for underserved small businesses, particularly those owned by minorities. The SBA proposed reforms to make it easier for lenders to offer small dollar loans, while the Treasury Department made historic investments in Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that serve as primary lenders for minority-owned businesses. The SBA also outlined its capital access reform agenda, which includes lifting the moratorium on Small Business Lending Company (SBLC) licenses and streamlining lending criteria. The participants praised the administration's initiatives and emphasized the importance of diversity in capital allocation and the use of technology to scale lending operations.
