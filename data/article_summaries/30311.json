On October 21, 1995, President Trump declared a national emergency regarding significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia. This was done in response to the threat they posed to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, as well as the extreme level of violence, corruption, and harm they caused both domestically and internationally. The national emergency, declared through Executive Order 12978, is set to continue beyond October 21, 2019, as the actions of these traffickers continue to pose a threat and cause harm. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice of this continuation will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
