The statement by the White House Press Secretary discusses the recent developments in Egypt and the United States' response to them. The United States supports core principles such as opposition to violence and repression, defense of universal rights, and support for political and economic reform. The US has condemned the excessive use of force against protesters in Egypt and calls for an independent investigation into the deaths. The statement emphasizes the need for a fundamental solution devised by Egyptians that aligns with universal principles. The US believes that the new Egyptian government should have real authority immediately, and the transition to democracy should continue with expedited elections and measures for security and prevention of intimidation. The full transfer of power to a civilian government should take place in a just and inclusive manner that responds to the aspirations of the Egyptian people. The US reassures its support for the Egyptian people in building a democracy that reflects their great history.
