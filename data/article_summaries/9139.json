Senior officials from the White House and the Department of Justice, along with leaders from major law enforcement groups, met this week to discuss police reform. The Biden-Harris Administration aims to consult with civil rights and law enforcement communities, members of Congress, and victims' families to define a path forward on police reform, including through executive actions. The administration officials emphasized President Biden's support for increased federal funding for local law enforcement and the need for action to improve accountability and trust between law enforcement and communities. The law enforcement groups presented various ideas for potential reforms, such as officer wellness initiatives and enhanced recruitment and training.
