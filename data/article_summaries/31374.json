President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Louisiana and has ordered Federal assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane Zeta from October 26 to October 29, 2020. This declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the parishes of Jefferson, Lafourche, Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, and Terrebonne. The assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in the recovery from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for debris removal in certain parishes, as well as for emergency protective measures in a wider range of parishes. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for Federal funding. John E. Long has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Residents and business owners in the designated parishes can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will be operational seven days a week until further notice. For further information, the FEMA news desk can be contacted.
