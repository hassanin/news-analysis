President Biden is set to issue an Executive Order that will prohibit new investment, trade, and financing by U.S. individuals to, from, or in the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine. The order will also grant the authority to impose sanctions on anyone found to be operating in these areas. The Departments of State and Treasury will release more details soon. The U.S. will also announce additional measures in response to Russia's violation of international commitments. These measures are separate from the economic measures being prepared with allies and partners in case of further Russian invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. is consulting closely with allies, partners, and Ukraine regarding next steps and Russia's escalating actions along the Ukrainian border.
