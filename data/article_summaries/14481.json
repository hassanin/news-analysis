This article is a briefing by a senior administration official on a report by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) that outlines the methodology the administration will use to estimate the number of jobs saved and created under the Recovery Act. The report discusses how the administration met with economists and agencies to develop a system for measuring job creation and emphasizes the importance of accurate measurement. The CEA chair will report to Congress each quarter on the progress. The article also includes a Q&A session with the senior administration official, who answers questions about unemployment rates, economic assumptions, reporting requirements, and the quality of jobs created. The official mentions that the report does not take into consideration changes in economic assumptions and that the baseline unemployment rate may be higher than previously projected. The official also discusses the impact of energy jobs and green jobs on the economy, as well as the need for monitoring and potentially taking additional steps to support job creation.
