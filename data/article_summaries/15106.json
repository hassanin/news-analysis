On July 23, 2009, President Obama visited the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio. He had a brief discussion with doctors and nurses to learn about their innovative healthcare practices and hear their thoughts on health reform and the current state of the healthcare system. After the meeting, President Obama toured an operating room in the clinic's Heart and Vascular Institute, which has been ranked #1 in the nation for the 15th year in a row. During the tour, the President was shown how the clinic performs robotic minimally invasive surgeries. Later in the day, President Obama delivered remarks and held a town hall on health reform with Ohio residents at Shaker Heights High School. Rick Vacha, a retired Teamster struggling to afford healthcare, introduced him at the event.
