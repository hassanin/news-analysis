First Lady Michelle Obama visited a Walmart in Springfield, MO to celebrate American companies that are committed to creating and selling healthy products. The Walmart store she visited was built as part of the company's Let's Move! commitment to open or expand up to 300 stores in communities with limited access to healthy, affordable food. Walmart announced that it has made significant progress in its efforts to make food healthier and more affordable. They have saved customers more than $2.3 billion on fresh fruit and vegetables and opened 86 stores in underserved communities. Walmart also unveiled its "Great For You" icon, a front-of-package label designed to help customers quickly find healthier choices. The event was part of the First Lady's three-city, two-day tour celebrating the three-year anniversary of the Let's Move! campaign.
