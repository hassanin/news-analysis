The Treasury Department estimates that the releases of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by President Biden and international partners have reduced gasoline prices by up to 40 cents per gallon. The Biden Administration is releasing another Notice of Sale to supply additional barrels of crude oil from the SPR, building on the more than 125 million barrels that have already been sold. The Administration is also taking steps to repurchase oil for the SPR in future years to stabilize the market and encourage near-term supply. Since the historic release of one million barrels per day from the SPR earlier this spring, the Department of Energy has sold over 125 million barrels into the market. These actions are in response to the market disruption caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the releases have had a significant impact on mitigating the increase in gasoline prices. The Department of Energy is executing the drawdown at a speed that is about twice the maximum capacity. Additionally, the Administration is proposing a rule that would allow fixed-price forward purchases of crude oil to replenish the SPR and promote market stability. Gasoline prices have been falling for six straight weeks, with more than 40,000 stations across the United States selling gasoline for less than $3.99 per gallon. The Administration will continue to use all available measures to address supply disruptions and provide relief for Americans at the pump.
