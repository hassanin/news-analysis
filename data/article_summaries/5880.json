In a press briefing, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre discussed the potential government shutdown and its impact on various programs and services. She emphasized that the responsibility to avoid a shutdown lies with House Republicans, who are demanding reckless cuts as a condition for keeping the government open. Jean-Pierre highlighted the potential consequences of a shutdown, including the denial of vital nutrition assistance for mothers and young children, the disruption of farm loans and home loans, the closure of national forests, and the furloughing of USDA employees. She stated that a shutdown would have real impacts on real people and called on House Republicans to fulfill their responsibilities. Jean-Pierre also mentioned President Biden's upcoming trip to Detroit to stand in solidarity with UAW workers and reiterated his support for union workers. She emphasized that the President believes workers deserve a fair share and that a record contract should accompany corporations' record profits.
