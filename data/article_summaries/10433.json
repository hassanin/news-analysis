President Obama has declared a state of emergency in Tennessee due to flooding that began on April 26, 2011. This declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate relief efforts and provide assistance to save lives and protect property in the affected areas. FEMA is authorized to mobilize resources and equipment as needed. The emergency measures will be funded at 75% federal funding, and W. Montague Winfield has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the area.
