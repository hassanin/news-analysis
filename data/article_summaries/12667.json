The article announces the opening of the ticket lottery for the 2014 White House Easter Egg Roll. The theme for this year is "Hop into Healthy, Swing into Shape," in support of the First Lady's Let's Move! initiative. The event will feature sports courts, cooking stations, Easter egg rolling, live music, and storytelling. Tickets are free and can be obtained through the lottery on the recreation.gov website. The souvenir eggs come in four colors and include the stamped signatures of the President and First Lady. There is also a commemorative purple "Bo and Sunny" egg available in the 5-pack Collector's Egg Set. The National Park Foundation produces and sells the White House Easter egg, which is given as a souvenir to children attending the event. Elementary and middle school students are invited to submit poster designs for the Easter Egg Roll, with the winning design being used in the program. The deadline for submissions is March 21, 2014.
