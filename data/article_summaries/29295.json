In this article, President Donald J. Trump proclaims April 2019 as National Donate Life Month in the United States. He recognizes the individuals who make the selfless decision to donate organs and tissues, giving the gift of life to others. The article highlights that 2018 was a record-setting year for organ transplants, with over 36,500 organs transplanted, a 5% increase from the previous year. However, there is still a significant need for organs, as there are nearly 114,000 people on the national transplant waiting list, and 20 people die each day while waiting for an organ. One donor can save up to 8 lives through organ donation and enhance up to 50 lives through tissue donation. The article also mentions the need for bone marrow donors, as approximately 17,500 people are diagnosed each year with illnesses requiring a bone marrow transplant. However, many patients cannot find suitable matches in the 30 million adults who have offered to be donors. The article expresses gratitude to those who join organ and tissue registries, as well as healthcare and science professionals who make transplants possible. It encourages individuals to consider becoming organ or tissue donors and calls upon various groups to raise awareness about the urgent need for donors.
