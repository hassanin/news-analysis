The United States and Canada have released a joint statement on their commitment to the Arctic region. They aim to build a sustainable and viable Arctic economy and ecosystem, with low-impact shipping and science-based management of marine resources. The United States is designating most of its Arctic waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas as off-limits to offshore oil and gas leasing indefinitely, while Canada will designate all Arctic Canadian waters as off-limits to future offshore Arctic oil and gas licensing, to be reviewed every five years. Both countries also pledge to support strong Arctic communities by strengthening resilience, supporting the well-being of residents, and reducing reliance on diesel through energy efficiency and renewable power. They will establish sustainable shipping lanes and work towards a binding international agreement to prevent the opening of unregulated fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean. The statement aims to create the largest contiguous area of well-regulated fisheries in the world.
