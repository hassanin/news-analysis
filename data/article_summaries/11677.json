This article is about an executive order signed by President Barack Obama to address the national emergency related to significant malicious cyber-enabled activities. The executive order amends previous orders to include blocking property and interests of individuals or entities involved in cyber activities that pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, economic health, or financial stability of the United States.
