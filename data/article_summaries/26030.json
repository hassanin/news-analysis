On America Recycles Day, the importance of reusing and recycling to minimize waste is recognized. Recycling supports American manufacturing and conserves valuable resources, benefiting the nation's economic and environmental health. The rate of recycling in the United States has increased from less than 7 percent in 1960 to over 34 percent in 2014. However, $9 billion worth of materials are still thrown away each year. Instead of wasting valuable resources, they should be returned to the economy to rebuild the nation's infrastructure and create innovative new products. The administration is committed to expanding the economy by creating better jobs and promoting products made in America, and recycling plays a role in supporting these efforts. Recycling and reuse activities in 2007 accounted for 757,000 American jobs and $36.6 billion in wages. Reusing and recycling allows individuals and communities to contribute to keeping the country's lands beautiful while also growing American jobs and strengthening the economy. The goal is to unleash American manufacturing and inspire even greater American ingenuity.
