The Global Health Worker Initiative (GHWI) was launched by the White House a year ago to address the global shortfall of health workers and strengthen health systems. The initiative aims to align investments in health workers, build partnerships, and reorient global health programs. The United States is providing approximately $10 billion in global health program funding, with programs like PEPFAR and PMI contributing over $1.6 billion annually. The GHWI has four pillars: protecting and supporting health workers, expanding the global health workforce, advancing equity and inclusion, and driving technological advancements and innovation. Concrete outcomes include prioritizing health workers' access to vaccines and protective equipment, creating career pathways, addressing barriers to diversity, and investing in technological advancements.
