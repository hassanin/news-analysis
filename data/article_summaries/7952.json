He highlights the Jewish American experience as a story of faith, fortitude, and progress, closely tied to American identity and the commitment to freedom of religion. He acknowledges the generations of Jewish people who have come to the United States seeking a better life and have made invaluable contributions to the nation through their leadership and achievements. President Biden also recognizes two historic firsts, with the Vice President having a Jewish spouse and a Jewish American becoming the first Majority Leader of the United States Senate.
