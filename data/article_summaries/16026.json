The White House Press Secretary released a statement expressing their pleasure that the Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the nomination of Todd Jones to serve as director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). They highlight the importance of ATF in protecting communities from criminals, gun violence, and terrorism. The statement mentions that ATF has been without a confirmed director for seven years due to Senate Republicans blocking every nominee. They emphasize that Todd Jones is a highly qualified nominee, being a former Marine and current U.S. Attorney with a successful leadership record at ATF. The Senate has previously confirmed him unanimously for a different law enforcement post, making the White House urge the full Senate to swiftly confirm him for this position and provide the ATF with the necessary resources to ensure public safety.
