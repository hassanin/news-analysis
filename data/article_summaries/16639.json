President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring April 2011 as National Donate Life Month. In the proclamation, he highlights the importance of organ and tissue donation and encourages Americans to register as donors. Currently, there are over 110,000 individuals on the waiting list for organ transplants, and the number continues to grow. The President emphasizes the need for more donors to save lives and improve the health of Americans across the country. He calls upon healthcare professionals, volunteers, educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and private organizations to work together to increase the number of organ and tissue donors in the nation.
