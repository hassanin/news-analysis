In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims May 2015 as National Foster Care Month. He emphasizes the importance of providing a fair chance at success for all children, regardless of their background. While progress has been made in reducing the number of children in foster care, there are still over 400,000 children in the system, with over 100,000 waiting to be adopted. Disproportionate numbers of African-American and Native American youth are also in the foster care system, highlighting the disparities faced by these communities. Obama discusses the barriers that children in foster care face, including difficulties in education, financial security, and staying out of the justice system. The administration is committed to expanding possibilities for these children and has implemented initiatives to protect their financial security, improve education and employment opportunities, and prevent children from entering the foster care system. Obama recognizes the importance of families in raising children and encourages individuals from all backgrounds to become foster or adoptive parents. He calls upon all Americans to observe National Foster Care Month and support youth in foster care.
