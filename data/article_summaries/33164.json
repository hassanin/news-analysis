President Donald Trump has published a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the Central African Republic will continue beyond May 12, 2020. This emergency was initially declared in Executive Order 13667 on May 12, 2014. The Central African Republic has been facing issues such as a breakdown of law and order, sectarian tension, widespread violence, and the forced recruitment and use of child soldiers. These problems pose a threat to the peace, security, and stability of not only the Central African Republic but also neighboring states. The President has determined that the national emergency is necessary to address these ongoing threats to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
