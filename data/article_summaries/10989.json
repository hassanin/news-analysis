The Department of Labor (DOL) has announced a new $50.5 million investment in State Expansion Grants to expand apprenticeships across the country. This initiative, called ApprenticeshipUSA, aims to grow and diversify apprenticeship over the next 18 months, resulting in thousands of new apprenticeships in industries such as healthcare, advanced manufacturing, and information technology. The grants will fund new apprenticeship efforts in 36 states and one territory, with a focus on helping a diverse set of workers, including women and minorities. Apprenticeships are seen as a proven pathway to provide American workers with the skills they need for good-paying jobs and to boost productivity and innovation for employers. The Obama Administration has made expanding apprenticeship a priority, adding more than 125,000 new apprenticeships since 2014. However, continued funding is needed to sustain these efforts and provide opportunities for thousands of Americans. The administration is calling on Congress to continue its support for apprenticeship in the final Fiscal Year 2017 spending bill. This investment builds on previous efforts to increase access to apprenticeship and job-driven training, such as the American Apprenticeship Grants and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). The administration is also partnering with employers, communities, and training providers to develop job-driven workforce strategies, such as the TechHire initiative and the Upskill initiative.
