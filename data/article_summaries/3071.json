During a recent press briefing, Dr. Fauci announced that the Biden administration is investing $3.2 billion from the American Rescue Plan into the development of next-generation treatments for COVID-19 and other pandemic threats. The program, called the Antiviral Program for Pandemics, aims to accelerate the development of new antiviral medicines and prepare for future pandemics. The program has two major pillars: development, which focuses on accelerating the clinical testing of promising antiviral medicines already in development, and discovery, which aims to discover new antiviral medications. The funding will support fundamental research, preclinical and clinical evaluation, development and manufacturing, and the creation of Antiviral Drug Discovery Centers. The plan will be informed by the durability of vaccine protection and the need for boosters. The administration is prepared with ample supply to meet any contingency or scenario. The goal is to reach 70% vaccination rate in the US, and the administration is confident that this goal will be achieved and surpassed. The administration is also working on distributing vaccines to other countries, with 80 million doses committed to be shared by the end of June. The CDC will provide more information on boosters and vaccine effectiveness at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Additionally, the administration is addressing clinician burnout and supporting their mental health and well-being with funding for training and wellness programs. The briefing emphasized the importance of vaccination, as it remains the best way to protect against COVID-19 and its variants.
