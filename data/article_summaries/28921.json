President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in Louisiana due to the impact of Hurricane Delta. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local response efforts. The Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will coordinate disaster relief efforts to alleviate hardship and suffering caused by the emergency. The assistance will focus on emergency measures to save lives, protect property, and ensure public health and safety. The declaration includes public assistance for various parishes, with Category B emergency protective measures and direct federal assistance being provided. Pete Gaynor, the Administrator of FEMA, has named John E. Long as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas.
