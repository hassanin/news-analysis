Yesterday, senior officials from the White House and the Department of Justice met with leaders from civil rights organizations to discuss police reform. The Biden-Harris Administration is consulting with members of the civil rights and law enforcement communities, members of Congress, and victims' families to define a path forward on meaningful police reform, including through executive actions. The administration officials present at the meeting were Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond, and Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta. They emphasized the President's belief in holding law enforcement officers accountable for violating their oaths. The civil rights leaders stressed the urgent need for action, including broader investments in communities. They also highlighted the need for improved data collection on interactions between law enforcement and the public. Additionally, they emphasized the importance of Congressional action to ensure comprehensive and lasting changes, as executive action alone cannot achieve this.
