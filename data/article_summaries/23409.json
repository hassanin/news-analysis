The article announces the launch of Trade Africa, a partnership between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa aimed at increasing trade within Africa and expanding economic ties with other global markets. The initial focus of Trade Africa is on the member states of the East African Community (EAC), including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. The EAC is seen as an economic success story with stable regulations and promising local enterprises. The goal of Trade Africa is to double intra-regional trade in the EAC, increase EAC exports to the United States by 40%, and reduce the time needed for import/export and transit at borders. The United States also plans to collaborate with other regional economic communities in Africa and will discuss increasing trade between the United States and Africa at the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum in August. Trade Africa aims to support increased U.S.-EAC trade and investment through activities such as exploring an investment treaty, negotiating a trade facilitation agreement, establishing a commercial dialogue, and transforming trade hubs into trade and investment centers. The United States also supports the EAC's efforts to advance regional integration and plans to form public-private partnerships to stimulate greater trade under AGOA.
