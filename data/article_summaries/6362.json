The Supreme Court has made a decision that overturns previous precedent and threatens the diversity and progress made by colleges and universities in creating inclusive environments. However, the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to fighting for racial equity, civil rights, and educational opportunity. President Biden is urging colleges and universities to use this opportunity to expand access to education for all. He is calling on them to consider the adversities students have faced and to value their resilience and determination. The administration is taking action to support colleges and universities in creating pathways to success for all students. This effort is part of their larger goal of ensuring equal access to higher education.
