Former U.S. Senator Jeremiah Denton, who served as a naval aviator in Vietnam and later represented Alabama in the U.S. Senate, has passed away. Denton was shot down during the war and spent nearly eight years as a prisoner of war, enduring torture, starvation, and solitary confinement. His bravery and that of his fellow POWs was inspiring to the nation and continues to inspire those who serve today. Denton was a strong advocate for national security during his time as Senator and leaves behind a legacy of heroic service. President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama offer their condolences to the Denton family.
