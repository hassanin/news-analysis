This article is a presidential memorandum issued by President Barack Obama in 2011. The memorandum designates certain officers of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to act as the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in case the DNI and the Principal Deputy Director are unable to perform their duties. The order of succession is outlined, with the Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Intelligence Integration being the first in line, followed by the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, and then the National Counterintelligence Executive. The memorandum also states that the President has the discretion to depart from this order in designating an acting DNI. The memorandum revokes a previous presidential memorandum from 2008 on the same subject.
