President Trump signed an executive order to address the crisis of missing and murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives, particularly women and children. The order establishes Operation Lady Justice, an interagency task force led by Attorney General William Barr and Secretary David Bernhardt, to develop a government-wide strategy to end this problem. The Department of Justice will also issue grants to improve safety in Native American communities. The President acknowledged the seriousness of the issue and expressed his commitment to bring safety and justice to tribal communities. Several Native American leaders attended the signing ceremony and expressed their appreciation for the President's actions. In addition to this executive order, the Trump administration has taken other initiatives to support American Indians and Alaska Natives, such as restoring benefits to Alaska Natives who served in Vietnam and improving the health and safety of children in the care of the Indian Health Service.
