On April 6, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a statement regarding the imposition of tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. The tariffs, which came into effect on March 23, 2018, impose a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles and a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on steel articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. The President concurred with the Secretary of Commerce's findings that these imports threaten to impair the national security of the United States. However, on March 22, 2018, the President temporarily suspended the tariffs for certain countries until May 1, 2018, to allow for discussions on alternative means to address the national security concerns. The President also authorized a process for affected parties to apply for exclusions for specific aluminum or steel products. The Secretary of Commerce will evaluate these exclusion requests, considering national security considerations and the availability of satisfactory quality products produced in the United States.
