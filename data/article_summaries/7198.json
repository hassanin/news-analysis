The 2021 UN Food Systems Summit is an extension of the United States' commitment to ending hunger, malnutrition, and poverty and building sustainable and resilient food systems. President Biden announced a $10 billion commitment to strengthen food security, accelerate climate change mitigation and adaptation, and expand inclusive food systems. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack and USAID Administrator Samantha Power also reaffirmed the United States' commitment to working with domestic and international partners to tackle hunger and poverty. The Summit focused on concrete actions to transform food systems and address the challenges of COVID-19, conflict, and climate change. The U.S. government hosted three National Food Systems Dialogues to discuss challenges and opportunities for food system transformation in the United States. The $10 billion in investments will strengthen food systems in the United States, support climate smart agriculture and forestry, and invest in global hunger and food security initiatives. The United States also committed to launching the Global Coalition on Sustainable Productivity Growth for Food Security and Resource Conservation, advancing the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate, and joining coalitions to combat food loss and waste and expand school feeding programs. The United States will share its expertise and experience to help other countries eliminate hunger and build sustainable food systems.
