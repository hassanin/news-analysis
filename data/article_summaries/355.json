The First Lady and Ambassador Whitman visited Lositeti Village in Kajiado County, Kenya to address the severe drought and its impact on the local community. They observed that the drought has caused the death of livestock, which is the main source of income for the villagers. As a result, the people are struggling to feed their families and send their children to school. The United States is currently providing 70% of the budget for aid in the region, but the First Lady emphasized the need for other countries to join in the effort. Ambassador Whitman expressed gratitude for the aid and stressed the importance of continued support, as the drought is expected to persist.
