President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, transmitting a strategic plan titled "Strategy to Support the Disarmament of the Lord's Resistance Army." This plan is in line with the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009. The strategy aims to mitigate and eliminate the threat posed by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) to civilians and regional stability. It has four objectives: increasing protection of civilians, apprehending or removing Joseph Kony and senior commanders, promoting the defection and disarmament of LRA fighters, and providing humanitarian access and relief to affected communities. The strategy involves coordination between various U.S. departments and agencies, including the Department of State, Department of Defense, U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Intelligence Community. The President expresses his administration's commitment to working closely with Congress on this issue.
