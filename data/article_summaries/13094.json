The United States and Russia have agreed to enhance their bilateral cooperation in various areas such as arms control, nonproliferation, international security, trade and investment, counterterrorism, and strengthening ties between their societies. They plan to maintain regular contacts at the highest level and hold a U.S.-Russia summit in Moscow in September 2013. The dialogue between the U.S. Vice President and the Russian Prime Minister will be expanded to discuss trade and investment links. They also aim to establish a regular dialogue between foreign and defense ministers in the "two plus two" format to address strategic stability and shared threats. The Security Councils of both countries will maintain a regular dialogue on mutual interests. The Bilateral Presidential Commission will continue to play a role in developing engagement across various areas, with over sixty U.S. and Russian government agencies participating. Public and business communities are encouraged to establish close links to bring the countries closer together. Expanding direct contracts and simplifying visa formalities will strengthen mutual understanding and trust.
