On March 27, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum stating that the national emergency declared in relation to South Sudan in 2014 will continue for another year. The national emergency was initially declared due to the threats posed by activities such as violence, atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers and aid workers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations in South Sudan. The President determined that the situation in and in relation to South Sudan still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The Memorandum is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
