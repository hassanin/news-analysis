First Lady Melania Trump and the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) hosted a roundtable on "Improving the Lives of Americans Living with Sickle Cell Disease" in recognition of National Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Awareness Month. This is the first time since 1983 that the White House has elevated this issue with a Presidential Proclamation. The First Lady emphasized the goal of finding a cure and highlighted the children's well-being pillar of her Be Best initiative. Although progress has been made in early identification and new therapies, there is still a need for improved care for SCD patients. Participants shared their experiences of living with SCD or caring for those with the disease, including pain crises and medical complications. The First Lady expressed her commitment to improving care for SCD patients and recognized the bravery of those living with the disease.
