President Biden spoke via teleconference to celebrate the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, which aims to boost semiconductor production in the United States. He emphasized the importance of manufacturing semiconductors domestically, as the global chip shortage during the pandemic highlighted the vulnerabilities of relying on overseas production. The President praised the auto industry and its use of semiconductors, noting that the bill will support the entire semiconductor supply chain, from research and development to manufacturing. He highlighted the job creation potential of the bill, stating that it will create over a million construction jobs and ensure that many of these jobs are good-paying union jobs. The President also emphasized the need to protect taxpayers' dollars and the interests of American workers, small businesses, and communities. He expressed his commitment to ensuring that innovation and manufacturing happen in America, and that entrepreneurs and start-ups do not have to go overseas to commercialize their inventions. President Biden concluded by urging Americans to have faith in the country's capacity to accomplish great things when working together.
