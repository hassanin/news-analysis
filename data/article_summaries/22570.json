The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has approved a resolution authorizing U.S. military action in Syria. The resolution aims to degrade Assad's chemical weapons capability and deter future use of these weapons. The White House commends the Senate for working across party lines and believes that America is stronger when the President and Congress work together. They will continue to work with Congress to build bipartisan support for a military response that is narrowly tailored to enforce the prohibition on chemical weapons and protect national security interests.
