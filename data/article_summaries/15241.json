The White House is expressing dismay at the decision by the Jerusalem Planning Committee to move forward with the approval process for the expansion of Gilo in Jerusalem. They believe that these actions make it more difficult for negotiations to succeed and that neither party should engage in efforts or take actions that could unilaterally pre-empt negotiations. The US also objects to other Israeli practices in Jerusalem, such as the evictions and demolitions of Palestinian homes. They emphasize that the status of Jerusalem is a permanent status issue that must be resolved through negotiations between the parties.
