This article is a memorandum from the White House Counsel, Robert F. Bauer, regarding the review of discussions relating to Congressman Joe Sestak. The memorandum addresses allegations that government positions were improperly offered to Congressman Sestak to dissuade him from running for the United States Senate. The White House has concluded that these allegations are based on factual errors and lack a basis in the law.

The memorandum clarifies that Congressman Sestak was not offered the position of Secretary of the Navy, as President Obama had announced his intent to nominate Ray Mabus for the position before Sestak announced his Senate candidacy. It also confirms that options for uncompensated advisory board positions within the Executive Branch were raised with Sestak in an effort to avoid a divisive Senate primary and allow him to retain his House seat. Former President Clinton was enlisted to discuss these options with Sestak, but he ultimately declined them and remained committed to his Senate candidacy.

The memorandum asserts that these discussions were not improper and were consistent with past practices of previous administrations, both Democratic and Republican, when considering alternative paths to service for individuals considering campaigns for public office.
