The statement by the Press Secretary discusses the importance of H.R. 34, the 21st Century Cures Act. The legislation provides resources to combat the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic, as well as invests in cancer research and biomedical research initiatives. It also includes provisions to improve mental health and the drug approval process. While the bill is not perfect, the administration believes that its advances in health outweigh any concerns. The statement urges the Senate to pass the bill promptly so that the President can sign it.
