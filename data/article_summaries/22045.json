President Obama has declared a major disaster in Arkansas and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in eight counties, including grants for housing and repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other recovery programs. Federal funding will also be provided for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will coordinate recovery operations, and additional counties may receive assistance after further assessments. Residents and business owners can apply for assistance online or by phone.
