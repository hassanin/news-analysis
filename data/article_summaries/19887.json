In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims the designation of three countries - CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Guinea, and Niger - as eligible sub-Saharan African countries and beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). These countries meet the eligibility requirements set forth in the AGOA and the Trade Act of 1974. Additionally, the proclamation modifies the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to reflect this designation. The three countries are also considered lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries under section 112(c) of the AGOA. The proclamation is signed on October 25, 2011.
