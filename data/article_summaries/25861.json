President Donald Trump has signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, which includes a provision for the establishment of a Tribal Advisory Committee. However, the President has instructed the Secretary of Agriculture not to establish the Committee as it includes legislative branch appointees, which is not consistent with the separation of powers. Instead, the President will work with Congress to revise the section of the Act to allow for a properly constituted committee to be established within the Department of Agriculture. The President also mentioned that the Act allows the Department of Agriculture to use funds for certain programs in Cuba, but these funds should not be used to undermine the foreign policy of the United States towards Cuba. The President stated that his administration will not use taxpayer funds from these programs to benefit the Cuban regime.
