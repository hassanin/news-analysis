The United States and the European Union are working together to address the global pandemic and its aftermath. They have set five goals for their collaboration: vaccine equity, strengthening global supply chains and manufacturing, enhancing global health security architecture, preparing for future threats, and research and development for new vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. The US and EU are committed to ensuring vaccine equity by sharing a total of 1.9 billion doses globally and focusing on sub-Saharan Africa. They also aim to strengthen global supply chains and manufacturing to ensure the availability of vaccines and treatments. The two parties will enhance coordination to improve global health security and support the establishment of a new Financial Intermediary Fund for pandemic preparedness and global health security. They will also collaborate on pathogen detection and monitoring, joint threat assessment and response, and research and development for new medical tools.
