The Presidential Memorandum issued on December 22, 2020, grants authority to the Attorney General to use classified information in connection with the review of intelligence activities relating to the 2016 Presidential campaigns. The Attorney General is currently conducting this review, which has developed into a criminal investigation led by John Durham. The memorandum also authorizes the Attorney General to declassify or downgrade information as necessary and to use classified information in a grand jury or other proceeding. The memorandum specifies that its authority will terminate upon the conclusion of the Special Counsel's investigation, unless extended by the President. It also states that it does not create any substantive or procedural rights enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities. The memorandum is signed by Donald J. Trump.
