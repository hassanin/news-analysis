The Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, National Economic Council Director, and Council of Economic Advisers Chair hosted a virtual event with CEOs and senior executives in the housing and homebuilding sector. The event aimed to address supply chain disruptions and shortages in the availability of homes for purchase and rent. Participants discussed the challenges caused by short-term supply chain disruptions, including fluctuations in lumber prices, disruptions in critical inputs, transportation challenges, and underinvestment in training and workforce development. The event also focused on the demand for housing and how the President's investments in the Build Back Better agenda will expand housing supply and strengthen affordable housing.
