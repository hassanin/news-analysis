Karen Pence, the Second Lady, visited Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center to learn about their creative arts therapies program. She spoke with clients ranging from 5 years old to adults and witnessed the benefits of art therapy and music therapy for both the families and the clients. One family was so impacted by music therapy that the mother learned to play the ukulele and now plays guitar with her daughter. Another young man used bongo drumming to relearn how to walk and move his muscles. A couple shared how art therapy helped them cope with the loss of their infant baby. Cincinnati Children's has two full-time music therapists and two full-time art therapists dedicated to serving their clientele.
