In his weekly address, President Trump criticized Senate Democrats for obstructing the confirmation process of his nominees and blocking improvements to border security. He claimed that his nominees face longer confirmation waits than any in history, with over 300 still awaiting a vote. He highlighted the case of Isabel Patelunas, who has been waiting for confirmation as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Intelligence and Analysis for almost a year. Trump also accused Democrats of not caring about border security and blocking efforts to close loopholes and stop the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs. He called on Senate Democrats to stop resisting the will of the American people and start working across the aisle.
