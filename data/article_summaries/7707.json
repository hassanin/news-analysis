President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed May 12, 2023, as Military Spouse Appreciation Day in honor of the nearly one million military spouses who support and strengthen the nation alongside their loved ones in uniform. Military spouses make sacrifices for values and freedoms, caring for others while balancing responsibilities at home and work. They bring diverse talents to provide for their families and communities and forge lasting friendships with other military spouses. The administration is committed to supporting military spouses through various initiatives, including broadening pathways to federal careers, connecting them with private sector employers, and expanding scholarship opportunities. Efforts are also being made to increase access to affordable child care and parental leave for service members. The president calls upon communities to hire and support military spouses, recognizing their unique skills and experiences. The proclamation acknowledges the extraordinary commitment and fortitude of military spouses, who often go unrecognized for their service and sacrifice. The day is meant to lift up their stories, invest in their abilities, and provide the support they need to achieve their aspirations. The proclamation concludes with a blessing for military spouses, families, and troops.
