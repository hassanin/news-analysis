In response to the challenges faced by nursing home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden has launched an action plan to improve safety and quality of care in nursing homes. The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new actions to increase accountability in the nursing home industry and make them safer. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will strengthen accountability for nursing homes in the Special Focus Facilities (SFF) Program, which oversees the poorest performing nursing homes in the country. The reforms will provide more resources and inspections to ensure improvement. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) are highlighting funds to support good-paying, union jobs in the nursing home industry. The administration's efforts also build on previous actions taken to improve nursing home quality and accountability.
