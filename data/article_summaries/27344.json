President Donald Trump has transmitted his Administration's principles for reforming the nation's Air Traffic Control (ATC) System. The principles aim to protect and improve the ATC system, which contributes roughly 5 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Despite using outdated technology and facilities, U.S. air traffic controllers are considered the best in the world. However, with increased air traffic, the current ATC system will not be able to handle the expected volume over the next two decades. Congestion and delays already cost the U.S. economy over $25 billion per year. The Federal Government's investment of $1 billion per year in the NextGen Program's improved ATC technology has proven insufficient, with estimates suggesting an additional $80 billion may be needed to complete the program. Other industrialized countries have separated their ATC functions from the government, leading to accelerated modernization, improved safety, and lower operating costs. The proposal suggests creating a new, not-for-profit ATC entity that will leverage private capital to enable faster modernization and immediate safety and operational improvements for all system users. President Trump hopes to work with Congress to enact these reforms into law.
