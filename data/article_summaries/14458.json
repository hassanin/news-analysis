The President of the United States welcomes the announcement of the first fully multilateral trade agreement in the history of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Bali, Indonesia. This agreement, particularly the trade facilitation agreement, aims to eliminate bureaucratic delays and red tape for global trade. Small businesses are expected to benefit the most from this deal, as they face the greatest difficulties in navigating the current system. The new WTO deal is estimated to have a global economic value worth hundreds of billions of dollars. This agreement also signifies the revival of the multilateral trading system that supports millions of American jobs and enables the enforcement of America's trade rights. The United States takes pride in its leadership role in reaching this accord and congratulates WTO Director-General Roberto Carvalho de AzevÃªdo and fellow WTO members on this achievement.
