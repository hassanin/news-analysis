President Trump has signed the Great American Outdoors Act into law, prioritizing conservation and stewardship of public lands and national parks. The legislation provides up to $1.9 billion per year for five years to fund deferred maintenance projects in national parks, forests, wildlife reserves, and other public lands. This funding will address the significant need for improvements in infrastructure, including roads, trails, and buildings. The law also permanently funds the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which supports the preservation and development of parks and outdoor recreation areas across the country. In addition to benefiting the environment, the Great American Outdoors Act is expected to stimulate local economies by attracting more visitors to national parks and surrounding communities. The legislation aims to ensure that national treasures can be enjoyed by future generations and highlights the connection between a strong economy and a healthy environment.
