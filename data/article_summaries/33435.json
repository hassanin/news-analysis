President Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Nevada due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to the state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency protective measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Robert J. Fenton as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
