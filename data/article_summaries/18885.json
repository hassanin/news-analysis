In June 2010, the White House Press Secretary released a statement regarding Andrew Romanoff's application for a position at USAID during the Presidential transition. Romanoff applied through the Transition online process, and after the new administration took office, he followed up with phone calls to White House personnel. Jim Messina, a White House representative, contacted Romanoff in September to inquire if he was still interested in a position at USAID or if he was running for the US Senate, as had been reported. The President had already endorsed Senator Michael Bennet for the Colorado seat, and Messina wanted to avoid a costly battle between two supporters. However, Romanoff stated that he was committed to the Senate race and was no longer interested in working for the Administration. It is important to note that there was no offer of a job made to Romanoff.
