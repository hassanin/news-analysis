During a press briefing, White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield highlighted President Biden's proposed budget investments to uphold the country's obligations to veterans and address the mental health crisis. The budget includes funding to improve VA services, reduce veteran suicide, end veteran homelessness, and address military toxic exposures. It also includes investments to combat the opioid epidemic and reduce the illicit supply of drugs in communities. Bedingfield also mentioned the success of the President's industrial policy, with electric vehicle maker VinFast investing $4 billion in North Carolina, creating thousands of jobs. She discussed the importance of infrastructure investments, such as EV charging stations, and the Bipartisan Innovation Act, which aims to boost manufacturing and strengthen supply chains. Bedingfield also answered questions about the President's call with European leaders, the FDA approving a fourth COVID-19 booster shot, the ongoing situation in Ukraine, and other topics.
