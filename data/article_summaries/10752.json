President Obama called President Medvedev to acknowledge the progress made in resolving bilateral issues between Russia and the United States. These issues needed to be resolved before Russia could join the World Trade Organization (WTO). The Russian government has made significant efforts, including passing legislation to protect intellectual property rights, to meet bilateral commitments and accelerate negotiations for Russia's WTO accession. President Obama pledged to support Russia's efforts to complete the remaining steps for WTO membership. They also discussed the importance of enhancing bilateral trade relations, including intellectual property rights enforcement and agricultural trade. The two presidents also talked about their mutual interest in getting their respective legislative bodies to approve the New START treaty, their concern about Iran's defiance of international obligations, and their support for upcoming referenda in Sudan.
