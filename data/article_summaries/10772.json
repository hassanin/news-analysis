This article discusses the six month anniversary of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the benefits it provides to Americans. The ACA aims to reform health insurance by holding insurance companies accountable, lowering costs, increasing choices, and improving the quality of healthcare. On the anniversary, President Obama met with Americans who have benefited from the ACA and celebrated the implementation of the Patient's Bill of Rights, which includes various consumer protections. These protections include banning discrimination against children with pre-existing conditions, prohibiting insurance companies from dropping coverage, eliminating lifetime limits on coverage, allowing choice of doctors, preventing restrictions on emergency room care, guaranteeing the right to appeal insurance company decisions, allowing young adults to stay on their parents' plan until age 26, and covering preventive care with no out-of-pocket cost. The article also highlights the progress made in fighting waste, fraud, and abuse, fighting premium increases, supporting small businesses, making prescription drugs more affordable, launching a new website to help consumers find coverage, and providing coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.
