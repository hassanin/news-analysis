President Barack Obama has proclaimed March 2016 as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month in the United States. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the country, with over 130,000 Americans being diagnosed and nearly 50,000 dying from the disease each year. Risk factors for colorectal cancer include age, obesity, certain genetic mutations, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, inflammatory bowel disease, and family history of colorectal cancer. Regular screenings are encouraged for individuals between the ages of 50 and 75, although people of all ages should consult a physician about their susceptibility. Early detection and treatment are crucial in battling colorectal cancer. President Obama has also announced a national effort led by Vice President Joe Biden to cure cancer within 5 years, and a $1 billion initiative has been proposed to kick off this work. The Affordable Care Act requires health care plans to cover certain recommended preventive services, including cancer screening tests, at no additional cost. It also prohibits insurance companies from charging more for pre-existing conditions, including cancer. The President urges all citizens, government agencies, private businesses, non-profit organizations, and other groups to increase awareness and prevention of colorectal cancer during National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.
