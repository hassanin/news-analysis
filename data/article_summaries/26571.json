On December 30, 2020, the President signed several laws into effect. These include the "Indian Community Economic Enhancement Act of 2020," which amends existing statutes promoting Native American business, economic development, and trade development. Another law designates the community-based outpatient clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Bozeman, Montana, as the Travis W. Atkins Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic. Additionally, the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Plum Brook Station, Ohio, is renamed as the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility. Several United States Postal Service facilities are also designated with new names, including the Einar "Sarge" H. Ingman, Jr. Post Office Building in Tomahawk, Wisconsin, the Audie Murphy Post Office Building in Greenville, Texas, the Ralph Hall Post Office in Fate, Texas, the Joseph G. Demler Post Office in Port Washington, Wisconsin, and the Robert L. Brown Post Office in Thermopolis, Wyoming. Lastly, the "Secret Service Overtime Pay Extension Act" extends the waiver that allows U.S. Secret Service employees performing protective services to receive premium pay up to level II of the Executive Schedule until 2023.
