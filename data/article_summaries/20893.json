President Barack Obama has announced the continuation of the national emergency regarding the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons that undermine Belarus's democratic processes or institutions. This national emergency, declared in 2006, is being extended due to ongoing threats to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The actions include human rights abuses, political repression, and public corruption. The President has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency in order to address these issues.
