President Biden will sign an Executive Order establishing the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. The initiative aims to address systemic barriers to equity, justice, and opportunity faced by these communities. It will be led by the Department of Health and Human Services and will focus on mitigating COVID-19 related anti-Asian bias, advancing health equity, and promoting equitable recovery. Krystal Kaâ€™ai has been selected as the Executive Director of the Initiative. The Executive Order also establishes a Presidential Advisory Commission on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders to advise the President on advancing equity and opportunity, addressing xenophobia and violence, and tackling intersectional barriers. These actions build on the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to combat bias, violence, and xenophobia against these communities, including signing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law, condemning racism through a Presidential Memorandum, and advancing equity through a whole-of-government initiative. The Administration has also appointed a Senior Liaison to Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities and ensured diverse representation in the Administration. Additionally, the National Science Foundation is funding research to address bias and xenophobia against Asian American communities.
