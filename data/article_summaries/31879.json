President Trump signed into law important legislation that aims to rebuild the military, protect communities, and improve the future for all Americans. The bill increases defense spending to a record $716 billion, including the largest pay raise for military personnel in almost a decade. The administration has also secured funding to acquire 93 new F-35 Lightning Joint Strike Fighters, 142 Apache and Black Hawk helicopters, and 13 Navy battle force ships, all made in the USA. This is the first time in over a decade that the Defense Department has received full year funding without relying on continuing resolutions. The bill also provides additional funding for border security, including $1.6 billion for the border wall. It allocates $1.5 billion to increase school safety, $42 million for school choice, and increased funding for veterans vocational education and career and technical education legislation. It also addresses substance abuse and mental health with $6.7 billion, specifically targeting opioid and heroin abuse. The President believes that this legislation demonstrates that America is being respected again and its people are being protected.
