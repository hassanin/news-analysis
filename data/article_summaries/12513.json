This article announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe. The President declared this national emergency in 2003, blocking the property of certain individuals who were undermining Zimbabwe's democratic processes and institutions. Additional steps were taken in 2005 and 2008 to expand the scope of the national emergency and block the property of those engaged in violence, human rights abuses, and public corruption. The actions and policies of these individuals still pose a threat to the foreign policy of the United States, and therefore, the national emergency must continue. The President has declared the continuation for one year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
