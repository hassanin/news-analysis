The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to target communities with high numbers of uninsured individuals. The challenge aims to engage community leaders in building outreach efforts to help uninsured individuals gain coverage through the Marketplace. At the end of the enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of new signups in each community to the estimated number of eligible uninsured people. The community with the most progress will receive recognition, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama. Milwaukee is one of the 20 communities participating in the challenge.

The article also emphasizes the importance of tax credits in making coverage more affordable, with 90 percent of Marketplace enrollees in Wisconsin receiving tax credits in 2015. It encourages consumers to shop around for the best plan, as switching to the lowest-cost plan within a coverage level could result in significant savings on premium costs.
