Seniors across America will be hosting local meetings and participating in a health care tele-town hall meeting with President Obama. More than a dozen senior Obama Administration officials will attend these meetings to discuss the Affordable Care Act and answer questions. The President's tele-town hall meeting will be broadcast live on C-SPAN. The President will take questions from seniors across the country and discuss the new health care law, as well as efforts to combat senior scams and fraud. The first mailing of $250 rebate checks for seniors on Medicare who fall into the prescription drug coverage gap known as the "donut hole" will also be discussed. Approximately 4 million seniors nationwide will receive rebate checks. Various organizations, such as AARP, AFL-CIO, and American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, have worked to organize these local meetings.
