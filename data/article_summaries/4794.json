Vice President is in Florida to address several issues. She will be speaking with a group of Black women leaders about pressing issues for women, including abortion rights. She will also meet with Florida State legislators and American servicemembers in Tampa. The Vice President believes that protecting the rights of American women, including those in Florida, is important. She criticizes a recently passed law in Florida that restricts women's choices and does not have exceptions for cases of rape or incest. The Vice President wants to work with leaders to protect women's rights and ensure that personal decisions are made by women themselves, not the government.
