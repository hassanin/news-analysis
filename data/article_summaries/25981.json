OMB Director Mick Mulvaney held a press briefing to discuss the comprehensive plan for reforming the federal government and reducing the federal civilian workforce. Mulvaney emphasized that the government reorganization is a major accomplishment for the administration and a priority for President Trump. He explained that the goal is to create a more accountable, efficient, and effective government by soliciting input from outside sources and restructuring agencies based on their functions. Mulvaney stated that the government hiring freeze will be replaced with a smarter approach, where certain agencies will be allowed to hire more people and others will have to reduce their workforce. The guidance for the reorganization will be released in the morning, and agencies will have until June to provide their ideas for improvement. The final plan is expected to be put into place in approximately 11 months. Mulvaney also addressed concerns about the potential negative impact on local economies and assured that the administration is focused on rewarding good employees and providing better value for taxpayers. He mentioned that the reorganization may involve reducing the number of regional offices, but the specific details will depend on each agency's recommendations. Mulvaney acknowledged that some changes may require congressional approval, and the administration hopes to get congressional buy-in for the reform efforts. Overall, the administration aims to achieve good government and drain the swamp by restructuring the executive branch.
