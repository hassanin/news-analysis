The United States rejects the "referendum" that took place in Crimea, as it goes against Ukraine's constitution and was administered under threats of violence and intimidation. The international community will not recognize the results. The Ukrainian government has expressed its willingness to discuss increased autonomy for Crimea, and the upcoming presidential elections provide a legitimate opportunity for all Ukrainians to voice their opinions. The US, along with other countries and organizations, has called for international monitors to ensure the rights of ethnic Russians in Ukraine are upheld. Russia has disregarded these calls and has escalated its military intervention in Crimea and initiated threatening military exercises on Ukraine's eastern border. The UN Security Council, excluding Russia, recognized Russia's actions as dangerous and destabilizing. Military intervention and violation of international law will bring increasing costs for Russia. The international community is urged to condemn such actions, impose costs, and support the Ukrainian people and Ukraine's territorial integrity.
