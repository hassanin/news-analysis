This event is part of the "In Performance at the White House" series and the Joining Forces initiative. It will take place on November 6 and will celebrate the men and women who serve the United States. The event will feature performances by music legends such as Mary J. Blige, Common, John Fogerty, Willie Nelson, and Romeo Santos. There will also be performances by active duty military members and the rock band Daughtry via satellite. The President's remarks will be streamed live on WhiteHouse.gov. The event will be broadcast on PBS stations on November 7 as part of the PBS Arts Fall Festival. It will also be broadcast on Veterans Day via the American Forces Network. In addition to the concert, there will be a workshop for high school students from military communities, exploring the history of music and the military. This event is the thirteenth "In Performance at the White House" program during President Barack Obama's administration. The event is organized as part of the Joining Forces initiative, which supports service members, veterans, and their families through wellness, education, and employment opportunities.
