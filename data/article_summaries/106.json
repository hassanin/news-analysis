Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the Department of Education to announce the cancellation of all remaining federal student loans for former Corinthian College students. The for-profit college was found to have engaged in false and deceptive advertising, targeting vulnerable populations and providing worthless degrees. The Department of Education will automatically cancel the loans for over half a million former students, providing nearly $6 billion in debt relief. Harris thanked advocates and members of Congress for their fight on behalf of the defrauded students and emphasized the importance of holding bad actors accountable and providing relief to those harmed.
