In this article, President Barack Obama declares November 9, 2016, as World Freedom Day to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Berlin Wall, which stood for nearly 30 years, separated families and symbolized the authoritarianism of Communist states during the Cold War. The collapse of the wall in 1989 represented a triumph of unity over division. The president emphasizes the ongoing work needed to promote democracy and liberty around the world, and recognizes the progress that has been made in terms of human rights and free elections. However, he also acknowledges that the fight for freedom is ongoing and that it is up to each individual to continue working towards a better future. President Obama calls upon the people of the United States to observe World Freedom Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming their dedication to freedom and democracy.
