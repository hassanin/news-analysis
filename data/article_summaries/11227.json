Amelia Boynton Robinson, a dedicated and courageous leader in the fight for civil rights, passed away. She spent most of her 104 years advocating for the right to vote for everyone. Fifty years ago, she marched in Selma, which played a significant role in the passing of the Voting Rights Act. Throughout her life, she continued to fight for the enforcement of this law and the removal of barriers to voting. The President urges everyone to honor her legacy by following her example and fighting to protect the right to vote for all. The President and First Lady had the privilege of walking with Amelia in Selma earlier this year, and they remember her as a strong, hopeful, and indomitable spirit. They extend their condolences and gratitude to all who loved her.
