In the case of Washington v. Trump, the Ninth Circuit released three dissenting opinions. Judges Jay Bybee, Alex Kozinski, and Carlos Bea authored these dissents. At least four judges, including the authors of the dissents and Judges Consuelo Callahan and Sandra Ikuta, joined each of the three dissenting opinions. 

Judge Bybee emphasized the principle of judicial restraint in the areas of immigration and national security policy. 

Judge Kozinski criticized the Court's reliance on due process, arguing that very few foreign nationals affected by the President's executive order had any due process rights under the law. He also criticized the Court's unwillingness to only restrain the unconstitutional portions of the order.

Both Judge Kozinski and Judge Bybee faulted the Court for misapplying the Establishment Clause.

Lastly, Judge Bea criticized the Court for granting the States standing to file the case in the first place.
