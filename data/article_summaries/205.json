President Biden is announcing $16.4 billion for passenger rail projects as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. However, House Republicans are proposing an appropriations bill that significantly reduces funding for Amtrak and other transportation and infrastructure programs. The President has stated that he would veto this bill, as it would undermine American infrastructure and add to the deficit. This is not the first time House Republicans have attempted to cut infrastructure investments. Instead, they should work on a bipartisan funding agreement and address urgent national security and domestic needs. Additionally, the bill also includes cuts to housing programs.
