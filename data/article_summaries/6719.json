Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland and Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice led the second meeting of the White House Council on Native American Affairs (WHCNAA). They were joined by eleven Cabinet Secretaries and senior administration officials to discuss strengthening the government-to-government relationship with Tribal Nations and promoting self-determination and self-government. The meeting focused on supporting Tribal Nations' use of federal funding dedicated to their needs, particularly in response to COVID-19. The WHCNAA Health Committee also announced plans to host a dialogue on COVID-19 and improving health systems in Indian Country, providing an opportunity for Tribal engagement and sharing of data. The Council will continue to work on various key issues, including climate change, Tribal homelands and treaties, economic development, energy and infrastructure, health, education, public safety and justice, and international Indigenous issues.
