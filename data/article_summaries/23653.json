On July 11, 2011, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13579, titled "Regulation and Independent Regulatory Agencies," in order to improve regulation and regulatory review. The order emphasizes the importance of public participation and careful analysis of the consequences of regulation in making wise regulatory decisions. It states that decisions should be made after considering both the costs and benefits of regulation. The order also highlights the need for independent regulatory agencies to promote the goal of protecting public health, welfare, safety, and the environment while promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.

Furthermore, the order directs independent regulatory agencies to comply with the general requirements set out in Executive Order 13563, which pertains to executive agencies. These requirements include provisions regarding public participation, integration and innovation, flexible approaches, and science.

The order also calls for the periodic review of existing significant regulations by independent regulatory agencies. It encourages agencies to conduct retrospective analyses of rules that may be outdated, ineffective, insufficient, or overly burdensome, and to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal them based on what has been learned. These analyses and associated data and evaluations should be made available online whenever possible.

The order includes general provisions, such as definitions of "executive agency" and "independent regulatory agency," and clarifies that it does not impair existing authorities or functions of relevant departments, agencies, or the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also states that the order is subject to applicable law and available appropriations.

Lastly, the order emphasizes that it does not create any rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities.
