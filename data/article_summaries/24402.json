Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko about the situation in the east of Ukraine and the Ukrainian government's efforts to improve its economy. President Poroshenko informed the Vice President about ongoing shelling by Russia-backed separatists in Donetsk and Mariupol, which has resulted in more casualties among Ukrainian service members. The two leaders also discussed the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) inability to confirm Russia's withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front lines. The Vice President expressed his support for Ukraine's plan to pass critical reform legislation and praised the country's ambitious program of reforms developed in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These reforms are expected to stabilize the economy and facilitate the disbursement of significant international financing in the near future.
