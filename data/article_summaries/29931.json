President Trump has urged Congress to pass legislation to put an end to surprise medical bills. He first called for this in May 2019 when he released principles for surprise billing legislation. In September, he signed an Executive Order urging Congress to take action by the end of the year. Congress is now being urged to quickly pass a compromise bill that would protect patients from surprise medical and air ambulance bills.
