This article discusses the deportation of Jakiw Palij, a former Nazi SS labor camp guard, from the United States to Germany. The deportation was carried out by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after a court ordered Palij's removal in 2004. Previous administrations had been unsuccessful in removing him. President Trump commended ICE's actions in removing this war criminal from US soil. Palij had lied about his Nazi past and remained in the US for decades. The deportation sends a message that the US will not tolerate those who facilitated Nazi crimes and human rights violations. Palij trained at the Nazi SS Training Camp in Trawniki and served as an armed guard at the Trawniki Labor Camp, where a large number of Jewish prisoners were killed during the Holocaust. Palij's US citizenship was revoked in 2003, and he was ordered deported in 2004. The article also highlights the US government's efforts to identify, prosecute, and deport Nazi war criminals.
