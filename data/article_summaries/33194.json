The President commends the House of Representatives for passing the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017. This act aims to expand access to experimental treatments for patients with life-threatening illnesses by creating an alternative pathway within the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The President had expressed support for this legislation in his State of the Union Address and believes that patients, with the guidance of their physicians, should have the right to make treatment decisions. Many states have already passed similar legislation, and the Administration plans to address this issue at the Federal level. The Administration is committed to implementing patient-centered healthcare policies and ensuring that Americans have access to the healthcare options they need.
