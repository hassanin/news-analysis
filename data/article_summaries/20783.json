President Obama has proclaimed August 16-22, 2015, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. During this week, Americans are encouraged to thank the members of the National Guard and Reserve, as well as their civilian employers. The proclamation acknowledges the sacrifices made by these citizen-warriors and their families, and emphasizes the importance of providing support and benefits to those who serve. The Joining Forces initiative, led by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden, aims to encourage communities and business leaders to provide workplace flexibility and advancement opportunities for members of the Guard and Reserve. The proclamation calls on all Americans, as well as state and local officials, private organizations, and military commanders, to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
