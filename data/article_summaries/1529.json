The article discusses the continuation of a national emergency declaration by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world. The declaration was initially made in December 2017 through Executive Order 13818. The President states that the prevalence and severity of these issues originating outside the United States still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the country. As a result, the national emergency declaration is extended for another year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
