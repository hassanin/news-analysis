The article highlights the historic jobs recovery powered by the American Rescue Plan (ARP), which has led to the largest calendar increase in jobs on record. Unemployment has also decreased to 3.8%, with significant drops in Hispanic Unemployment and Youth Unemployment. The recovery has been less damaging than previous ones. The ARP aims to lower healthcare costs and increase health coverage, invest in mental health, fight COVID, and get kids back in school. It also focuses on supporting working families, helping people get back to work, and staying true to veterans. The plan includes efforts to rescue and transform communities, as well as providing permanent tax relief for Puerto Rico families. Additionally, it emphasizes strong support for tribal communities.
