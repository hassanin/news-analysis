President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536 of April 12, 2010, with respect to Somalia, is to continue beyond April 12, 2016. Despite progress made in stabilizing Somalia, the importance of U.S. sanctions against individuals and entities that have threatened peace, security, or stability in Somalia remains. This includes those involved in acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, as well as those in violation of the United Nations Security Council arms embargo. Therefore, the national emergency with respect to Somalia will continue, along with the sanctions in place to address this threat.
