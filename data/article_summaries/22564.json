President Obama has made a commitment to expand college opportunities for all Americans. The President and First Lady have brought together college and university presidents, business and philanthropic leaders, and other stakeholders to announce over 100 new commitments to expand college opportunity. The commitments focus on four key areas: connecting more low-income students to the right schools, increasing the pool of students preparing for college, leveling the playing field in college advising and test preparation, and seeing breakthroughs in remedial education. The President has also pledged to take executive action to increase transparency and accountability in higher education.
