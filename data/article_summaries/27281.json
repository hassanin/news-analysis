President Donald J. Trump has issued a notice stating that the national emergency declared with respect to the situation in Syria will continue beyond October 14, 2020. The decision was made due to the actions of the Government of Turkey conducting a military offensive in northeast Syria, which undermines the campaign against ISIS, endangers civilians, threatens peace and stability in the region, and poses a threat to US national security and foreign policy. Therefore, President Trump has determined it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894.
