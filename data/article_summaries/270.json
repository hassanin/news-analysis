Today, as part of Black Maternal Health Week, senior White House officials convened state legislators from across the country to discuss legislation aimed at improving maternal health. The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized improving maternal health and has released a Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis, which outlines strategies to combat maternal mortality and morbidity. The President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2024 includes $471 million to support the implementation of the Blueprint and requires all states to provide continuous Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum. The Department of Health and Human Services also announced the availability of $468 million in funding for maternal and child health initiatives. Over 30 states and the District of Columbia have implemented or will implement a 12-month extension of Medicaid postpartum coverage. Legislators are also working on bills to expand access to midwives and doulas, improve maternal mental health, and provide workplace protections for pregnant women and mothers. The White House officials thanked the legislators for their leadership and affirmed the Administration's support in addressing the maternal health crisis.
