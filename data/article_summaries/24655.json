The United Nations has declared that famine is affecting five regions in Somalia due to the worst drought in East Africa in 60 years. The famine is expected to spread throughout southern Somalia, causing thousands of Somalis to seek refuge in Kenya and Ethiopia, which are also affected by the drought. The United Nations estimates that over 12.4 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. In response, the U.S. President has approved an additional $105 million in humanitarian relief funds for the Horn of Africa, bringing the total U.S. assistance this year to approximately $565 million. This funding will be used to provide food, health, shelter, water, and sanitation assistance to those in need.
