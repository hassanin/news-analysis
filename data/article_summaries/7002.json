The White House virtually convened government officials and industry leaders to discuss the historically low water levels along the Mississippi River. The meeting included representatives from various departments and agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The extreme drought in the Mississippi River basin has led to extremely low water levels, with little rain in the forecast. CEOs provided an overview of the industries, commodities, and jobs that rely on the river, and both sides discussed the impacts of low water levels on barge transportation and the movement of agricultural and energy goods. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Coast Guard are working to maintain safe navigation through dredging river channels, implementing safety limitations, and maintaining navigational signals. Agricultural shippers have support available through the USDA, including the ability to license emergency and temporary storage space. The participants also discussed how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including the recent announcement of $703 million in Port Infrastructure Development Program awards, will improve the resilience and capacity of the nation's waterways. The meeting concluded with a commitment to continue coordination and communication to ensure the smooth functioning of the Mississippi River system and minimize disruptions to commerce.
