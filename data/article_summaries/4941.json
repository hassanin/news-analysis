The article discusses President Biden's decision to extend the national emergency declaration with respect to the Western Balkans. Under Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice stating that it will continue beyond the anniversary date. President Biden has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency, initially declared in 2001 and expanded in 2021, will continue beyond June 26, 2023. The declaration is based on the ongoing acts of extremist violence, obstructionist activity, and the situation in the Western Balkans, which pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
