The U.S. economy showed strong signs of growth in February 2018, with nonfarm payroll employment increasing by 313,000. This, along with strong job growth in January, means that 2018 has registered the strongest average monthly job growth since 1997. The report suggests that the President's pro-growth policy agenda is leading to increased employment opportunities. Job gains were seen in every sector except information, with goods-producing industries experiencing the biggest increase since 1998. Average hourly earnings for private sector employees increased by 4 cents in February, resulting in a 2.6% increase over the year. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1%, the lowest rate since 2000, with declines seen in specific demographic groups. The labor force participation rate and the employment-population ratio both increased.
