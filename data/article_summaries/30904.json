President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation recognizing National Maritime Day. The proclamation highlights the important role of the United States Merchant Marine in delivering goods, facilitating commerce, and protecting national security. It also pays tribute to the merchant mariners who served during World War II, acknowledging their sacrifices and awarding them the Congressional Gold Medal. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to observe National Maritime Day by displaying the flag and requests that ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
