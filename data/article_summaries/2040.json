At the G20 Summit, President Joko Widodo of Indonesia and leaders of the International Partners Group (IPG) launched a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) to support a sustainable power sector transition in Indonesia. The partnership aims to mobilize $20 billion in public and private financing over the next three to five years. The funds will be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, develop renewable energy sources, and support impacted communities. The partnership expects to shift Indonesia's power sector peaking date forward by approximately seven years and achieve a cumulative reduction of more than 300 megatons in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The Parties will work together to develop a concrete plan for investments, financing, and technical assistance over the next six months. The partnership received support from international leaders such as U.S. President Biden, Japan's Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, and the leaders of Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, and the United Kingdom.
