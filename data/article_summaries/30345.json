First Lady Melania Trump announced her upcoming visit to Africa during a reception for delegates to the United Nations General Assembly. This will be her first major solo international trip. She will be visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt. The trip will focus on maternal and newborn care, education for children, the culture and history of each country, and the United States' support for self-reliance in these countries. The First Lady's Office is working closely with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to plan the visits. Press opportunities will be available during the trip, and additional outlets can sign up to cover specific events or countries. Melania Trump's Be Best campaign aims to support and help children around the world.
