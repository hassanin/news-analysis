The article discusses the signing of the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) and NATO Status of Forces Agreement in Afghanistan. The BSA strengthens the U.S.-Afghan partnership and provides a legal framework for the U.S. military to target Al Qaeda remnants and assist Afghan National Security Forces. The agreement reflects the implementation of the Strategic Partnership Agreement signed in 2012. The NATO Status of Forces Agreement gives legal protections to forces from Allied and partner countries for the NATO Resolute Support mission. These agreements follow the historic Afghan election and aim to support the new Afghan Unity Government and defeat Al Qaeda. The article also acknowledges the sacrifices made by American service members in Afghanistan.
