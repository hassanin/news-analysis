The Precision Medicine Initiative is a research effort launched by the Obama administration to revolutionize healthcare and improve treatment for diseases. It aims to move away from the "one-size-fits-all" approach to medicine and take into account individual differences in genes, environments, and lifestyles. Precision medicine uses tools to better understand a patient's health and disease, and predict which treatments will be most effective. The initiative will leverage advances in genomics, data analysis, and health information technology to accelerate biomedical discoveries. It also aims to engage a million or more Americans to contribute their health data to improve outcomes and develop new treatments. The initiative will receive a $215 million investment from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). The funding will support the development of a national research cohort, scale up efforts in cancer research, acquire expertise for precision medicine innovation, and support the development of interoperability standards and requirements for data exchange. The objectives of the initiative include developing better treatments for cancer, creating a voluntary national research cohort, protecting privacy, and modernizing regulations. Public-private partnerships will be formed to expand cancer genomics and launch the research cohort. The initiative aims to empower individuals and families to invest in and manage their health by giving them access to their own health data and related applications and services.
