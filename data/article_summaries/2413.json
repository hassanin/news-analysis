Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building about the importance of high-speed internet access. She emphasized that in the 21st century, high-speed internet is a necessity, not a luxury. During the pandemic, millions of people relied on the internet for various needs such as education, work, healthcare, and daily essentials. However, more than 42 million people in the U.S. still do not have access to high-speed internet, primarily due to the cost. To address this issue, the Biden administration passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which invested over $14 billion to make high-speed internet more affordable. They also created the Affordable Connectivity Program, which offers discounts on monthly internet bills and provides a one-time discount for purchasing devices. Already, over 10 million American households have signed up for the program. The Vice President encouraged eligible individuals to visit ACPBenefit.gov to confirm their eligibility and sign up for benefits. She also called on internet service providers to participate in the program and spread the word to eligible households. The Vice President emphasized that providing affordable high-speed internet connects families and workers to opportunities, enabling them to live more prosperous lives. She thanked the leaders and organizations working on this issue and expressed gratitude for their efforts in giving Americans a fair shot at a better future.
