Karen Pence, the Second Lady, visited the art therapy program at Dell's Children's Medical Center of Central Texas in Austin. Elizabeth Hendley, the art therapist at the hospital, has been helping children relieve stress through art therapy for 10 years. Hendley shared stories of children benefiting from art therapy, including one child whose high blood pressure dropped significantly while working on art projects. Dell's Children's Medical Center recognizes the benefits of art therapy and has a healing gallery displaying patients' artwork. Pence observed Hendley working with a 6-year-old girl who had recently had a brain tumor removed, and saw how the girl smiled while doing art therapy. Pence thanked Hendley and the hospital for their efforts in bringing the healing benefits of art therapy to young patients.
