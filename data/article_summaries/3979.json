President Biden has declared a major disaster in Montana due to flooding that occurred from April 10 to April 26, 2023. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, as well as the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Blaine, Daniels, Hill, Park, Roosevelt, Sheridan, and Valley, as well as the Fort Peck Tribes, are included in the declaration. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Jon Huss of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
