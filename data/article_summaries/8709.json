President Biden has declared a state of emergency in New York due to the conditions resulting from Tropical Storm Henri. This declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to save lives and protect property and public health. FEMA is authorized to mobilize equipment and resources as needed to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures, including mass care support, will be funded at 75 percent by the federal government. Lai Sun Yee has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
