The White House plans to commit $220 million in new assistance to Ukraine this year in support of economic, political, and energy reforms. This assistance package will continue to support Ukraine's efforts in strengthening democratic institutions, sustainable economic growth, and responding to humanitarian needs. The assistance will also support key areas of Prime Minister Groysman's reform agenda, including customs reform, fighting corruption, decentralization, and energy security. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has also approved $62.5 million in financial support to two private equity funds that will invest in Ukraine. The United States is also helping Ukraine improve its business environment to attract more foreign investment. Since 2014, the U.S. government has committed over $1.3 billion in foreign assistance to Ukraine, including humanitarian assistance and loan guarantees.
