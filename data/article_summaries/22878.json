The article is a press gaggle by Jay Carney, the White House Press Secretary, during a trip to Manchester, New Hampshire. Carney discusses President Obama's speech on the American Jobs Act and the need for Congress to pass the provision within the Act that would extend and expand the payroll tax cut. He emphasizes that if Congress does not act, 160 million Americans will see their taxes go up by $1,000 next year. Carney also mentions that the President's plan would provide a $1,500 tax cut for the average American family next year and a tax cut for businesses that hire new employees or expand their payroll. Carney is asked about the President's calls to members of the super committee, the President's strategy for the payroll tax cut extension, and the trial of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi. He also comments on Mitt Romney's television ads and the possibility of a downgrade in S&P ratings. Carney expresses concern about the violence in Egypt and the need for elections to go forward. He concludes by discussing the sequester and the President's veto threat if Congress does not act to avoid it.
