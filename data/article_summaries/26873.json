President Donald J. Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism will continue beyond September 23, 2017. The national emergency was originally declared in Executive Order 13224 on September 23, 2001, in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. President Trump believes that the crisis of terrorism and the threat of further attacks still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency for one more year.
