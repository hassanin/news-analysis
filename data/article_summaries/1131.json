The article discusses the economic recovery of Main Street businesses under President Biden and Vice President Harris. It highlights that in 2021, a record number of Americans applied to start new businesses, with a significant increase in entrepreneurship among people of color. Small businesses with fewer than 50 employees also created a large number of jobs, the fastest growth in any year on record. The article attributes this success to the Biden-Harris administration's focus on combating the pandemic, providing financial security, and delivering emergency relief to small businesses.

The article also criticizes the tax plan proposed by Congressional Republicans, particularly Senator Rick Scott's proposal to impose a minimum tax on middle-class families. It argues that this plan would increase taxes on small businesses across the country, with nearly half of small business owners, including 82 percent of those making less than $50,000 per year, facing higher taxes. President Biden rejects this plan and instead proposes a four-pillar economic strategy for small businesses, which includes expanding access to capital, helping small businesses navigate available resources, leveraging federal spending, and reforming the tax code to level the playing field for small business owners.
