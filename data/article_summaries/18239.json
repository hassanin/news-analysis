President Obama will host Prime Minister Petr Necas of the Czech Republic for a meeting in the Oval Office. The two leaders will discuss preparations for the 2012 NATO Summit, bilateral economic and commercial relations, and cooperation on promoting democracy, good governance, and human rights. The meeting is a way for President Obama to reciprocate the warm hospitality he received during his visits to Prague in 2009 and 2010.
