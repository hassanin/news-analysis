On International Day of the Girl, the White House Gender Policy Council, Domestic Policy Council, and the Department of Education held a roundtable discussion with youth survivors of online harassment and abuse, as well as educators, advocates, and health experts. The discussion highlighted the increased screen time among teens and tweens, which has led to a rise in online harms, particularly affecting girls. Online harassment disproportionately impacts girls, with half of girls reporting that they are more likely to be harassed through social media than on the street. The participants shared their experiences of online harassment and abuse, emphasizing the impact on mental and physical health. They also highlighted the disproportionate effects on adolescent girls, youth of color, and LGBTQI+ youth. Recommendations were provided to address online harassment and abuse, including ensuring access to support services and improving safety in the design of tech products. Administration officials reaffirmed their commitment to addressing online harassment and abuse through the Task Force and the Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse. The Task Force will produce recommendations and guidance to tackle this pervasive challenge.
