The White House recently held a convening to discuss expanding the purchase of lower-carbon materials made by American workers. This is part of President Biden's Federal Buy Clean Initiative, which aims to advance low-carbon construction materials in federal procurement and funded infrastructure projects. The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new public and private sector commitments aligned with this initiative. The administration is leveraging the government's purchasing power to catalyze markets and support American manufacturing. Partnerships between different leaders, including state, tribal, regional, local, and industry leaders, are crucial to ensuring that these investments benefit all Americans. The administration's actions include prioritizing the purchase of steel, concrete, asphalt, and flat glass with lower embodied emissions. These materials account for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. manufacturing. The private sector is also making commitments to invest in and scale up the production of lower-carbon materials. Design, architecture, and engineering firms are integrating cleaner materials into their project designs, and major corporate purchasers are demanding these materials. The goal is to create more clean manufacturing jobs and achieve net-zero emissions.
