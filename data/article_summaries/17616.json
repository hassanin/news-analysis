In this press gaggle, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, along with Dan Pfeiffer, the President’s Director of Communications, and Bob Bauer, the President’s White House Counsel, discuss the release of President Obama's long-form birth certificate from the state of Hawaii. They explain that in 2008, during the President's campaign, his birth certificate was requested from the state of Hawaii and posted online. Independent fact checkers inspected the document and confirmed that it was proof of the President's birth in Hawaii. However, the issue resurfaced recently, distracting from important national issues. The President decided to release the long-form birth certificate in order to put the issue to rest. The press also asks questions about the document and the process of obtaining it. The press gaggle ends with questions about other topics, such as the Defense of Marriage Act and the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
