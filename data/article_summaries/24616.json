The White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, highlights three recent developments in addressing the urgent humanitarian situation on the southwest border. First, Deputy Attorney General Jim Cole is visiting the border and discussing the shifting of additional resources from the interior of the country to the border. Second, the government of Mexico has announced the opening of five new border control centers to tighten security and monitor border activity. Third, Vice President Joe Biden has made phone calls to the presidents of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to collaborate on stemming the flow of illegal migration at its source. The President is planning to meet with state and local officials in Dallas to discuss the immigration issue. Governor Perry will be present at the meeting, and the President will convene a roundtable meeting with local elected officials and faith leaders. The President is determined to put aside partisan politics and focus on solutions. The administration is calling on Congress to act with urgency and provide the necessary resources to address the situation at the border. There are concerns that the supplemental request could be delayed or derailed by ideological amendments. The administration is considering opening additional detention facilities and implementing alternatives to detention, such as ankle bracelets, to more efficiently process the cases of those apprehended at the border. The President's team is well aware of the situation at the border and is actively working to address the problem. The relationship between the United States and Germany remains strong despite recent reports of spying. The administration is hopeful that Congress will support the supplemental request and take action to meet the urgent need at the border. The President is motivated by the need to find solutions to the humanitarian situation and is willing to work with Democrats and Republicans who share his interests in addressing the issue.
