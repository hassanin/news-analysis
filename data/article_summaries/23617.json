The joint statement between the United States and Brazil on climate change highlights their commitment to collaborating and addressing the challenges posed by climate change. They emphasize the need for a successful outcome at the Paris Climate Change Conference, which should send a strong signal that governments, businesses, and civil society are taking decisive action on climate change. The statement also emphasizes the importance of strong nationally determined contributions, regular updating, and longer-term strategies for transitioning to low-carbon economies. Both countries have made significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with Brazil reducing emissions by around 41% since 2005 and the United States reducing emissions by around 10% on track to meet its 2020 target. The statement also outlines specific actions and initiatives that the two countries will undertake, including cooperation on sustainable land use, clean energy, and adaptation to climate change. They will work together to promote actions on forests, agriculture, and land use, increase the share of renewables in their electricity generation mixes, and build resilience to climate change impacts in areas such as biodiversity, infrastructure, agricultural production, and water resources.
