This presidential memorandum, issued on June 26, 2019, addresses the policy for military service academy and Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) graduates seeking to participate in professional sports. Currently, these graduates are required to serve 2 years of commissioned service in the Armed Forces before pursuing careers in professional sports. However, President Trump believes that these student-athletes should be able to defer their military service obligations until after their professional sports careers. The memorandum orders the Secretary of Defense to develop a policy that allows graduates to pursue professional sports opportunities immediately following graduation, while still fulfilling their military service obligation. The revised policy aims to benefit the student-athletes, the academies and ROTC programs, and the Armed Forces. The memorandum also includes general provisions and instructions for implementation.
