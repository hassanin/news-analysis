The Biden-Harris Administration has launched the Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Sprint as part of its Investing in America agenda. This initiative aims to build a diverse and skilled pipeline of workers for good jobs in advanced manufacturing, including union jobs. The sprint brings together employers, unions, education and training providers, community-based groups, and others to help Americans train for and succeed in this growing field. President Biden and senior Administration officials will travel across the country to highlight the impact of the Bidenomics agenda and celebrate the launch of the sprint. The Advanced Manufacturing Sprint will continue through the end of 2023, and interested organizations are invited to join. The White House has already made significant investments in training students and workers for advanced manufacturing jobs, many of which do not require a four-year college degree. The convening also highlights existing efforts to ensure workforce development programs meet the needs of workers and employers. The Biden-Harris Advanced Manufacturing Sprint builds on previous workforce sprints focused on equitable workforce development and job quality improvement in various industries.
