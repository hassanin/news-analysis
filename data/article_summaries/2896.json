The White House recently held a roundtable discussion on the data broker industry's monetization of personal information and the actions being taken to protect American consumers. The session, hosted by several government agencies, aimed to address the harms caused by data brokers and find ways to regulate and oversee their practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) also announced plans to propose rules that would ensure data companies comply with the law, restrict the sale of certain data, limit the disclosure of sensitive contact information, and give consumers the right to access and dispute their data. During the discussion, participants highlighted concerns such as the secretive collection and sale of sensitive data, data-driven scoring that leads to discrimination against minority communities, scams targeting vulnerable individuals, and inadequate oversight of data brokers. They also discussed how data brokers acquire detailed data without consent, the use of artificial intelligence to infer personal information, and the various parties to whom brokers sell data, including advertisers, financial institutions, employers, landlords, and fraudsters. Participants shared stories of individuals facing credit and housing application denials due to inaccurate or inappropriate data. The discussion also emphasized how the data broker economy enables discriminatory practices in areas like credit, insurance, housing, employment, and advertising, disproportionately affecting underserved and vulnerable groups. Additionally, participants highlighted instances where geolocation data sold by brokers was used to harass women and hinder their access to healthcare.
