The United States has welcomed the decision by Saudi Arabia and the Saudi-led coalition to reopen the Hudaydah port and Sanaa International Airport in Yemen. This move will allow the urgent flow of humanitarian aid to reach the people of Yemen. The United States emphasizes the need for the full and immediate implementation of these measures to ensure that food, medicine, and fuel reach those in need. The US also calls for additional steps to facilitate the unrestricted flow of humanitarian and commercial goods to all ports of entry in Yemen. The US stresses that all parties involved in the conflict should prioritize assistance to those in need and support a political process that facilitates humanitarian relief.
