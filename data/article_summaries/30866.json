Senator Tim Scott discusses the Investing In Opportunity Act (IIOA) in an op-ed published in USA Today. The IIOA, included in last year's tax reform package, aims to direct trillions in capital gains to distressed communities across the United States. The senator believes that public-private partnerships, rather than taxpayer-funded government programs, are the solution to spreading opportunity and revitalizing these communities. Under the IIOA, investors can receive a lower capital gains rate in exchange for long-term investment, which will stimulate job growth, entrepreneurship, and local economic improvement. Governors and local leaders will have the opportunity to designate "Opportunity Zones," ensuring that the most disadvantaged areas benefit from the initiative. The senator highlights the enthusiasm from mayors, state development offices, and community development groups to participate in this program. The op-ed concludes with a call to capitalize on private-sector resources to create a brighter future for marginalized communities.
