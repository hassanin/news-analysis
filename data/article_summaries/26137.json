He mentioned that he will be discussing the DNI appointment further in the coming days.

The President also discussed various other issues during the press conference, such as his views on China, the ongoing negotiations with the Taliban, the INF nuclear treaty, trade with the European Union, and the situation at the southern border. He reiterated his commitment to helping farmers affected by the trade war with China and stated that any tariffs imposed on Chinese products would be paid for by China through devaluation of their currency and other financial measures.
