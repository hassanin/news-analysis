President Biden has announced the launch of the Digital Transformation with Africa (DTA) initiative, which aims to expand digital access and literacy in Africa. The initiative plans to invest over $350 million and facilitate over $450 million in financing for Africa, in line with the African Union's Digital Transformation Strategy and the U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa. The DTA initiative aims to leverage Africa's digital ecosystem to promote economic recovery, social equality, gender equality, and job creation. It also seeks to deepen partnerships between African governments, the U.S. private sector, educational institutions, and the African diaspora. The initiative will focus on three core pillars: digital economy and infrastructure, human capital development, and digital enabling environment. The DTA initiative is a whole-of-government effort that involves various departments and agencies of the U.S. Government.
