The Presidents of the United States and Russia, Joseph R. Biden and Vladimir Putin, acknowledge that their countries have been able to make progress in achieving common goals even during times of tension. They highlight the recent extension of the New START Treaty as an example of their commitment to nuclear arms control. They emphasize the principle that a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought. In line with these objectives, the two countries will soon initiate a bilateral Strategic Stability Dialogue to establish a foundation for future arms control and risk reduction measures.
