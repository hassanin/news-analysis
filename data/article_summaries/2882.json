The White House and White House Council on Native American Affairs (WHCNAA) recently held a meeting to discuss the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is a significant piece of clean energy and climate legislation. The meeting involved Tribal leaders and cabinet officials, who discussed programs aimed at providing affordable and clean electricity to Tribal households, increasing resilience to climate change, and supporting the transition to cleaner sources of energy in Native communities. The meeting also highlighted the Inflation Reduction Act Tribal Guidebook, a resource created by the Biden-Harris Administration to assist Tribal communities in identifying programs and funding opportunities. This engagement session is part of a series of sessions organized by the White House Council on Native American Affairs to address various issues affecting Tribal communities.
