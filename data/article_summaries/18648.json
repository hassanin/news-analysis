The White House has released a fact sheet addressing the increasing threat of wildfires in the United States. In 2015, there were over 68,000 wildfires that burned more than 10 million acres and destroyed over 4,600 structures, the highest number of acres burned on record. Climate change, including increased warming, drought, and insect outbreaks, has contributed to the rise in wildfires, especially in the western U.S. The fact sheet emphasizes the need to increase understanding of how wildfires interact with communities and to enhance community resilience. The White House has signed an Executive Order on Wildland-Urban Interface Federal Risk Mitigation, which requires federal agencies to apply wildfire-resistant design provisions for new and altered buildings in high-risk areas. Federal, state, local, tribal, and non-governmental leaders have also committed to a collaborative approach to address the challenges posed by wildfires. The fact sheet highlights the broader efforts to build resilience throughout the federal government and with other partners, including initiatives on flood risk management, drought resilience, and advocating for climate-smart building codes.
