The Biden administration is taking new actions to increase access to COVID-19 treatments and raise awareness among patients and healthcare providers. One of the most effective treatments available is Pfizer's oral antiviral pill, Paxlovid, which has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by about 90 percent. The administration has worked with Pfizer to accelerate the delivery of these pills, which are now widely available. The administration is also working to expand the availability of oral antivirals by allowing all pharmacy partners in the federal antiviral pharmacy program to order them directly from the federal government. They expect oral antivirals to be available in over 30,000 locations in the coming weeks. The administration is also launching a new effort to establish federally supported Test to Treat sites, where people can get a COVID-19 test, a visit with a medical provider, and, if needed, free oral antiviral pills all in one visit. They will be working with states and jurisdictions to establish these sites. The administration will also provide more guidance and tools to healthcare providers to help them understand and prescribe treatment. They will ramp up public awareness and education efforts to ensure that people know about the availability and benefits of COVID-19 treatments. The administration is requesting additional funding from Congress to secure the essential needs for future treatments.
