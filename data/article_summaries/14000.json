The Departments of Defense and State have released a joint final report to Congress on the national security importance of revising U.S. export controls on satellites and related items. The report highlights that compared to the United States, other nations have fewer export controls on commercial space and space-related items. Over the past 15 years, many commercial satellite systems and technologies have become less critical to national security. As a result, the report recommends that U.S. export controls reflect this decreased sensitivity while still preventing significant improvement of military capabilities in other countries. The report also suggests that exports of space-related items to allies and close partners should be subject to fewer restrictions. However, the report emphasizes the need for strict controls on transfers of non-critical space-related items to end users and for end uses that could be detrimental to U.S. national interests. The report recommends maintaining special export controls on certain services and components to mitigate risks associated with satellite failures, launch services, and launch failure analysis. The report proposes that removing certain space-related dual-use items from the United States Munitions List (USML) could be acceptably managed through controls and licensing policies under the Commerce Control List (CCL) administered by the Department of Commerce. The report concludes that implementing these recommendations would prioritize U.S. export controls for satellites and related items, synchronize licensing policies, improve the U.S. satellite industry's competitiveness, and strengthen supplier relationships with foreign customers in allied and partner countries. The Administration is committed to working with Congress to ensure that U.S. export controls meet current and future national security requirements.
