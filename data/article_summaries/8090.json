On December 13, 2022, the President signed H.R. 8404, the "Respect for Marriage Act," into law. This act establishes statutory authority for same-sex and interracial marriages and repeals provisions of law that previously prevented states and territories from being required to recognize same-sex marriages from other states or territories. The President expressed gratitude to Speaker Pelosi, Representatives Nadler, Cicilline, and Davids, Leader Schumer, Senators Baldwin, Collins, Portman, Sinema, Tillis, Feinstein, and Booker, and many others for their leadership in passing this legislation.
