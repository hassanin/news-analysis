This week, there were several developments that highlighted the American manufacturing boom under President Biden's economic agenda. Air India's $34 billion order for 220 Boeing planes was described by President Biden as a "historic" deal that would support one million US jobs and promote technological leadership. These jobs would be spread across 44 states and many would not require a four-year college degree. Ford Motor Co. also announced plans to build a $3.5 billion battery factory in Michigan, which would employ at least 2,500 people and produce batteries for 400,000 vehicles per year. Additionally, Texas Instruments revealed its intention to build a second semiconductor wafer fabrication plant in Utah, creating around 800 new jobs and potentially thousands of indirect jobs. These investments are expected to revitalize communities, provide good-paying jobs, and position the United States as a leader in future industries.
