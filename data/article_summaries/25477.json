President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed August 19 through August 25, 2018, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. The proclamation recognizes the importance of the employers and communities that support the National Guard and Reserve, as nearly half of the nation's Armed Forces are comprised of these members. The proclamation expresses gratitude to the employers who provide flexibility and support to Guardsmen and Reservists, allowing them to make valuable contributions to the military. It also calls on Americans to support the brave Guardsmen, Reservists, and their families, acknowledging the sacrifices they make to secure and maintain freedom. The proclamation encourages State and local officials, private organizations, and military commanders to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
