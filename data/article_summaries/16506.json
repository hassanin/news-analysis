The President of the United States spoke with Afghan presidential candidates Dr. Ashraf Ghani and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah to call for calm and emphasize the need for political dialogue as the election results are tabulated. The President stressed the importance of a thorough review of fraud allegations to ensure a credible electoral process. He urged all parties to avoid actions that undermine national unity and work towards a resolution that represents the will of the Afghan people. The President also emphasized that resorting to violence or extra-constitutional means would result in the end of U.S. assistance to Afghanistan. Secretary Kerry will continue to consult with the candidates and President Karzai in the coming days.
