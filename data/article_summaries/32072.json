The Trump Administration has announced over $1 billion in awards for the establishment of 12 new research and development institutes focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum information science (QIS). These institutes, led by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE), will serve as national hubs for research and innovation in these critical industries. The NSF-led AI Research Institutes will receive $140 million over five years and will focus on areas such as machine learning, synthetic manufacturing, precision agriculture, and prediction forecasting. The DOE-led QIS Research Centers will receive up to $625 million over five years and will focus on quantum networking, sensing, computing, and materials manufacturing. The goal of these investments is to accelerate discovery, promote job creation, and ensure American leadership in these emerging technologies. The institutes will also prioritize training, education, and outreach to ensure participation from Americans of all backgrounds.
