President Joe Biden expresses his gratitude for Jeff Zients' leadership in the country's COVID-19 response. He highlights the progress made under Zients' guidance, such as the significant increase in vaccination rates, the reopening of schools, and the distribution of at-home COVID tests. The US has also been a leading contributor in global vaccine efforts. Biden acknowledges that there is still work to be done, including providing more vaccines and boosters, getting approval for vaccines for young children, improving COVID-19 protocols in schools and workplaces, and preparing for new waves and variants. To continue the fight against COVID-19, President Biden appoints Dr. Ashish Jha as the new White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator, praising his expertise and public presence. The president appreciates the collaboration between Zients and Jha during the transition and looks forward to further progress in the coming months.
