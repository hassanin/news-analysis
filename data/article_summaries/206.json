Today marks 100 days of captivity for over 100 innocent people, including up to 6 Americans, held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. The hostages have lived in constant fear for their lives, while their families have endured agony and prayed for their safe return. The US administration has been actively engaged in diplomatic efforts to secure their freedom, resulting in the release of two Americans in October and a temporary ceasefire in November. Despite Hamas walking away from the deal, the US, along with Qatar, Egypt, and Israel, remains committed to finding a path forward for a comprehensive agreement. The President expresses his solidarity with the hostages and their families and vows to continue working tirelessly to bring them home.
