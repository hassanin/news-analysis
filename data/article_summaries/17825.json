In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims September 2013 as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. He highlights that prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths among American men. While rates have declined over the past two decades, there are still an estimated 239,000 new cases and 30,000 deaths from prostate cancer in 2013. The causes of prostate cancer are still unknown, but there are identified risk factors such as age, family history, and being African American. The President encourages men to learn about warning signs by visiting www.Cancer.gov. He also mentions that his administration supports prostate cancer research and the Affordable Care Act provides new protections for all Americans, including eliminating annual dollar limits on vital benefits and preventing denial of coverage or higher premiums for patients with pre-existing conditions like prostate cancer. The President calls on all Americans to support those affected by prostate cancer and participate in activities that increase awareness and prevention.
