The White House has released a progress report on President Obama's Climate Action Plan, which was announced one year ago. The report highlights various actions taken by the Administration to reduce carbon pollution and protect public health. These actions include setting new efficiency standards, permitting renewable energy projects, and proposing carbon pollution standards for power plants. The Administration is also working with partners to make communities more resilient to severe weather and reduce greenhouse gas emissions internationally. The policies implemented in the past year are projected to cut nearly 3 billion tons of carbon pollution by 2025, develop 8,100 megawatts of renewable energy, train over 50,000 workers for the solar industry, save consumers $60 billion on energy bills, improve the energy efficiency of buildings across the country, and prevent asthma attacks and heart attacks among vulnerable Americans.
