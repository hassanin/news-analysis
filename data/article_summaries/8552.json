President Biden unveiled his Build Back Better Agenda one year ago, aiming to address the challenges faced by the country, including the pandemic, economic downturn, climate crisis, and racial injustices. The agenda includes the American Families Plan and key elements of the American Jobs Plan. The plan aims to create jobs, cut taxes, and lower costs for working families. It proposes measures such as letting Medicare negotiate drug prices to lower prescription drug costs, making universal preschool a reality to lower child care costs, extending the American Rescue Plan's cost savings to lower health care costs, providing two years of free community college and increasing Pell Grant awards to lower higher education costs, and investing in affordable housing to lower housing costs. The agenda also includes tax cuts for families with children and workers without children. It emphasizes workforce training, clean energy jobs, and investments in teachers and schools to create jobs and improve education. President Biden and Vice President Harris have expressed support for including immigration reform in the agenda to provide pathways to citizenship for Dreamers, TPS recipients, farmworkers, and essential workers.
