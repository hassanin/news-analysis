President Barack Obama sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, informing them of the deployment of additional U.S. military personnel to South Sudan. The purpose of this deployment was to conduct an operation to evacuate U.S. citizens and personnel. However, the operation was curtailed due to security concerns after the aircraft came under fire. President Obama stated that he may take further action to support the security of U.S. citizens and property in South Sudan. He emphasized that these actions are in line with his responsibility to protect U.S. citizens and national security interests.
