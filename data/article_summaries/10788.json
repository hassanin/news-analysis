In a meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, President Obama expressed his disappointment with the failure of the DREAM Act in the U.S. Senate. The act had the support of a majority of Senators and the American people, and would have reduced the budget deficit by $2.2 billion over the next 10 years. The President emphasized his commitment to comprehensive immigration reform and the need to fix a broken immigration system. Both parties agreed to work together to advance proposals that strengthen border security and restore responsibility to the immigration system. The meeting included members such as Senator Bob Menendez, Congressman Xavier Becerra, Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, Congressman Charlie Gonzalez, and Congressman Luis Gutierrez.
