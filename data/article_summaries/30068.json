He acknowledges that the United States has fallen behind in the rankings of the world's fastest supercomputers and expresses the need to catch up. Perry authorized the deployment of the first US exascale system, which is expected to be the fastest and most powerful supercomputer in the world by 2021. The Trump administration is committed to expanding the use of exascale systems and has announced a request for proposals for the development of two new exascale computers. Perry highlights the potential of supercomputers in areas such as precision medicine and optimizing medical treatments for veterans. He concludes by emphasizing the importance of not falling behind in supercomputing and the opportunity to build new systems that can improve the nation.
