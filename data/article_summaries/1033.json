The White House announced the successful negotiation and release of Brittney Griner, an American citizen who was wrongfully detained in Russia. The negotiations were the result of months of efforts by officials from the White House, the State Department, and across the administration. The release of Griner was a priority for President Biden, who has made it a commitment to bring home Americans who are wrongfully detained abroad. The negotiations with Russia also involved attempts to secure the release of Paul Whelan, another American citizen who is still being detained. However, the Russians treated Whelan's situation differently, and no agreement could be reached for his release at this time. The President remains committed to bringing Whelan and other wrongfully detained Americans home.
