President Biden held a meeting with his administration to discuss new actions aimed at lowering costs for American families. He highlighted the progress made in the economy, including increased growth and wages, as well as the record number of Americans starting small businesses. The President emphasized the importance of fair competition and promoting it across the entire economy, stating that capitalism without competition is exploitation.

The President outlined several initiatives that have been implemented to promote fair competition, such as requiring internet providers to list fees upfront, convincing airlines to rebook cancellation flights for free, and pushing banks to eliminate surprise fees. He also mentioned the Federal Trade Commission's proposed rule to ban non-compete agreements for 30 million Americans.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is proposing a new rule to lower credit card late fees, aiming to reduce the average fee from $31 to $8. The proposed change is expected to save Americans around $9 billion annually. President Biden called on Congress to pass the Junk Fee Protection Act, which would ban frustrating charges such as extra fees for seat selection on airlines, resort fees at hotels, early termination penalties for internet, cable, or cell phone plans, and high service fees from companies like Ticketmaster.

The President emphasized that these unfair fees add up and called for a fair economy that works for everyone. He acknowledged the challenges faced by Americans and expressed the administration's commitment to rebuilding confidence in the government's ability to deliver for the people.
