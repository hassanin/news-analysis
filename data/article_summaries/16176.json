On the one-year anniversary of the tragedy at the Upper Big Branch mine, the President expresses condolences for the miners who lost their lives and their families. The administration has taken steps to investigate the cause of the explosion, hold those responsible accountable, and prevent similar incidents in the future. The Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration conducted a thorough investigation and took action against mine operators who failed to prioritize safety. The Justice Department's investigation has resulted in two criminal indictments against the mine owner. The Department of Labor has implemented new measures to prevent future incidents, such as targeting mines with persistent violations through "impact inspections" and successfully arguing for the temporary closure of mines with severe safety issues. The President supports efforts to strengthen mine safety laws to ensure the safety of workers and their families.
