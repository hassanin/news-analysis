On May 15, 2019, President Trump declared a national emergency to address the threat posed by the unrestricted acquisition and use of certain information and communications technology and services transactions. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The acquisition or use of technology or services by persons owned by or controlled by foreign adversaries enhances their ability to exploit vulnerabilities in information and communications technology, which can have severe consequences. The national emergency declared in May 2019 is being extended for another year to secure the supply chain of information and communications technology and services. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
