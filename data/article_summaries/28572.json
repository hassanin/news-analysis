According to a study released by Glassdoor, national wage growth in the US is at its highest level in nearly 17 months and is expected to continue rising. Glassdoor economist Daniel Zhao predicts that wages will continue to increase as there remains a demand for workers in various industries. Wages grew 2.6 percent year-over-year from 2017 to $52,664, the fastest growth since April 2017. Certain industries, such as health care, have seen even larger increases in pay, suggesting potential opportunities in those fields.
