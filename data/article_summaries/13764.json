President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Nebraska due to flooding that occurred between May 24 and August 1, 2011. This declaration allows federal funding to be provided to affected individuals and communities in several counties. The assistance includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Michael L. Parker as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. FEMA will also assess further damage and may provide additional designations if necessary. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
