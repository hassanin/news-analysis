In a recent press conference, Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator, discussed the milestone of having new updated COVID-19 vaccines authorized for all Americans aged 12 and above. These vaccines match the Omicron variant, which is currently dominant in the US and worldwide. Dr. Jha emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated with the updated shots, as they provide better protection against infection, transmission, and serious illness. He also mentioned that for the first time since December 2020, the vaccines have caught up with the virus. The Biden administration has been working closely with state and local health departments, pharmacies, and healthcare providers to ensure ample supply and accessibility of the vaccines. Dr. Anthony Fauci added that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective, and the updated vaccines offer even better protection against currently circulating strains. He encouraged everyone to get their updated COVID-19 shot as soon as they are eligible. Secretary Xavier Becerra discussed the efforts to make the new vaccines widely and equitably available to all Americans, including partnerships with community-based organizations and targeted outreach to vulnerable populations. The press conference also addressed concerns about potential confusion due to different vaccine versions and emphasized the ongoing need for COVID-19 funding from Congress to support the response efforts.
