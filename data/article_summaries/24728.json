The United States government has taken steps to promote and protect the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals both domestically and internationally. The government has made LGBT rights a foreign policy priority and has implemented various initiatives to combat discrimination and violence against LGBT individuals. The State Department has revised its policies to allow same-sex couples to obtain passports and has expanded coverage of LGBT rights in its annual Human Rights Reports. Several government agencies are providing training to staff on LGBT issues, and the State Department has appointed a Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBT Persons. The United States has also been active in the multilateral arena, co-sponsoring resolutions on LGBT rights at the United Nations and working with international organizations to address discrimination and barriers to healthcare for LGBT individuals. The government provides support to LGBT activists and organizations worldwide through the Global Equality Fund and other programs. U.S. diplomats and development professionals work with host countries to address discriminatory laws and practices and encourage more inclusive policies. The government has publicly and privately pushed back against discriminatory legislation and continues to speak out in support of LGBT rights. The White House has hosted forums and conferences to discuss and strategize on promoting respect for the human rights of LGBT individuals. U.S. embassies, USAID missions, and Department of Defense installations participate in Pride events.
