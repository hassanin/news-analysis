The Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., discusses the role of the Department of Commerce and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in preparing for and responding to hurricanes. He highlights the accurate and timely forecasts provided by NOAA, which help residents, local officials, and emergency management communities make informed decisions. Ross also emphasizes the dedication of the NOAA team members and the technological advancements that have improved the accuracy of storm predictions. In addition to providing warnings, NOAA supports recovery efforts after hurricanes, including conducting surveys to detect underwater hazards, providing oceanographic data for maritime commerce, and assessing damage through aerial photos. The Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration also works to ensure that local businesses affected by storms have access to resources for recovery. Ross concludes by emphasizing the ongoing need for preparedness and the commitment of the Department of Commerce to support communities in the face of future storms.
