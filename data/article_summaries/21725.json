President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation designating July 18 through July 24, 2010, as Captive Nations Week. This proclamation is in solidarity with individuals living without personal or political autonomy behind the Iron Curtain. The proclamation recognizes that while many nations have embraced self-governance and basic human rights, there are still regimes that suppress the aspirations of their people through violence, threats, and isolation. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of standing with those who yearn to exercise their universal human rights and advocates for reinforcing multilateral institutions and international partnerships that safeguard human rights and democratic values. It also calls for empowering civil societies and helping people connect with one another and the global community through new technologies. The proclamation urges the people of the United States to reaffirm their commitment to all those working for human rights and dignity around the world.
