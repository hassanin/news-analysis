During her trip to Warsaw, Poland, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that the United States will provide nearly $53 million in humanitarian assistance to support civilians affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This assistance will be channeled through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and will include support to the UN World Food Program (WFP) to provide emergency food assistance to those affected by the invasion. The funding will also support WFP's logistics operations to deliver aid to Ukraine, including the capital city, Kyiv. This new assistance is in addition to the $54 million announced by the United States less than two weeks ago, bringing the total humanitarian aid provided since October 2020 to $159 million. The aid includes provisions such as health supplies, food assistance, blankets, and other relief items. The United States is currently the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. The conflict has forced two million people to flee the country, with an estimated one million internally displaced. Approximately 12 million people in Ukraine are in need of humanitarian aid. The United States reaffirms its commitment to supporting Ukraine and will continue to address immediate needs and save lives.
