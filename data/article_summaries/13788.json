The White House has issued a statement welcoming the report by the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, which provides an assessment of events in Bahrain since protests began in February. The report identifies human rights abuses and urges the government to hold those responsible accountable and make institutional changes to prevent such abuses in the future. The statement commends King Hamad for establishing the Commission and his commitment to implementing its recommendations. The United States believes that the report and subsequent steps can help advance reconciliation and reform in Bahrain. The US urges the government and all parties to respect universal human rights and work towards meaningful reforms that meet the aspirations of all Bahrainis.
