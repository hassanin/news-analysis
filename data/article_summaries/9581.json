President Barack Obama has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Lebanon. This emergency was declared in 2007 due to the actions of certain individuals undermining Lebanon's sovereignty and democratic processes. Despite some recent positive developments in the Syrian-Lebanese relationship, the ongoing transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah undermines Lebanon's sovereignty and contributes to instability in the region. President Obama believes that this poses a significant threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency and the measures adopted to address the threat.
