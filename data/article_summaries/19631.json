President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Ohio due to severe storms and straight-line winds that occurred from June 29 to July 2, 2012. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be provided to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The designated counties include Adams, Allen, Athens, Auglaize, Belmont, Champaign, Clark, Coshocton, and many others. Additionally, federal funding will be available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. W. Michael Moore has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
