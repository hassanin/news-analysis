On May 1, 2013, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 1246, is called the "District of Columbia Chief Financial Officer Vacancy Act." This bill allows certain individuals to serve in an acting capacity if there is a vacancy in the Office of Chief Financial Officer of the District of Columbia. The second bill, H.R. 1765, is called the "Reducing Flight Delays Act of 2013." This bill gives the Secretary of Transportation the ability to transfer funds to prevent reduced operations and staffing of the Federal Aviation Administration, which helps reduce flight delays.
