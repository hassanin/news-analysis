The White House Press Secretary issued a statement criticizing Congressman Joe Barton for his apology to BP regarding the compensation fund for those affected by the Gulf Coast disaster. The statement argues that Barton's concern for big corporations is misplaced and that the real tragedy is the suffering of the Gulf Coast communities. The Press Secretary calls on members of both parties to reject Barton's comments.
