President Donald J. Trump has authorized an increase in federal funding for debris removal in the state of Florida following Hurricane Irma. Under the major disaster declaration issued on September 10, 2017, federal funding for debris removal was set at 75% of the total eligible costs. However, the President's order today increases the federal share to 90% of the total eligible costs for a period of 30 days from the date of the declaration.
