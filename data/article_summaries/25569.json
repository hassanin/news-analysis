First Lady Melania Trump participated in the reopening of the Washington Monument after it was closed for over 37 months for renovations and additional construction. She was joined by Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt, Assistant Secretary of the Interior Rob Wallace, and other officials. The First Lady took part in a ribbon-cutting ceremony and made a ceremonial first ride to the top of the monument with fourth-grade students. As part of her Be Best initiative, Melania Trump also distributed "Every Kid in the Outdoors" 4th Grade passes, which provide free access to federal recreation areas for fourth graders and their companions. The program aims to help children connect with nature and the environment and establish a lifelong connection with the American outdoor heritage.
