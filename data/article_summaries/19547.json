President Obama has established a bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform to address the country's fiscal problems. Former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Republican Senate Whip Alan Simpson have been named as co-chairs of the Commission. The Commission will make recommendations to achieve primary balance in the budget by 2015 and improve the long-term fiscal outlook. It will consist of 18 members, with 12 appointed by Senate/House leaders and 6 appointed by the President. The recommendations must be reported to Congress by December 1, 2010. President Obama has prioritized fiscal responsibility, including deficit reduction, line-by-line budget review, and tackling rising healthcare costs. Bowles and Simpson have extensive experience in government and are expected to lead the Commission effectively.
