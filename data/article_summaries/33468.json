President Donald J. Trump has granted a full pardon to General Michael T. Flynn. The President believes that General Flynn should never have been prosecuted, and an independent review by the Department of Justice supports this conclusion. The Department of Justice has determined that the charges against General Flynn should be dropped. The pardon brings an end to what is seen as a relentless and partisan pursuit of an innocent man. The President argues that General Flynn is innocent, even stating that the FBI agents who interviewed him did not believe he was lying. Multiple investigations have shown that General Flynn was the victim of partisan government officials who sought to undermine the 2016 election and prevent Donald Trump from assuming office. The President also criticizes the complicit media for publishing falsehoods and hiding inconvenient facts. This pardon serves as a reminder for the American people to remain vigilant and hold those in power accountable. The President extends his Thanksgiving wishes to General Flynn and his family.
