President Donald J. Trump has authorized the modification of the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The tariffs will be suspended for certain countries until May 1, 2018, pending discussions on alternative means to address the threat to U.S. national security. The European Union will negotiate on behalf of its member countries. The President has the authority to further modify the tariffs, including removing the suspensions or adding additional countries. The Administration will closely monitor imports from exempted countries and may impose quotas if necessary. The tariffs will go into effect on March 23, 2018. The process for affected parties to apply for exclusions for specific steel or aluminum products remains in place. The Secretary of Commerce will evaluate exclusion requests, considering national security considerations and domestic production capacity.
