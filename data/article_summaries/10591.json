The President congratulates Congress for reaching an agreement to prevent a tax increase on working Americans. Every working American will keep their tax cut, which amounts to about $1,000 for the average family. Unemployment insurance will also continue for those who are looking for work. The President urges Congress to work on extending this tax cut and unemployment insurance for all of 2012. This is seen as good news for the holidays and is expected to strengthen families, grow the economy, and create new jobs. The President thanks Americans for raising their voices and making a difference in this debate.
