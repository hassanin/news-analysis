The White House has announced new commitments to the Equal Pay Pledge, with 29 additional companies signing on. This brings the total number of companies and organizations committed to closing the gender pay gap to over 50. Some of the newly-committed employers include Apple, CVS, Facebook, Target, and Visa. The Equal Pay Pledge requires companies to conduct annual gender pay analysis, review hiring and promotion processes to reduce bias, embed equal pay efforts into broader equity initiatives, and identify and promote other best practices to close the wage gap. The pledge is part of the Obama administration's efforts to ensure fair pay for all Americans and boost productivity and the economy.
