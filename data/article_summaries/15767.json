This article is a presidential memorandum from Barack Obama to the Secretary of Defense regarding the Twelfth Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation. The memorandum states that every 4 years, the President is required to review the compensation system for uniformed service members of the Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Public Health Service. The memorandum also mentions that the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission has been established to conduct a review of the military compensation and retirement systems and make recommendations for their modernization. The Commission is required to submit a report to the President by February 1, 2015, containing a comprehensive study, recommendations, and detailed findings and conclusions. The President has determined that the Commission's report also satisfies the requirements of the Twelfth Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation, so a separate review is not necessary.
