On October 1, 2009, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13513, titled "Federal Leadership on Reducing Text Messaging while Driving." The order aimed to improve safety on roads and highways and enhance the efficiency of federal contracting by prohibiting federal employees from engaging in text messaging while driving government-owned, government-leased, or government-rented vehicles, as well as privately-owned vehicles while on official government business. It also extended this policy to cover federal contractors. The order directed all executive branch agencies to take appropriate action to implement the policies, including considering new rules, conducting education and awareness programs, and enforcing disciplinary actions for non-compliance. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, was tasked with providing leadership and guidance to assist agencies in implementing the order. The order included definitions for terms like "texting" and "driving" and contained general provisions to ensure compliance with applicable laws and availability of appropriations.
