The House of Representatives has passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act, which aims to provide quality and affordable health care for the American people. The legislation will offer stability and security for those with insurance, affordable options for those without, and reduce the cost of health care for families, businesses, and the government. It is also fully paid for and will decrease the long-term federal deficit. The Senate now needs to pass its version of the legislation, and President Obama is confident that this will happen. He hopes to sign comprehensive health insurance reform into law by the end of the year.
