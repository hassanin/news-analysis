In a recent conversation, President Biden spoke with Senator Shelley Moore Capito and Chairman Peter DeFazio regarding the infrastructure plan. Senator Capito presented a new offer from her group, which included a $50 billion increase in spending on various infrastructure programs. However, the President expressed gratitude for the effort but stated that the offer did not meet his objectives of economic growth, addressing the climate crisis, and creating new jobs. The President plans to continue engaging with senators from both parties in hopes of reaching a more substantial package. They agreed to speak again on Monday. Additionally, President Biden spoke with Chairman DeFazio to express gratitude for his work on key elements of the American Jobs Plan and offered support for the Committee mark-up that Chairman DeFazio will begin on Wednesday. Both the President and Chairman DeFazio emphasized the importance of continued engagement with senators from both parties as the House works on infrastructure in the coming week.
