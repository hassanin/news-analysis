This article discusses the existence of disputes between certain railroads represented by the National Carriers' Conference Committee of the National Railway Labor Conference and their employees represented by labor organizations. These disputes have not yet been resolved under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act. The National Mediation Board has notified that these disputes pose a threat to interstate commerce and may disrupt essential transportation services in certain parts of the country. As a result, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has ordered the establishment of an Emergency Board composed of a chair and two other members to investigate and report on these disputes. The Board is required to submit its report to the President within 30 days of its creation. During this period, no changes in the conditions underlying the disputes can be made by the parties involved, except by mutual agreement. The records and files of the Board will be maintained by the National Mediation Board after the Board's termination.
