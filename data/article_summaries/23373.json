The White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, addressed a number of topics during a press briefing. He discussed the Obama administration's concerns about passing legislation that would impose additional sanctions on Iran, as it could undermine the ongoing nuclear negotiations. He also spoke about the situation in Yemen and the US's commitment to counterterrorism efforts in the country. Earnest mentioned that the US is closely monitoring the situation in Yemen and is ready to take necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of American personnel. He also mentioned that the US values its counterterrorism partnership with Saudi Arabia and expects it to continue under the new leadership. In addition, Earnest addressed questions about the relationship between the US and Israel, specifically regarding the invitation for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak before Congress. He stated that it is not the usual protocol for a foreign leader to visit the US without coordinating with the President, but ultimately it is the Speaker of the House's responsibility to schedule such visits. Earnest mentioned that the President will not meet with Netanyahu during his visit to the US due to the upcoming Israeli elections. Earnest also briefly discussed campaign finance reform, the President's upcoming trip to India, and other topics.
