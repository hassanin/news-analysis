The President of the United States has issued a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria will continue beyond May 11, 2020. The Syrian regime's brutal war on its people, including the use of chemical weapons and support for terrorist organizations, poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The US condemns the violence and human rights abuses committed by the Assad regime, as well as its Russian and Iranian supporters. The US calls for a nationwide ceasefire, unobstructed delivery of humanitarian assistance, and a political transition in Syria. The US will consider changes in the Syrian government's composition, policies, and actions in determining the future of this national emergency.
