President Obama has declared a major disaster in Tennessee and authorized federal aid to help with recovery efforts from severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred between June 18-24, 2011. The funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Claiborne, Grainger, Henderson, Knox, Loudon, and Marion are eligible for this assistance. Additionally, federal funding will be provided for statewide hazard mitigation measures. W. Montague Winfield has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. More designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
