President Biden is set to announce new executive actions to address climate change, create jobs in clean energy, and lower costs for families. The actions will aim to protect communities from climate impacts, such as extreme heat conditions, and expand offshore wind opportunities and jobs in the United States. The President will make the announcements at a former coal-fired power plant in Massachusetts that will now host a cable manufacturing facility for the offshore wind industry. The executive actions will also focus on protecting communities from extreme heat and advancing workplace safety, building local resilience, and addressing the disproportionate impacts of extreme heat. Additionally, the Biden administration will boost the offshore wind industry by approving large-scale projects, accelerating permitting, and supporting the development of a U.S.-based supply chain. These actions align with President Biden's commitment to tackling the climate crisis, promoting clean energy, and creating a sustainable future while saving families money and advancing environmental justice.
