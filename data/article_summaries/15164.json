The statement by the Principal Deputy Press Secretary reflects on World Humanitarian Day, which commemorates the 22 humanitarian aid workers who were killed in an attack on the UN Headquarters in Baghdad 11 years ago. The statement emphasizes the increasing need for humanitarians, as there are currently 108 million people requiring humanitarian assistance and more people displaced by conflict than at any time since World War II. It highlights the dire situations in countries such as Syria, Iraq, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Gaza, Somalia, Yemen, and West Africa due to conflicts and the Ebola outbreak. The statement acknowledges the personal risks humanitarians face and the unfortunate incidents of violence against aid workers, with 460 killed, kidnapped, or seriously wounded in 2013. The United States, as the largest humanitarian donor, expresses its respect and support for these individuals and calls for more dedication, selflessness, and courage in addressing global humanitarian crises.
