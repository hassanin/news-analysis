President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Texas and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe storms and flooding that occurred from June 19, 2018, onwards. This declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Cameron and Hidalgo. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Jerry S. Thomas has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the State and warranted by further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance by registering online at DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (local time) seven days a week until further notice.
