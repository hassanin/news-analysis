The White House will open its South Lawn to trick-or-treaters on October 30, 2017. The event is open to schoolchildren and parents from over 20 schools in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, as well as military families and community organizations. The South Portico will be decorated with spider webs, bats, and orange pumpkins featuring profiles of past presidents. Fog will fill the air, and the trees and south facade will be lit with different colors. The President and First Lady will hand out cookies, Presidential M&M's, and other candies. Various departments and agencies will also be present to give out items and participate in the festivities. Certain items such as aerosols, animals (except guide dogs), backpacks (oversized), balloons, beverages, and fireworks/firecrackers are not allowed on the White House grounds. Strollers, wheelchairs, umbrellas (no metal tips), and cameras are permitted. In case of inclement weather, the event may be cancelled.
