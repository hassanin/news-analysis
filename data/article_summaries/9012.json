In a teleconference held in the Roosevelt Room, President Biden thanked Chairman Chey of the SK Group for their significant investments in the United States. The SK Group, the second-largest conglomerate in South Korea, has already committed $30 billion in investment in the US and announced an additional $22 billion investment. This will create jobs and expand their presence in a range of advanced technologies, including semiconductors, batteries, electric vehicle chargers, and pharmaceuticals. President Biden highlighted the importance of these investments in the context of the US-China technology competition and emphasized the opportunities for collaboration and partnership between the two countries. He also mentioned the importance of investing in American workers and creating a skilled workforce through collaboration with state and community colleges. Chairman Chey expressed his commitment to working with the US in building a skilled workforce and fostering partnerships between companies and nonprofit organizations in both countries. He cited examples of successful collaborations, such as working with Novavax to produce the COVID-19 vaccine and partnering with the Gates Foundation and the University of Washington to develop a new COVID vaccine. President Biden expressed his gratitude for the partnership between the US and South Korea and pledged to continue investing in education and training to ensure a highly skilled workforce. He also expressed his desire to meet in person during their next visit to the White House.
