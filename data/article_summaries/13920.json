This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on March 7, 2011. It addresses the unexpected and urgent refugee and migration needs related to Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast). The memorandum states that the President determines it is important to provide assistance under the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962. The assistance, not exceeding $12.6 million, will be used to meet the refugee and migration needs resulting from the recent unrest in Cote d'Ivoire. This includes contributions to international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, as well as the payment of administrative expenses of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration of the Department of State. The memorandum concludes by authorizing and directing the publication of the memorandum in the Federal Register.
