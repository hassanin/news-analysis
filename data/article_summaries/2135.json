The White House has released state fact sheets highlighting the importance of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, which is the largest long-term investment in infrastructure and competitiveness in almost a century. These fact sheets emphasize how the framework will create well-paying, union jobs, stimulate economic growth, and position the United States for success in the 21st century. Individual fact sheets for each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories are provided, along with a fact sheet on how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework promotes racial equity.
