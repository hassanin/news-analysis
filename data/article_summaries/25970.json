President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in Guam and ordered Federal assistance to support recovery efforts in areas affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This declaration allows Federal funding to be provided to the territory and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency protective measures. Robert J. Fenton has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Further designations may be made in the future based on requests from Guam and the results of assessments. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
