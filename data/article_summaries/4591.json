President Biden visited the Capitol Child Development Center in Hartford, Connecticut to discuss the importance of investing in childcare and early education. He shared personal experiences of struggling to afford childcare as a young senator and emphasized the need to support working families. He highlighted his proposed Build Back Better plan, which aims to cut the cost of childcare for families and provide two years of high-quality preschool for every child in America. The plan also includes investments in higher education, tax credits for businesses to build onsite care facilities, and an extension of the Child Tax Credit. President Biden stressed the importance of these investments for the future competitiveness of the United States and urged Congress to pass the legislation.
