President Biden has announced that the United States will provide $100 million in humanitarian assistance to support the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. This funding will help over a million displaced and conflict-affected individuals with essential needs such as clean water, food, medical care, and hygiene support. The assistance will be provided through trusted partners like UN agencies and international NGOs. The President emphasized that civilians should not suffer for Hamas's terrorism and that their lives must be protected. The United States will work closely with regional partners to uphold the law of war, support those in need, and ensure access to food, water, medical care, and shelter.
