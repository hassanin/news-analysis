The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will go into effect today, thanks to the leadership of President Trump. The agreement is expected to bring stronger economic growth, more jobs for American workers, and fairer trade for the country. It includes comprehensive labor provisions and will benefit American farmers by giving them access to fairer markets in Canada and Mexico. The USMCA aims to strengthen American manufacturing and incentivize investment in high-paying auto manufacturing jobs in the United States. It replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and is considered a fair deal for American workers, bringing the trade relationship with Canada and Mexico into the 21st century.
