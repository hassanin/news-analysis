President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation on November 15, 2019, in honor of American Education Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of equal access to education for every child in America. It recognizes the responsibility of states and local officials in making education policy decisions and highlights the contributions of teachers and administrators. The proclamation emphasizes the need for education to be a lifelong process that inspires students to become lifelong learners. It also advocates for educational freedom, opposing burdensome regulations and constraints on teachers and promoting the rights of parents to play an active role in their children's education. The proclamation mentions the proposed Education Freedom Scholarships, which would provide federal tax credits for voluntary donations to state-based scholarship programs. It also highlights the allocation of funding for innovative and personalized education programs, particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The proclamation concludes by calling on states and communities to support high-quality education to meet the needs of all students.
