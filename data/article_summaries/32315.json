The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced the largest-ever amount of annual baseline funding for its High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program. Over $266 million will be distributed to 29 regional HIDTA Programs across the United States and its territories. The HIDTA Program aims to coordinate the efforts of federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners in disrupting and dismantling drug trafficking organizations. The funding increase demonstrates the Trump Administration's recognition of the program's effectiveness in keeping communities safe from drug-related threats. In 2018, President Trump established a new HIDTA program in Alaska, ensuring that all 50 states receive funding through the program.
