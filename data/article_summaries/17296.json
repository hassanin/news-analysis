The White House Press Secretary released a statement on the Senate Democratic budget. The statement highlights that the budget aims to grow the economy, reduce deficits, and prioritize the middle class. It emphasizes investments in areas like education, manufacturing, and infrastructure, while also seeking to find savings and eliminate wasteful spending. The budget includes spending cuts and tax reform to ensure that the burden of deficit reduction is not solely placed on seniors and the middle class. The statement also mentions that both Republicans and Democrats have presented their plans, and the President looks forward to finding common ground and compromise with Congress to achieve economic growth, job creation, and deficit reduction in a balanced manner.
