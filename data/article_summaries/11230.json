The United States strongly condemns the violence in South Sudan that resulted in the killing of internally displaced persons and the destruction of a facility that provides aid to victims of the conflict. Reports suggest that South Sudanese Government soldiers entered a UN compound and opened fire on civilians seeking refuge. The US calls on the South Sudanese Government to investigate this violence, identify the soldiers responsible, and bring them to justice. Condolences are expressed to the families of those killed, including two Médecins Sans Frontières workers. The US also urges all parties in South Sudan to exercise restraint and avoid further violence. The lack of progress in implementing the August 2015 peace agreement and the government's decision to establish 28 states without local consultations have undermined peace efforts. President Salva Kiir is called upon to suspend the implementation of the decree, and both parties are urged to make rapid progress in implementing the agreement, including establishing security arrangements and forming a transitional government.
