President Trump signed the Women's Suffrage Centennial Commemorative Coin Act into law, which directs the Treasury Department to issue 400,000 one-dollar silver coins to commemorate the 100th anniversary of women securing the right to vote. The coins will honor the women's suffrage movement and the heroes who fought for women's right to vote. All proceeds from the sale of these coins will go to the Smithsonian's Women's History Initiative. President Trump commended the bipartisan effort and the hard work of those involved in passing the bill.
