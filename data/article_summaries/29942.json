Vice President Mike Pence delivered a speech at the Pentagon announcing the Trump administration's plan to establish a new branch of the military called the United States Space Force. Pence outlined the need for a Space Force to address the growing security threats in space, such as jamming and disabling satellites, as well as the militarization of space by other nations. The report released by the Department of Defense outlines the steps to create the Space Force, including the establishment of a unified combatant command for space, a Space Operations Force, a Space Development Agency, and a new Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space. The administration plans to work with Congress to establish the Space Force by 2020.
