President Biden is set to visit areas in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties in California that have been impacted by severe flooding and mudslides caused by recent storms. The President will be joined by Governor Newsom and will meet with first responders, state and local officials, and affected communities. He will survey the damage, discuss recovery efforts, and assess the need for additional federal support. The President has authorized additional disaster assistance and increased the federal share for debris removal and emergency protective measures to 100 percent for 60 days. FEMA and other federal personnel have already been deployed to California to support response and recovery operations. The storms in California have been described as unprecedented, with nine atmospheric rivers causing extensive damage. The President's visit aims to show support for the affected communities and ensure they receive the necessary assistance.
