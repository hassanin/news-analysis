The White House Coronavirus Task Force held a press briefing to discuss the government's efforts to address the spread of the coronavirus in the United States. Vice President Mike Pence began by assuring the public that the risk of contracting the virus remains low. He then addressed the situation with the Grand Princess cruise ship, which has been moored off the coast of California with confirmed cases of coronavirus on board. Pence announced that a plan has been developed to bring the ship into a noncommercial port, test all passengers and crew for the virus, and provide necessary quarantine and medical attention. Pence also discussed the availability of testing, stating that all state labs have the necessary tests and that commercial labs will begin offering tests by Monday. He emphasized that the government is working to ensure that testing resources are widely available to the public. Other members of the task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, spoke about the importance of social distancing and protecting vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. The press briefing concluded with a Q&A session, during which the officials addressed questions about economic mitigation efforts for workers and best practices for families dealing with potential exposure to the virus.
