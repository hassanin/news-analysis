President Obama, along with financial experts and lawmakers, has called for new restrictions on the size and scope of financial institutions. The aim is to rein in excessive risk-taking and protect taxpayers. The proposal includes limiting banks and other financial institutions from owning hedge funds, private equity funds, or engaging in proprietary trading unrelated to customer service. Additionally, the proposal seeks to limit the consolidation of the financial sector and the market share of liabilities at large financial firms. The President intends to work with Congress to strengthen the existing financial reform package and create comprehensive rules and safeguards for consumers. The goal is to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis and end the notion of "Too Big to Fail."
