The article discusses the National Clean Fleets Partnership, a collaboration between the public and private sectors to work with large commercial fleets in order to significantly reduce oil consumption. The partnership aims to incorporate electric vehicles, alternative fuels, and fuel-saving measures into the daily operations of these fleets. The Department of Energy (DOE) will provide specialized resources, technical expertise, and support to help companies reduce fuel consumption and achieve greater efficiency and savings. Five founding members of the partnership, including AT&T, FedEx, PepsiCo, UPS, and Verizon, will announce their plans to reduce petroleum consumption, which will involve the use of over 20,000 advanced technology vehicles and the replacement of over 7 million gallons of oil annually. The DOE is encouraging other companies to join this effort. The article also mentions that commercial fleets offer a significant opportunity to reduce fuel consumption and carbon pollution, as they rely heavily on petroleum-derived fuels. The DOE will assist companies in reducing fuel consumption through the use of more efficient technology and vehicles, as well as the replacement of conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles with advanced technology or alternative fuel vehicles. The partnership offers opportunities for collaboration, technical assistance, and access to DOE tools and resources. This program complements the Smartway Transport partnership between the EPA and the freight transportation sector, as both initiatives aim to improve efficiency in product transportation and reduce dependence on foreign oil.
