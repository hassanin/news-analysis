President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan, which was declared in Executive Order 13067 on November 3, 1997, will continue beyond November 3, 2021. This decision comes in light of the military takeover of the Sudanese government and the arrest of civilian leaders, which threaten the progress made towards democracy since 2019. The crisis that led to the declaration of the national emergency has not been resolved, and the situation in Darfur continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
