The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has released its advance estimate of U.S. GDP for the first quarter of 2020, revealing a contraction of 4.8 percent at an annual rate. This marks the first decline in six years and confirms the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, bringing an end to the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. Consumer spending played a significant role in the contraction, with a sharp decline that contributed to the overall decline in GDP. Consumer spending makes up approximately 68 percent of GDP, and the decline was driven by suppressed spending on services and durable goods. The service sector, in particular, saw significant declines in household spending on healthcare services, transportation, recreation, and food services and accommodations. Spending on durable goods, such as motor vehicles and household equipment, also declined. However, there was growth in spending on nondurable goods, driven by increased spending on at-home food and beverages. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the United States is in a strong position to recover as the public health threat recedes. Prior to the pandemic, GDP and job growth were exceeding expectations, consumer and business optimism were high, and wages were rising. The United States also had the strongest real GDP growth among G7 countries. The Trump Administration has worked with Congress to provide support for workers and businesses, aiming to limit the negative effects on the economy in the second quarter as states gradually reopen and people return to work.
