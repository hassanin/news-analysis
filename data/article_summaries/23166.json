President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, declared in Executive Order 12978 in 1995, is to continue beyond October 21, 2013. The President states that the circumstances that led to the declaration of the national emergency have not been resolved, and that the actions of significant narcotics traffickers in Colombia continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency in order to address the violence, corruption, and harm caused by these traffickers.
