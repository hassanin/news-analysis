During a recent press briefing, Jeff Zients, the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator, provided an update on the government's response to the pandemic. He expressed concern about the rise in cases driven by the Delta variant, particularly in communities with lower vaccination rates. He highlighted that the seven states with the lowest vaccination rates accounted for more than 17% of cases, and one in three cases nationwide occurred in Florida and Texas. Zients emphasized the importance of vaccines as the most effective tool in managing the pandemic and stated that there are enough vaccines for every American who wants one.

Zients also discussed the efforts being made to increase vaccination rates. These include expanding tax credits for small- and medium-sized businesses to provide paid time off for employees to get vaccinated, bringing vaccines to schools to make it convenient for students to get vaccinated, and working with states to offer incentives for vaccination. He mentioned that some states and local governments are offering $100 to anyone who gets fully vaccinated.

Zients highlighted the actions taken by the federal government to protect the workforce and encourage vaccination. The Department of Veterans Affairs will require healthcare workers who provide medical care to veterans to get vaccinated, and the Department of Defense is considering adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of required vaccinations for the military. Additionally, federal government employees will be asked to attest to their vaccination status, and those who are not vaccinated will be required to follow certain protocols such as wearing masks, getting tested regularly, and limiting travel for work.

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provided an overview of the current data on COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, and deaths. She emphasized that while the vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death, the Delta variant is highly contagious and can result in higher viral loads even in vaccinated individuals. She mentioned a recent outbreak in Massachusetts where fully vaccinated individuals had similar viral loads to those who were unvaccinated.

Walensky explained that the updated CDC guidance, including the recommendation for vaccinated individuals to wear masks in public indoor settings in areas with substantial or high transmission, is based on the evolving understanding of the Delta variant and its ability to transmit, even among vaccinated individuals. She reiterated the importance of vaccines in preventing severe illness and hospitalization and emphasized the need for everyone over the age of 12 to get vaccinated.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Chief Medical Advisor to the President, discussed the real-world effectiveness of vaccines against the Delta variant. He presented data showing that the vaccines provide strong protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. He also addressed the issue of breakthrough infections, explaining that while they can occur, they are relatively rare and usually result in mild or asymptomatic cases.

In response to questions, Zients mentioned that the federal government is open to implementing more requirements for vaccination, particularly in the healthcare setting. He highlighted the steps taken by the government to make it more difficult for unvaccinated individuals to return to work and mentioned the vaccine requirements already in place at the Department of Veterans Affairs. He also noted the growing trend of vaccine requirements in the private sector, universities, and health systems.

Overall, the briefing emphasized the importance of vaccination in controlling the spread of the Delta variant and preventing severe illness. It also addressed concerns about breakthrough infections and provided updates on the government's efforts to increase vaccination rates and protect the workforce.
