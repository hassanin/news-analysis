National Hurricane Preparedness Week is a proclamation by the President of the United States to raise awareness about the importance of preparing for hurricanes. The proclamation highlights the devastating effects of hurricanes, such as severe flooding, storm surges, high winds, and tornadoes. It emphasizes the need for individuals, businesses, and families to create emergency plans, prepare supply kits, and learn evacuation routes. The proclamation also calls for a community-oriented approach to disaster management that includes all levels of government, private sector, volunteers, and the public. The goal is to save lives and reduce the damage caused by hurricanes.
