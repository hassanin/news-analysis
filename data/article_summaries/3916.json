The White House Competition Council, consisting of eight cabinet members and leaders of seven independent agencies, held its inaugural meeting to discuss actions to boost competition and lower prices for American families. The council was established through an executive order to promote competition in the American economy. The council's mandate includes delivering on 72 initiatives, collaborating on addressing competition problems, and benefiting consumers, workers, farmers, and small businesses. NEC Director Brian Deese, chair of the council, highlighted the importance of the competition agenda in the administration's plan to Build Back Better. Council members were briefed on efforts to bolster competition in key industries and two new members were welcomed. The council aims to restore competition in American capitalism and identify new ways to promote competition.
