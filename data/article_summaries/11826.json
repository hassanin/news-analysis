The United States is committed to managing nuclear smuggling incidents, both domestically and internationally. They have a Counter Nuclear Smuggling (CNS) Team that is equipped to respond quickly and effectively to such incidents. Various federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy, and Department of Defense, are involved in this effort. They also collaborate with state, local, and tribal governments, as well as the private sector, other countries, and international organizations. The FBI plays a crucial role in strengthening law enforcement response and coordinating investigations of nuclear smuggling threats and incidents within the United States. They have established the Radiological Nuclear Search Operations (RNSO) framework to coordinate the response of relevant government agencies. The FBI also works with international partners, utilizing their network of Legal Attachés and WMD Assistant Legal Attachés to develop leads and cooperate with foreign counterparts. The United States encourages other countries to enhance their capabilities to investigate smuggling networks and apprehend perpetrators. They have signed agreements and conducted workshops to improve counter nuclear smuggling capacity worldwide. The Department of State negotiates joint action plans with key countries, while the Department of Energy provides detection systems and training. The Department of Defense secures vulnerable nuclear material and provides equipment and training. The United States also supports the INTERPOL CBRNE Sub-Directorate and participates in Operation Fail Safe, an information-sharing tool to track the illicit trafficking of radioactive or nuclear materials.
