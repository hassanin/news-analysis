The White House held a teleconference with White House spokesperson Ian Sams to provide updates on the ongoing investigation into documents found at the Biden Center and President Biden's residence. The White House Counsel sent a letter to the Chairman of the House Oversight Committee explaining that the White House does not have possession of the documents and stressed the importance of protecting the integrity of law enforcement investigations. President Biden's personal lawyer released a statement disclosing a voluntary DOJ search of the President's residence, which lasted 13 hours and resulted in the seizure of documents. The President offered DOJ access to his home voluntarily. The Department of Justice confirmed that the search was consensual. Questions from journalists during the teleconference focused on who is paying the President's personal attorney, whether the President was surprised by the presence of classified materials in his home, and the number and nature of the documents seized. The White House referred journalists to the President's personal attorney and the Department of Justice for specific information on those matters. The White House emphasized its full cooperation with DOJ and its commitment to protecting the integrity of the investigation.
