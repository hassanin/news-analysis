According to The New York Post, one in five New Yorkers can expect double-digit rate hikes for their Obamacare policies. This amounts to approximately 3.6 million people. Obamacare has been experiencing a decline for several years, with insurance giants like United and Aetna pulling out of many markets. In response to the collapse of Obamacare, Republicans are working on healthcare reform to provide affordable and quality coverage to Americans. In New York, health insurers are expected to request double-digit rate hikes for 2018 Obamacare policies, following similar trends in neighboring states like Connecticut, Maryland, and Virginia. It is estimated that 18 percent of New Yorkers, or nearly one in five, obtain health insurance through Obamacare.
