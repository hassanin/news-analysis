This article discusses the efforts of the Obama administration to address food security in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2009, President Obama made global food security a foreign policy priority and launched the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition. The New Alliance aims to lift 50 million people out of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa by 2022 through policy reforms, targeted assistance, and private sector investments. Over the past year, private sector companies have pledged over $3.7 billion in investments in New Alliance countries. Progress has already been made, with countries like Ghana, Tanzania, and Ethiopia implementing key policy reforms and seeing improvements in agriculture and food processing. The New Alliance also emphasizes accountability through regular progress reports and the establishment of a Leadership Council. Additionally, the article highlights other initiatives such as Feed the Future, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and multilateral partnerships that contribute to food security in Africa. The United States has been mobilizing the international community, investing in agricultural development, and promoting access to agricultural data and technology to improve food security in the region.
