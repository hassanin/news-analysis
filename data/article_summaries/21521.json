On August 7, 2014, the President signed into law H.R. 3230, also known as the "Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014." This act introduces new measures and amends current Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) authorities related to veteran health care provided by non-VA providers, improved access to care and health care administration, major medical facility leases, and veterans benefits matters.
