In the wake of a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, Vice President Harris has been briefed by the homeland security team. This incident is just one in a series of tragic shootings, including those in Atlanta, Boulder, Rock Hill, and other locations. While awaiting further details about the shooting, Vice President Harris has ordered the flag to be lowered at half-staff at the White House, public buildings, military posts, and embassies. This is the second time in two weeks that such an order has been given. The Vice President emphasizes that gun violence is an epidemic in America and calls for action. She has called on the Justice Department to protect Americans from gun violence and urges Congress to pass common-sense gun violence prevention legislation, such as universal background checks and a ban on weapons of war and high-capacity magazines. Vice President Harris expresses her condolences to the families of the eight victims in Indianapolis and prays for the recovery of the wounded.
