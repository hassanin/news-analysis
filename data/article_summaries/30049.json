On July 29, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum granting a Presidential permit to NuStar Logistics, L.P. The permit allows NuStar Logistics to construct, operate, and maintain pipeline Border facilities at the international border of the United States and Mexico in Hidalgo County, Texas. The permit grants permission for the transport of all hydrocarbons and petroleum products between the two countries, except for natural gas subject to section 3 of the Natural Gas Act. The permit supersedes and revokes a previous permit issued to NuStar Logistics on June 28, 2017. The permit includes conditions that the Border facilities must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and grants the United States the right to enter and take possession of the facilities for national security purposes. The permittee is responsible for acquiring necessary permits and authorizations, and must hold harmless and indemnify the United States from any liability arising from the operation of the facilities. The permittee must also provide information and reports to the President and appropriate agencies, and notify the President of construction activities. The permit is valid for 10 years from the date of issuance unless construction of the Border facilities has not commenced by that date. The permit does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States.
