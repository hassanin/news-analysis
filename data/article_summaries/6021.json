President Biden is taking action to expand access to legal representation and the courts. He believes that timely and affordable access to the legal system can have a significant impact on people's lives, such as keeping them out of poverty, helping them stay in their homes, assisting unaccompanied children seeking asylum, fighting consumer scams, and ensuring individuals charged with crimes receive a fair trial. Low-income individuals have historically faced challenges in accessing quality legal services, and these challenges have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The federal government has a crucial role to play in addressing these issues and supporting civil legal aid providers and public defenders. 

President Biden's executive action includes several key directives. The Attorney General has been instructed to submit a plan within 120 days to expand the Department of Justice's access to justice work, which was previously diminished during the prior administration. The administration will also re-establish the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable, which aims to prioritize civil legal aid and expand access to federal programs. This roundtable will be co-chaired by the Attorney General and the Counsel to the President, or their representatives, and will convene federal agencies to address the most pressing legal services challenges, including those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. These actions align with the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to protect vulnerable Americans, reform the justice system, and advance racial equity.
