President Biden has issued a memorandum directing the expansion of the federal government's role in expanding access to justice. The memorandum calls for the Department of Justice to submit a report outlining its plan to expand access to justice, and it re-establishes the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable to address legal services challenges, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biden-Harris Administration is releasing reports on these initiatives as part of its efforts to protect vulnerable Americans, reform the justice system, and advance racial equity. This action builds on previous efforts to prioritize equity and reform the criminal justice system.
