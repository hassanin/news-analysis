President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Colorado and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts from the High Park and Waldo Canyon Fires. The declaration provides federal funding for emergency protective measures and assistance to individuals affected by the fires in El Paso and Larimer Counties. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will coordinate recovery operations in the affected area, and further assessments may result in additional assistance being designated for other counties.
