The Obama Administration has introduced a "Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights" to protect individual privacy rights and give users more control over their personal information. The bill of rights aims to prevent misuse of information by providing users with legal and technical tools to safeguard their privacy. The plan includes the development of enforceable codes of conduct by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in collaboration with internet companies and consumer advocates. The Federal Trade Commission will enforce these codes of conduct. The administration also plans to work with Congress to enact comprehensive privacy legislation. The initiative emphasizes the importance of privacy in the internet age and aims to establish privacy practices that meet global standards. The plan also focuses on achieving privacy policies for a global, open internet and increasing interoperability between the US data privacy framework and those of trading partners. The administration encourages industry action to implement the Individual Control principle by using Do Not Track technology to allow users to control online tracking. The plan also highlights the need for transparency, respect for context, security, access and accuracy, focused collection, and accountability in handling personal data. The administration believes that implementing these principles will protect consumers while ensuring the flexibility necessary for continued innovation in the internet economy.
