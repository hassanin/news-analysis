The article discusses the passage of the Southwest Border Security Bill and the efforts made by the Obama administration to secure the Southwest border and combat transnational criminal organizations. The bill provides $600 million in supplemental funds for enhanced border protection and law enforcement activities. It also authorizes the deployment of up to 1,200 National Guard troops to provide support in counternarcotics enforcement. The article highlights the unprecedented resources already dedicated to securing the border, such as doubling the personnel assigned to Border Enforcement Security Task Forces, increasing technology assets, and increasing cooperation with U.S. and Mexican law enforcement. These efforts have resulted in significant seizures of illegal currency, drugs, and firearms, as well as a reduction in illegal immigration.
