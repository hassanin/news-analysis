President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has submitted a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia will continue beyond October 21, 2023. The President believes that the circumstances that led to the declaration of the national emergency in 1995 have not been resolved. The actions of these narcotics traffickers pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, as well as causing violence, corruption, and harm domestically and internationally. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency. The notice has been sent to the Federal Register for publication.
