President Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 1, 2016, as Law Day, U.S.A. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's ruling in Miranda v. Arizona, which established the practice of informing individuals of their constitutional rights prior to police interrogation. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of equal justice under the law and the need for criminal justice reform. President Obama highlights the work of his Task Force on 21st Century Policing in strengthening relationships between law enforcement and communities. The proclamation also calls for civic education programs to ensure citizens are aware of their constitutional rights. President Obama encourages all Americans to acknowledge the significance of the nation's legal and judicial systems and to display the flag in support of Law Day.
