This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on January 31, 2014. The memorandum is titled "Certification Concerning U.S. Participation in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali Consistent with Section 2005 of the American Servicemembers' Protection Act." 

The memorandum states that the President, in accordance with section 2005 of the American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002, certifies that members of the U.S. Armed Forces participating in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali are not at risk of criminal prosecution or other assertion of jurisdiction by the International Criminal Court (ICC). This is because the Republic of Mali has entered into an agreement, as per Article 98 of the Rome Statute, which prevents the ICC from proceeding against members of the U.S. Armed Forces present in the country.

The Secretary of State is directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
