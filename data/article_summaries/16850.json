President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New Jersey due to Hurricane Sandy and has ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in eight counties: Atlantic, Cape May, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, and Union. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Michael J. Hall has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are still ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated later. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by calling the toll-free telephone numbers provided.
