President Obama has vetoed H.R. 3762, a bill that would repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In his veto message, the President argues that the ACA has made significant progress in improving healthcare in America, including making coverage more affordable and attainable, and increasing patient-centered care. He cites statistics such as 17.6 million Americans gaining healthcare coverage and the lowest uninsured rate ever. The President claims that the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 22 million after 2017, potentially leading to hundreds of thousands of people not receiving needed care, higher medical costs for millions, and thousands of additional deaths. He also argues that the bill would jeopardize the health coverage of 150 million Americans with employer-based insurance and cause the cost of health coverage for individuals to skyrocket. Additionally, the President criticizes the bill for effectively defunding Planned Parenthood, limiting access to healthcare for men, women, and families, especially low-income individuals. The President concludes by urging Members of Congress to focus on growing the economy, strengthening middle-class families, and creating new jobs instead of repealing the ACA.
