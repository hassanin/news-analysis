During a White House COVID Response briefing, Acting Administrator Slavitt provided updates on the country's efforts to defeat COVID-19. He highlighted the progress in vaccinations, with nearly one in five adults and nearly half of Americans over 65 having received their first shot. He also emphasized the importance of the American Rescue Plan, which will provide funding for various COVID-19 response efforts such as making schools safer, testing and tracing, addressing supply shortages, and providing relief to hard-hit communities.

Slavitt announced a new partnership with leading business organizations to enlist the private sector in the fight against COVID-19. The call to action asks businesses to require masking and social distancing, reduce barriers to vaccinations for employees, and communicate the benefits of masking and vaccinations to customers. Several companies have already taken action, such as producing and donating masks, providing paid time off for vaccinations, and offering free rides to vaccination sites.

Dr. Walensky expressed concern about the recent stalling of COVID-19 declines, with cases and hospital admissions increasing in the past three days. She emphasized the need to continue public health measures and not relax restrictions, especially with the presence of more contagious variants. Dr. Fauci provided an update on vaccine efforts, including ongoing studies on variant-specific vaccines. He stressed the importance of getting vaccinated and the need to bring down cases and test positivity rates to approach a more normal state.

Overall, the briefing emphasized the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, the progress made in vaccinations, and the importance of continued efforts to control the spread of the virus.
