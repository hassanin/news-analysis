President Donald J. Trump has released the United States Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security, which aims to increase women's participation in political, civic, and security endeavors to prevent and resolve conflicts, as well as create conditions for long-term peace worldwide. The strategy seeks to ensure that women are not absent from or overlooked at the negotiating table and modernizes international programs to improve equality and empowerment for women. The United States is the first country with a standalone, comprehensive law on Women, Peace, and Security, thanks to bipartisan legislation signed by President Trump. This strategy is in line with the Trump Administration's commitment to empowering women in economic and security fields, as seen through initiatives like the White House Women's Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative. The release of this strategy reaffirms the United States' commitment to advancing women's equality, protecting their rights, and promoting their economic empowerment.
