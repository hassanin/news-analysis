The article discusses the Obama Administration's commitment to upgrading the U.S. food safety system. The Food Safety Working Group, created by President Obama in March, has recommended a new, public health-focused approach to food safety based on three core principles: prioritizing prevention, strengthening surveillance and enforcement, and improving response and recovery. The Working Group has announced specific steps to advance these principles, including targeting salmonella contamination, stepping up enforcement in beef facilities, and developing new industry guidance for leafy greens, melons, and tomatoes. The Administration is also working on building a new national traceback and response system and strengthening the organization of federal food safety functions.
