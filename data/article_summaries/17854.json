Vice President Joe Biden has commended the increased transparency on Recovery.gov, a website that provides information on how Recovery Act funds are being used. The website now includes interactive maps that show how the funds are being distributed to states, contractors, grantees, and other recipients. Biden praises the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board for utilizing technology to give the public access to information on how their taxpayer dollars are being spent. The maps allow visitors to view the amount of money provided to each state, the amount being put to work, and the amount actually paid out. The maps also provide information on how the funds are being distributed to contractors, grantees, and loan recipients, allowing sorting by state, amount, and federal agency.
