On October 19, 2012, the President signed into law S. 3624, also known as the "Military Commercial Driver's License Act of 2012." This law allows states to issue commercial driver's licenses to members of the Armed Forces who are stationed in a state but are not residents of that state. This law ensures that these members of the military can obtain a commercial driver's license without the state losing federal funding for certain federal highway programs.
