President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring April 7, 2011, as National D.A.R.E. Day. The purpose of this day is to raise awareness about the importance of preventing drug abuse and promoting a drug-free lifestyle, especially among young Americans. Substance abuse has severe consequences for individuals and society, including destroying lives, tearing apart families, and contributing to violence in communities. The proclamation emphasizes the need for parents, friends, mentors, teachers, and neighbors to play a role in educating young people about the dangers of drug addiction and encouraging positive behavior. The Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) program is highlighted as a resource for educating young people on resisting peer pressure and avoiding drug use and violence. The administration is committed to reducing drug use through a balanced approach that includes prevention, treatment, and law enforcement. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe National D.A.R.E. Day with appropriate programs and activities.
