The President is signing a presidential memorandum to establish the first-ever White House Initiative on Women's Health Research. This initiative aims to address the underrepresentation of women in health research and the lack of funding for such research. All government agencies involved in health will be required to report on their current efforts and suggestions for improving women's health within 45 days. The First Lady expresses gratitude to those who brought attention to this issue and acknowledges the President's willingness to listen and take action. The President expresses his commitment to solving the imbalances in women's health research. When asked about a potential government shutdown, the President states that negotiations are ongoing and he does not yet know the outcome. He declines to make a judgment on what he would veto or sign. The President also expresses concerns about the situation in Gaza and hopes for less intrusive action and the protection of a hospital.
