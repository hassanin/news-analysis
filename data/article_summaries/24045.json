President Barack Obama will be awarding Chief Master Sergeant Richard L. Etchberger, U.S. Air Force, the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions in combat on March 11, 1968, in Laos. Chief Etchberger displayed immeasurable courage and uncommon valor by deliberately exposing himself to enemy fire in order to rescue his three wounded comrades. Unfortunately, he was fatally wounded by enemy ground fire during the rescue. His sons will join the President at the White House to honor their father's selfless service and sacrifice. Chief Etchberger served in the Air Force from 1951 to 1968 and held various assignments around the world. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who demonstrate gallantry above and beyond the call of duty, involving great personal bravery or self-sacrifice.
