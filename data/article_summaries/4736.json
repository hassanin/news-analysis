The White House is set to release a national security study memorandum (NSSM) on the fight against corruption, marking the first NSSM of the Biden administration. The memorandum establishes the fight against corruption as a core national security interest and directs federal departments and agencies to enhance their anti-corruption efforts. The memorandum focuses on modernizing, coordinating, and providing resources for anti-corruption initiatives, including efforts to combat illicit finance, hold corrupt actors accountable, and build international partnerships. The administration aims to accelerate and prioritize its anti-corruption agenda, building upon existing efforts such as the Corporate Transparency Act, the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, and increased anti-corruption work by the Department of Justice, the State Department, and USAID. The administration also plans to engage with international allies and utilize various tools, including the intelligence community and sanctions, to combat corruption.
