On February 11, 2022, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the humanitarian crisis and economic collapse in Afghanistan. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The ongoing humanitarian crisis, including the urgent needs of the Afghan people for basic necessities such as food, water, health, and shelter, as well as the potential for a further economic collapse, continue to pose a significant threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Additionally, the preservation of certain assets of the Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) held in the United States by US financial institutions is crucial for addressing this national emergency and supporting the welfare of the Afghan people. Some parties, including representatives of terrorism victims, have claimed legal rights to these assets. As a result, Executive Order 14064, which blocks the property of DAB, needs to remain in effect beyond February 11, 2023. In accordance with the National Emergencies Act, President Biden has decided to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14064 for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
