President Obama has signed the Inspectors General Empowerment Act of 2016, which aims to ensure that government is open and accountable. This legislation allows Inspectors General to have access to the information they need to perform their duties, while also protecting the privacy and civil liberties of Americans. The Act emphasizes the commitment to transparency in government, which has been a priority of the Obama Administration throughout his presidency.
