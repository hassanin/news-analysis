The U.S. Supreme Court has made a decision that will limit the right to vote, particularly for voters of color. This is the second time in the past eight years that the Court has weakened protections of the Voting Rights Act. Justice Elena Kagan, in her dissent, described the Act as representing both the best and worst of America, as it is necessary to combat voter discrimination. Congress must now take action, as they did almost 40 years ago, to strengthen the Voting Rights Act in order to protect our democracy.
