The President has announced that federal student loan repayments will be paused until August 31, 2022. This measure aims to help 41 million people manage their monthly bills and meet basic needs, while also giving borrowers time to prepare for repayment. The announcement is personal for the President, as he had student loans himself. As the former California Attorney General, he fought against predatory for-profit colleges and secured $1 billion for defrauded veterans and students. The President and Vice President understand the stress that student loan debt can cause for borrowers and their families. This announcement is seen as a meaningful step forward as the country continues to recover from the pandemic and economic downturn.
