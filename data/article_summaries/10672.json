During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest discussed several topics including the reversal on oil drilling on the Atlantic Coast, Russia's decision to pull out some of its troops from Syria, and the President's comments on the campaign trail. Earnest explained that the decision on Atlantic drilling was based on conflicts raised by the Department of Defense, concerns from commercial interests and coastal communities, and an assessment of current energy market dynamics. He also stated that Russia did not give direct advance notice of its decision to pull out troops from Syria, and that the President's reaction to this announcement will depend on how Russia follows through with its commitment to engage constructively in political talks. Earnest also discussed the President's comments on the campaign trail, emphasizing the need for leaders to condemn divisive and vulgar rhetoric. He acknowledged that in the past, the President may have made intemperate remarks, but he believes that there is a difference between those remarks and the current rhetoric being used by some Republican candidates. Finally, Earnest mentioned that the administration is still working on making a determination of whether ISIS's actions constitute genocide.
