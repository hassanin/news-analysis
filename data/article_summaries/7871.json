In a speech at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized the need for global cooperation in preparing for future biological threats. She acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed flaws in our systems and highlighted the interconnectedness and interdependence of the world. Harris called for a new financing mechanism to ensure that nations are fully prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to future pandemics. She announced that the United States is prepared to contribute at least $250 million to start a new Financial Intermediary Fund at the World Bank and has requested an additional $850 million from Congress. The goal is to reach $10 billion in funding, which is a fraction of a percent of global GDP. Harris also stressed the importance of transparency and accountability in meeting global health obligations and supported the establishment of a Global Health Threats Council to monitor progress and identify gaps. She expressed confidence that, by working together, a future with strong and resilient health systems and the ability to stop biological threats before they start is possible.
