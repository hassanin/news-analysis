This article is a Presidential Proclamation issued by President Barack Obama on June 26, 2014. The proclamation discusses the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the designation of certain countries as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries. 

In the proclamation, President Obama mentions that he had previously terminated the designation of Madagascar as a beneficiary country due to lack of progress in meeting the requirements set forth in the AGOA. However, based on actions taken by the Government of Madagascar, he has now determined that Madagascar meets the eligibility requirements and has decided to designate it as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country again.

On the other hand, President Obama also states that the Kingdom of Swaziland is not making continual progress in meeting the requirements described in the AGOA, and therefore, he has decided to terminate its designation as a beneficiary country, effective from January 1, 2015.

The proclamation includes modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to reflect the designation of Madagascar as a beneficiary country and the termination of Swaziland's designation. It also states that any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded.

The proclamation is signed by President Barack Obama.
