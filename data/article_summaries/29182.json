This article is a transcript of remarks made by President Trump during a ceremony commemorating the return of Native American artifacts and sacred remains to the United States. The artifacts, which were excavated from Colorado by European archaeologists nearly 130 years ago, were returned to 26 Indian tribes of the Mesa Verde region in the American Southwest. The President thanked the Finnish Ambassador and the government of Finland for their efforts in making the repatriation possible. He also highlighted his administration's commitment to working with tribal leaders to honor and preserve Native American heritage. Additionally, the President mentioned the investments made in Indian Country, including $8 billion in CARES Act funds for Native American health and the creation of task forces on missing and murdered American Indians and protecting Native American children. The President commended the progress made in addressing these issues and thanked the Department of Interior Secretary, David Bernhardt, and Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, Tara Sweeney, for their work.
