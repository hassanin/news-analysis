President Obama has announced plans to expand the "Race to the Top" program, which aims to reform and improve public schools in the United States. The President will request $1.35 billion for the program in the fiscal year 2011 budget. The plan includes additional incentives for states to modify and implement education reform plans in order to qualify for program grants. It also expands the program to include school districts that are ready to make system-level improvements in their education policies and practices. The continuation of Race to the Top is part of a broader education reform plan that the Administration will unveil in the coming weeks. The plan also includes the continuation of the Invest in Innovation fund, which complements Race to the Top. The goal of Race to the Top is to raise standards by having the best teachers and principals, basing teacher evaluations on student performance, addressing underperforming schools, and preparing students for success in the 21st-century economy. The program has received overwhelming response from over 30 states in the first round of funding. It aims to establish and implement rigorous standards and assessments, attract and retain high-quality teachers and leaders, use data to inform decision-making and improve teaching, use innovative strategies to transform struggling schools, and promote collaboration between business leaders, educators, and other stakeholders to improve student performance and close achievement gaps.
