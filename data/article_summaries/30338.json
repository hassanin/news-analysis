President Trump has issued a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the threat of foreign interference in United States elections will continue beyond September 12, 2019. The notice highlights that although there has been no evidence of a foreign power altering election outcomes, foreign powers have historically sought to exploit America's political system. The proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has increased vulnerabilities and intensified the threat. The ability of individuals outside the US to interfere in elections or undermine public confidence through unauthorized accessing of election infrastructure or the distribution of propaganda and disinformation continues to pose a significant threat to national security and foreign policy. Therefore, President Trump has determined it necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13848.
