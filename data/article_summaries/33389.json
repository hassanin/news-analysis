President Donald J. Trump has expressed his condolences to President Emmanuel Macron of France for the fire that devastated the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. The United States stands in solidarity with the French citizens, the city of Paris, and the millions of visitors who have found solace in this iconic structure. The Cathedral, which has been a spiritual home for almost a millennium, represents France's freedom of religion and democracy. The United States remembers the tolling of Notre Dame's bells on September 12, 2001, in recognition of the tragic September 11th attacks. The US pledges its assistance in the restoration of this symbol of Western civilization.
