President Donald J. Trump has signed a waiver under the Jerusalem Embassy Act, delaying the move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, this should not be seen as a retreat from his strong support for Israel and the United States-Israel alliance. The decision was made in order to increase the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between Israel and the Palestinians. President Trump has repeatedly stated his intention to move the embassy, so the question is not if it will happen, but when.
