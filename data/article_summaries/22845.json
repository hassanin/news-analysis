In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims January 2011 as National Mentoring Month. He highlights the importance of mentors in guiding and supporting young people, and encourages more Americans to become mentors in their communities. Mentors play a crucial role in helping young individuals reach their full potential and succeed in life. They provide guidance, share knowledge and experiences, and can have a lasting impact on a child's development. Mentoring programs have been shown to improve school attendance, student attitudes, and reduce drug and alcohol use. The Federal Government is working to expand mentoring opportunities, particularly in Native American and rural communities, and to ensure investments are focused on those most in need. President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have also established mentoring programs within the White House. The President calls upon public officials, business and community leaders, educators, and all Americans to observe National Mentoring Month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
