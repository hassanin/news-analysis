President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on November 9, 2019, highlighting the strong economy of the United States and the opportunities it has created for Americans. He emphasized his administration's efforts in reducing tax burdens and eliminating unnecessary regulations, resulting in the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years and an excess of job openings for 19 consecutive months. The administration is committed to helping Americans take advantage of this job market by providing access to skills-training programs for successful careers in any industry. National Apprenticeship Week was observed to celebrate workers' optimism and empower them to achieve the American Dream. The administration has made significant investments in apprenticeships, allocating over $300 million this year. These investments include grants to encourage partnerships in high-growth industries and expanding the number of apprentices in Registered Apprenticeship programs across the country. Apprenticeships offer workplace and classroom education, providing valuable knowledge and credentials while avoiding student loans. They also benefit American companies by providing them with skilled employees for growth and innovation. The administration is encouraging business leaders, industry experts, and educational institutions to expand apprenticeship programs and invest in the education and skills training of their workers. The Pledge to America's Workers has garnered commitments from over 360 companies to invest in over 14 million students and workers. The administration is also developing standards for industry-recognized apprenticeship programs and supporting the growth of youth apprenticeship programs. The proclamation concludes with a commitment to fostering greater opportunity for workers by supporting expanded access to apprenticeships and strengthening the nation's workforce.
