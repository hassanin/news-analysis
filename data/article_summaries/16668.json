The President received the Secretary of State's recommendation on the Keystone XL Pipeline. The Secretary of State recommended that the application be denied due to the rushed and arbitrary deadline set by Congressional Republicans, which prevented a full assessment of the pipeline's impact on health, safety, and the environment. The President agrees with this recommendation. The announcement is not a judgment on the merits of the pipeline, but on the arbitrary deadline. The President is disappointed that Republicans forced this decision but remains committed to American-made energy that creates jobs and reduces oil dependence. The Administration will continue to partner with the oil and gas industry to increase energy security while setting higher efficiency standards and investing in alternatives like biofuels and natural gas. The focus will be on benefiting American workers and businesses without risking the health, safety, and environment.
