The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a statement on July 26, 2013, stating that the United States is determined to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. The Department of Defense has certified its intent to repatriate two detainees to Algeria, in consultation with Congress and in a manner that protects national security. The statement calls on Congress to lift current restrictions that limit the ability to transfer detainees out of Guantanamo, including those who have been approved for transfer.
