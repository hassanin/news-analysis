President Obama has announced the ConnectALL initiative, which aims to provide broadband and access to technology for all Americans. The initiative includes a recommendation to reform a $1.5 billion per year phone subsidy program into a national broadband subsidy for low-income Americans. The Administration is also calling for a national effort to connect 20 million more Americans to broadband by 2020. The ConnectALL initiative builds on the progress made in expanding broadband over the past seven years, but acknowledges that more work needs to be done to ensure that all Americans can access the economic benefits of broadband, especially low-income households. The initiative includes increasing the affordability of broadband, delivering digital literacy skills through a pilot project, increasing access to affordable devices, developing a tool to support broadband planning, and collaborating with private sector companies and philanthropic organizations.
