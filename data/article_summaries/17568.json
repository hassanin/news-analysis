President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566 of February 25, 2011, with respect to Libya, is to continue beyond February 25, 2016. The letter highlights the extreme measures taken by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates against the people of Libya, including the use of weapons of war, mercenaries, and violence against unarmed civilians. It also mentions the risk of misappropriation of Libyan state assets and the deterioration of Libya's security and stability. The letter states that the Libyan Presidency Council is attempting to form a Government of National Accord (GNA), while holdouts from the General National Congress continue to compete for control of Libya's resources. The presence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya and attacks targeting Libyans and their oil infrastructure are also mentioned. The letter emphasizes the need for dialogue, the formation of a GNA, and the cessation of violence, and highlights the importance of maintaining appropriate sanctions to protect Libya's democratic transition. President Obama determines that the situation in Libya continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States and that the national emergency with respect to Libya should be continued.
