President Obama has directed the establishment of the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force, which aims to accelerate progress in cancer research and treatment. The Task Force will focus on maximizing federal investments, private sector efforts, patient engagement initiatives, and other mechanisms to support cancer research. The Vice President will serve as the Chair of the Task Force, and it will consist of heads of executive branch departments and agencies. The Task Force's mission includes accelerating understanding of cancer, improving patient access and care, supporting greater access to research and data, encouraging development of cancer treatments, addressing regulatory barriers, and identifying opportunities for public-private partnerships. The Task Force will conduct outreach and engage in transparency and reporting. The memorandum emphasizes that the implementation of the Task Force will be consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
