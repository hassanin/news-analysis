This article is a notice from the White House announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Belarus. The national emergency was initially declared in 2006 due to the actions and policies of certain members of the Belarusian government and other individuals that undermined Belarus's democratic processes and institutions. These actions included undemocratic elections, human rights abuses, and public corruption. The article states that the threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by these actions and policies still persists, and therefore, the national emergency declaration must continue in effect. The notice is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, and it will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
