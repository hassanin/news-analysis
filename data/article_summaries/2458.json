The United Auto Workers (UAW) has welcomed the newest members at the Ultium Cells LLC EV battery plant in Warren, Ohio. The President ran with the goal of rebuilding the middle class, which he believes is the backbone of America, with unions playing a crucial role. The administration's economic plan aims to create well-paying jobs that can support families, even without a college degree, and give workers the choice to join a union freely. By investing in infrastructure and manufacturing electric vehicle batteries and semi-conductors, these jobs will help bring supply chains back to the US and address the climate crisis. The President envisions American and union workers leading the world in manufacturing once again.
