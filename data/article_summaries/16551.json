The Vice President's Annual Report to the President on Progress Implementing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 highlights the positive impact of the act on the economy. The report states that the ARRA added between 2 to 3 percentage points to real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2009, between 3 and 4 percentage points in the third quarter, and between 1.5 and 3 percentage points in the fourth quarter. It also shows that payroll job losses are lessening and unemployment insurance claims have been declining since March 2009. The report states that ARRA had created or saved over 1 million jobs by September 2009, and up to 2.4 million jobs supported according to the Congressional Budget Office. The report emphasizes the pace of spending, with ARRA funds being quickly moved into the economy and exceeding the Congressional Budget Office's original projection. Looking forward, the report sets a goal to disburse 70 percent of Recovery Act funds by September 30, 2010, and states that they are on track to achieve this goal. It also highlights a shift in the mix of spending towards projects in 2010, with monthly project outlays expected to more than double compared to the 2009 average. The report concludes by mentioning the upcoming signature projects, such as High Speed Rail, Health IT, and Broadband grants.
