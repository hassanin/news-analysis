The German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is scheduled to visit Washington and the White House tomorrow. President Biden is looking forward to welcoming Chancellor Scholz on his first visit to Washington as head of state. The leaders are expected to discuss various topics, including the situation in Ukraine and Russia, the German presidency of the G7, global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, the Western Balkans, and China's nonmarket economic practices and human rights abuses. The United States and Germany have been coordinating closely on the imposition of sanctions on Russia if there is further aggression. The issue of Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline project between Russia and Germany, is also likely to be discussed. The US has made it clear that if Russia invades Ukraine, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward. Germany has been supportive of US efforts on deterrence and diplomacy and has suspended the certification process of Nord Stream 2. The US and Germany reached an agreement on the operationality of Nord Stream 2 in July 2021, and this agreement is still viewed as operative by both countries.
