President Biden spoke at SUNY Westchester Community College in Valhalla, New York, addressing the current debate in Congress over the debt ceiling and the budget. He criticized the "MAGA Republicans" for threatening to default on the nation's debt unless their demands are met. He outlined the potential consequences of such a default, including job losses, economic recession, and damage to America's international reputation. He also highlighted the importance of investing in infrastructure, reducing the deficit, and making the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share in taxes. President Biden emphasized the need to protect programs for working and middle-class Americans, such as Medicaid, veterans' healthcare, and education. He called for bipartisan cooperation and urged Republicans to support his efforts to strengthen the economy and address the needs of the American people.
