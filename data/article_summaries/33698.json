President Donald J. Trump has signed into law H.R. 5509, the "Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act." However, he has expressed concerns about Section 5(b) of the Act, which requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to submit a report to Congress and the public containing legislative recommendations for optimizing the effectiveness of certain grant programs. The President intends to interpret this provision in line with Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, which grants the President the discretion to recommend measures that they deem necessary and expedient to Congress.
