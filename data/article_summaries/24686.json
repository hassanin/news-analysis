The United States is deeply concerned about the ongoing violence in Southern Kordofan, Sudan. The fighting between the Sudanese government forces and the Sudan People's Liberation Army threatens peace efforts in the region. The US condemns the violence targeting individuals based on ethnicity and political affiliation and calls for a full investigation into these incidents. They demand that the perpetrators stop their actions and be held accountable for their crimes. The government of Sudan is urged to cease its pursuit of a military solution and agree to a ceasefire. The US also calls for the leaders of the Sudan People's Liberation Army to avoid reprisals and cooperate with UN investigations. The grave violations of international humanitarian law will negatively impact Sudan's relationship with the international community.
