In this statement, the President expresses his concern over the Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United, which allows big corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence American elections without disclosing their donors. The President argues that this decision gives special interests unprecedented influence over politicians and is harmful to democracy. He criticizes Republicans in the Senate for blocking a bill that would require groups and special interests to reveal their donors, stating that they sided with big banks and oil companies instead of the American people. The President pledges to continue working to rebuild trust between Washington and the American people and expresses disappointment in the lack of action by Republicans in Congress.
