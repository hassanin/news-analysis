President Biden has announced that $95 million will be provided through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to strengthen Hawai ªi's power grid and improve its resilience against future storms. This funding will be used to reinforce critical transmission lines, replace wooden poles with fire-resistant material, deploy intelligent switches to reduce wildfire risk, and relocate the Maui control center to a more secure location. The administration is committed to supporting the people of Maui in their recovery and rebuilding efforts, while respecting sacred lands, cultures, and traditions. More than 1,000 federal personnel are currently on the ground in Maui to assist with response efforts. The administration encourages individuals impacted by the disaster to register for federal assistance and visit FEMA's Disaster Recovery Centers for additional support services and resources.
