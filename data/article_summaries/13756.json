President Obama was briefed on federal preparations for the upcoming hurricane season and FEMA's disaster management approach. The briefing included input from state, local, non-profit, faith-based, and private sector partners. Last year, FEMA worked with these entities to support North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue and her emergency management team during Hurricane Earl. The President stressed the importance of a team approach and directed Secretary Napolitano and Administrator Fugate to continue building on this model. The list of attendees at the meeting is also provided.
