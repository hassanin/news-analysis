President Obama announced the winners of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching. The award is given annually to the top math and science teachers in the country. This year, 103 teachers were honored, and they will receive a cash prize of $10,000 from the National Science Foundation. They will also be invited to a ceremony in Washington, D.C., where they will participate in educational events and meet with members of Congress and leaders in scientific agencies. The President's "Educate to Innovate" program aims to improve science, technology, engineering, and math education in the United States. The program has generated over $500 million in donations and support from corporations and philanthropic organizations.
