President Biden campaigned on a strong commitment to addressing the climate crisis, and he has followed through on his promises since taking office. He rejoined the Paris Agreement, restored scientific integrity, and revitalized US leadership on the global stage. He set ambitious goals, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. He also established the National Climate Task Force to drive action towards these goals.

In addition to executive actions, President Biden made climate action and environmental justice a key part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This law includes significant federal investments in upgrading the power grid, improving public transit, investing in zero-emission transit and school buses, establishing a nationwide EV charging network, addressing legacy pollution, delivering clean water, demonstrating innovative climate technologies, and increasing climate resilience.

President Biden recognizes the need for even faster action and calls on Congress to enact a legislative agenda for clean energy and climate action. He emphasizes the benefits of investments and tax credits for domestic clean energy manufacturing and deployment, which would lower energy costs for American families by an average of $500 per year.

While working with Congress, President Biden continues to take bold and decisive actions to address the climate crisis. This includes actions taken in the first two months of 2022. These actions build on the historic progress made during his first year in office, including rejoining the Paris Agreement and setting ambitious goals for emissions reduction and clean energy deployment.
