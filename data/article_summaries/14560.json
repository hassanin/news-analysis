The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a statement in support of H.R. 3962, the Affordable Health Care for America Act. The bill aims to reform the healthcare system by providing necessary insurance reforms, expanding coverage to those without insurance, reducing costs for families and businesses, and starting to reduce the country's deficit. It meets the President's criteria for healthcare reform by ensuring that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare without adding to the deficit. The bill includes crucial insurance sector reforms to prevent coverage denials or cancellations when needed. It covers almost all Americans and protects those with insurance from high out-of-pocket expenses. The bill also includes a public health insurance option to increase competition in the market. It also includes important healthcare system reforms and extends the solvency of the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund. The bill is fully paid for and will help reduce the long-term deficit. The Administration appreciates the hard work of the House of Representatives in crafting this legislation and looks forward to continuing to work with Congress on this historic bill.
