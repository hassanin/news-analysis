First Lady Melania Trump visited Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia to deliver welcoming remarks at the National Convening on Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) hosted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The convening aimed to launch a new HHS initiative to measure the long-term health outcomes and needs of infants suffering from NAS. Mrs. Trump met with mothers and babies born with NAS and visited the hospital's neonatal intensive care nursery. She expressed gratitude to the hospital staff for their efforts in helping families affected by NAS and praised the MATER program for its support to mothers and their babies. Mrs. Trump also mentioned being inspired by Dr. Loretta Finnegan's dedication to helping children and expressed interest in learning more about HHS's plans to develop and implement a new tracking system.
