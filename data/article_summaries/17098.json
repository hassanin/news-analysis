The United States strongly condemns the unconstitutional seizure of power in Burkina Faso by elements of the Presidential Security Regiment. They call for the immediate release of those being detained, for aligned forces to stand down, and for the rights of civilians to peacefully assemble. The US also urges Burkina Faso to return to the path of presidential elections in October. The US is disappointed that the actions of a few are threatening the opportunity for the people of Burkina Faso to build a new future through legitimate processes. The US will work with partners to bring about a peaceful resolution and will review foreign assistance to Burkina Faso based on evolving events.
