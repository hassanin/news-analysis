Yesterday, the White House Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein and staff from the Office of the Vice President and the White House Office of Public Engagement met with national religious denominational leaders to discuss reproductive rights. The meeting focused on protecting access to healthcare, including reproductive health, for underserved communities. Faith leaders emphasized the importance of constitutional rights, such as those affirmed in Roe v. Wade, and the need for women to make healthcare decisions without political interference. Concerns were raised about the challenges families face due to restrictive laws on reproductive healthcare. Senior Administration officials reaffirmed the President's commitment to reproductive rights and pledged to continue working with these religious groups.
