This article is a proclamation issued by President Barack Obama to implement the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement and make other related changes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). The proclamation includes a series of modifications to the HTS, such as removing Colombia from the list of designated beneficiary developing countries eligible for the benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), as well as establishing rules for determining the origin of goods for preferential tariff treatment. The proclamation also authorizes the establishment of an office within the Department of Commerce to provide administrative assistance and grants the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) the authority to make determinations regarding the availability of certain fabrics, yarns, or fibers in Colombia and the United States, as well as to take enforcement actions relating to trade with Colombia in textile and apparel goods. Additionally, the proclamation modifies the HTS to reflect changes made to other trade agreements, such as the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement. The modifications to the HTS outlined in the proclamation have specific effective dates for goods entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption. This proclamation supersedes any previous proclamations or executive orders that are inconsistent with its actions.
