The United States is proud to lead on Women, Peace, and Security globally. They were the first country to pass comprehensive legislation, the 2017 Women, Peace, and Security Act, which enshrines this achievement. October marks the 20th anniversary of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, which institutionalized the Women, Peace, and Security agenda. The US is calling on the UN and other Member States to enhance women's role in conflict prevention, resolution, and recovery. They are working to hold accountable those responsible for human rights violations against women and urge the international community to fully implement the Women, Peace, and Security agenda.
