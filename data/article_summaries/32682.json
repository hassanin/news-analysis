The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its monthly Employment Situation Report, which showed that nonfarm payroll employment rose by 223,000 jobs in May, exceeding expectations. This continues the trend of consecutive positive monthly job numbers, with employment growth averaging 207,000 jobs per month in 2018. Since President Donald J. Trump took office, the economy has added nearly 3 million jobs. The unemployment rate decreased to 3.8 percent, the lowest in over 18 years. African Americans and Asians also saw decreases in their unemployment rates. Job growth has been strong across various industries, particularly in manufacturing, construction, and mining. Manufacturing gains have significantly increased since President Trump took office, reflecting increased confidence among manufacturers and changes in investment decisions. The strong job market is also reflected in increased business investment. Overall, the surveys released by the BLS show that the U.S. labor market continues to thrive under the Trump Administration's pro-growth policies.
