President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Louisiana and has ordered Federal aid to help with recovery efforts from Tropical Storm Lee, which occurred from September 1-5, 2011. The funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. William J. Doran III has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-3272 or FEMA-NEWS-DESK@DHS.GOV.
