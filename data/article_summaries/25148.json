Seventy-five years ago, American forces landed on Guam to liberate the territory that Japan had seized after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Second Battle of Guam was crucial to the success of Operation Forager in World War II. After the battle, the US Navy constructed airfields that played a significant role in the success of aerial attacks in the Pacific. Today, Guam remains an important strategic hub in the Western Pacific and an economic and cultural asset of the United States.
