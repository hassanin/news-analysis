The article is a message from President Barack Obama to Congress regarding the "Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009," or "PAYGO." The president highlights the deficits inherited by his administration and attributes them to a lack of fiscal discipline and failure to pay for new policies, such as tax cuts that primarily benefited the wealthy. The president emphasizes the importance of fiscal responsibility and the need to pay for new tax or entitlement legislation by offsetting revenue increases or spending reductions. He suggests that enacting PAYGO into law would strengthen enforcement and demonstrate a commitment to reducing deficits and national debt. The president also mentions his proposed budget, which aims to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term and includes investments in health, education, and clean energy. He concludes by urging Congress to consider and approve the PAYGO proposal promptly.
