The article discusses how the United States has been losing its competitive edge in critical sectors such as infrastructure, clean energy, semiconductors, and biotechnology due to exporting jobs and importing products. However, President Biden's Investing in America Agenda, which includes legislation like the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act, is changing this trend. Since taking office in 2021, companies have committed over $435 billion in private sector investments across the country.
