The White House is hosting the United We Stand Summit to address the impact of hate-fueled violence on democracy and public safety. The summit aims to recognize communities that have experienced hateful attacks and promote a shared vision for a more united America. President Biden will rally a whole-of-society response to prevent, respond to, and recover from hate-fueled violence. The White House has announced a package of new actions that the federal government, civic, faith, philanthropic, and business leaders will take to address this issue and advance national unity. The summit will honor individuals who are working to stand against hate and promote unity in their communities. Survivors of hate-motivated violence will also share their stories. The participants include bipartisan and nonpartisan officials, civil rights groups, faith and community leaders, business leaders, law enforcement officials, former members of violent hate groups, and gun violence prevention leaders.
