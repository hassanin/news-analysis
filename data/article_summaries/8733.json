The Supreme Court has granted the Department of Justice's emergency stay application in the case of Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA. This decision prevents a lower court ruling from taking effect, which would have challenged the FDA's medical judgment and potentially endangered women's health. As a result, the drug mifepristone remains available and approved for safe use while the legal battle continues. The President supports the FDA's evidence-based approval of mifepristone and will defend the agency's authority to review and regulate prescription drugs. It is emphasized that the stakes are high for women in America, and the President urges the American people to use their vote to elect a Congress that will protect women's health rights, including the preservation of Roe v. Wade.
