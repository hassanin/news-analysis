President Biden and leaders from countries across the Indo-Pacific region have launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity. The participating countries include Australia, Brunei, India, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The goal of this framework is to create an Indo-Pacific region that is free and open, connected and prosperous, secure and resilient, and sustainable and inclusive. The leaders aim to establish new rules for trade in digital goods and services, eliminate bottlenecks in critical supply chains, commit to clean energy and decarbonization, and address corruption and tax evasion. The framework emphasizes high standards and inclusivity, and other nations will be welcome to join if they meet the goals and work towards achieving them. President Biden emphasized the United States' commitment to the Indo-Pacific region and its willingness to work together with friends and partners to deliver concrete benefits for all people. The launch of the framework marks the beginning of a collaborative effort to shape the future of the region's economy.
