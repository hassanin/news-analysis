The United States and other members of the United Nations Security Council have unanimously adopted UN Security Council Resolution 1977. This resolution extends the mandate of the Committee established pursuant to UNSCR 1540 for another ten years. The 1540 Committee's work includes adopting effective laws, security measures, border controls, and financial controls to prevent nuclear proliferation. Under resolution 1977, the 1540 Committee will also receive assistance from a group of experts and collaborate more closely with relevant regional and inter-governmental organizations. The continuation and enhancement of the 1540 Committee's work aligns with the United States' nonproliferation objectives outlined in President Obama's 2009 Prague speech and the 2010 Washington Nuclear Security Summit communiqu√© and work plan. To demonstrate its commitment to these goals, the United States has announced a voluntary contribution of $3 million to the UN to support 1540 Committee activities. Resolution 1977 ensures that these vital activities will continue uninterrupted during the Committee's new, extended mandate.
