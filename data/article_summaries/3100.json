President Biden will hold a secure video call with President Putin, and he will also speak with key European allies before the call to coordinate their message and ensure strong transatlantic unity. The agenda of the call will include concerns about Russia's military buildup and plans regarding Ukraine, as well as strategic stability, cyber issues, and Iran's nuclear program. The US emphasizes the importance of direct dialogue between leaders and the need for both deterrence and diplomacy in dealing with Russia. The US is deeply concerned about Russia's planning for military action against Ukraine, but it is also encouraging Russia to return to dialogue and fulfill the Minsk Agreement. The US has had discussions with European partners about imposing economic countermeasures on Russia in the event of a military escalation in Ukraine. The US has seen troop movements and increased disinformation activity from Russia, but it is not clear whether President Putin has made a decision on further military escalation. The US is prepared to support Ukraine and increase support for NATO allies in response to any aggression from Russia. President Biden will not publicly discuss the circumstances under which the US military could be used, but the focus will be on support for Ukraine, economic countermeasures, and NATO defense. The US has shared intelligence with European allies to build support and has a plan in place to provide reassurance to NATO allies in the event of a Russian invasion.
