The Department of Labor (DOL) is finalizing a rule and related exemptions to ensure that retirement savers receive investment advice in their best interest. Currently, financial advisers are not always required to act in their clients' best interest when giving retirement investment advice, which can lead to higher fees and lower returns for clients. These conflicts of interest cost American families an estimated $17 billion a year. The new rule will save affected middle-class families tens of thousands of dollars over their lifetime of savings and level the playing field for retirement advisers. The rule defines fiduciary investment advice and expands the types of retirement advice covered by fiduciary protections. It also includes exemptions that allow advisers and their firms to receive compensation if they prioritize their clients' best interest. The rule and exemptions have been revised based on extensive feedback to minimize compliance burdens and ensure continued access to advice. The rule is part of President Obama's efforts to strengthen consumer protections and fight against Wall Street's efforts to hinder progress.
