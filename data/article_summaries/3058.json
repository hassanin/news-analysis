President Biden has signed an Executive Order to promote competition in the American economy. The Order aims to address corporate consolidation, increase competition, and deliver benefits to consumers, workers, farmers, and small businesses. The lack of competition in various industries has led to higher prices for consumers, lower wages for workers, and limited opportunities for small businesses. The Order includes initiatives to tackle competition problems in various sectors, such as labor markets, healthcare, transportation, agriculture, internet service, and technology. It also encourages the leading antitrust agencies to focus enforcement efforts on key markets and coordinates other agencies' response to corporate consolidation. The Order aims to reduce barriers to competition, lower prices, increase wages, and promote innovation and economic growth.
