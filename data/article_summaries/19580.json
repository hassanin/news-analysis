President Obama has announced the expansion of the "Educate to Innovate" campaign, which aims to improve STEM education in the United States. The campaign, called Change the Equation, is a CEO-led effort to enhance science, technology, engineering, and math education. Within a year, Change the Equation plans to replicate successful privately-funded programs in 100 high-need schools and communities. The organization will also create a state-by-state "scorecard" to highlight areas for improvement and help companies increase their impact in STEM education. Change the Equation was founded by astronaut Sally Ride, former Intel Chairman Craig Barrett, Xerox CEO Ursula Burns, Time Warner Cable CEO Glenn Britt, and Eastman Kodak CEO Antonio Perez, with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Carnegie Corporation of New York. The campaign has resulted in over $700 million in financial and in-kind support for STEM programs. In addition, the President's Council of Advisors in Science and Technology (PCAST) will release a report with new policy proposals for improving STEM education. The article also highlights various public-private partnerships and commitments to enhance STEM education, such as increased opportunities for student engagement in science museums, improved teacher professional development, and the launch of the National STEM Video Game Challenge.
