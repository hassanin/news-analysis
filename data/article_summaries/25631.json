The Trump Administration strongly supports the inclusion of $5 billion for border wall construction and associated technology in the Homeland Security appropriations bill. The funding will be used to construct over 200 miles of new physical barrier along the Southern border, as well as surveillance technology and access roads. The Administration believes these investments are necessary to deter and prevent illegal border crossings by immigrants, human traffickers, criminals, child smugglers, and drug dealers. The Administration recognizes that difficult decisions had to be made to provide this funding, as well as the need for tradeoffs due to congressional rules. The Administration also appreciates the House Committee on Appropriations' commitment to increasing the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention beds and hiring more ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers. The Administration urges Congress to cut non-defense discretionary spending to fully fund border security and immigration enforcement without further jeopardizing the nation's fiscal well-being. President Trump has emphasized that border security is national security, and the Administration condemns attacks on ICE and CBP officers. Funding for the wall, additional officers, and detention beds is seen as critical to protecting the nation against illegal immigration, crime, and terrorism.
