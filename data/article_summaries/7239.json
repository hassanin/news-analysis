President Joe Biden delivered a speech in La Crosse, Wisconsin, celebrating a bipartisan infrastructure deal and outlining its benefits for American families. He emphasized the importance of investing in infrastructure to create jobs, modernize the country, and improve the lives of working-class Americans. The deal includes funding for road and bridge repairs, replacing lead water pipes, expanding high-speed internet access, building electric vehicle charging stations, improving public transit, modernizing airports and ports, and investing in clean energy transmission. Biden highlighted the positive impact these investments will have on job creation, economic growth, safety, and the environment. He also mentioned his plans to continue pushing for additional investments in his American Families Plan, including extending the Child Tax Credit and addressing other important issues like clean energy, housing, caregiving, and education. Biden assured Americans that these investments would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans and cracking down on tax evasion. He concluded by expressing his belief in the power of American democracy to come together and deliver for the people.
