President Barack Obama has proclaimed the week of August 9 through August 15, 2015, as National Health Center Week. In his proclamation, he highlights the important role that health centers play in providing comprehensive, high-quality, and affordable primary healthcare to patients regardless of their ability to pay. These centers serve nearly 23 million patients and are a vital source of primary care in communities across America. They also provide patients with information on regular checkups and screenings to encourage timely care and reduce the need for emergency treatment. Additionally, health centers have played a significant role in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act by providing health insurance enrollment assistance to millions of individuals. The establishment of the Community Health Center Fund has supported the operation, expansion, and construction of health centers nationwide. Obama encourages Americans to celebrate National Health Center Week by visiting their local health centers and exploring the programs they offer to keep families healthy.
