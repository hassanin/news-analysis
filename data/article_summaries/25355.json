The article discusses the need for Congress to pass two bills, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate's Law, in order to make America safer. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act would withhold federal grant money from jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), while Kate's Law would increase penalties for deported aliens who reenter the United States. The article highlights the case of Kate Steinle, who was murdered by an illegal alien who had been deported multiple times but was released by San Francisco instead of being handed over to ICE. It argues that cities that protect criminal illegal aliens are putting their law-abiding residents at risk and that passing these two bills would be a major step for public safety.
