On April 30, 2010, the President signed two laws into effect. The first law, H.R. 5147, is called the "Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2010." This law extends the authorities to collect taxes that fund the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, make expenditures from the fund, and make grants to airports under the Airport Improvement Program. The extension is effective until July 3, 2010. The second law, S. 3253, extends the authorizations of certain Small Business Administration programs until July 31, 2010.
