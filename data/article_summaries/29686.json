President Trump announced that Foxconn, a global manufacturing company, will build a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Wisconsin, investing billions of dollars and creating thousands of jobs. The initial investment of over $10 billion will create at least 3,000 jobs, with the potential for up to 13,000 jobs in the near future. This facility represents the return of LCD electronics and electronics manufacturing to the United States. President Trump credited his administration's efforts to remove job-killing regulations, promote Buy American and Hire American policies, repeal and replace Obamacare, cut taxes, fix trade deals, and rebuild infrastructure for attracting this investment. Chairman Terry Gou of Foxconn expressed his faith in the American economy and the bond between his company and the administration. The announcement was met with applause and President Trump expressed his gratitude to Foxconn and the American workers.
