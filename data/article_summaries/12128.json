The White House has announced the launch of Federal Register 2.0, a new format for the official chronicle of White House and Executive agency activities. This new format allows readers to easily access and customize its daily contents. The transformation was undertaken by the Government Printing Office and the National Archives and Records Administration in collaboration with the White House open government initiative. The goal is to provide the public with unprecedented access to the federal decision-making process. The Federal Register 2.0 can be accessed at GPO.gov or data.gov and will vastly increase its usefulness to the American public. The change supplements the official publishing formats with "XML," a machine-readable form of text that can be manipulated in various ways with digital applications. This allows people to access and analyze its contents in novel ways. The Federal Register 2.0 is part of the Administration's commitment to Open Government and follows the launch of other transparency tools such as Open for Questions and the IT Dashboard. The Federal Register has grown in size and complexity over the years, making it difficult for the public to fully utilize its content. The change also opens the door for innovative entrepreneurs to develop new apps that will allow the public to interact with the Federal Register in new ways.
