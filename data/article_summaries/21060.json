President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222 will continue in effect for one year beyond August 17, 2016. This is in accordance with Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, which requires the President to publish a notice in the Federal Register and transmit it to Congress within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the emergency declaration. The national emergency was declared due to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979.
