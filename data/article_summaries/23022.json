President Barack Obama has transmitted the Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fisheries Resources in the North Pacific Ocean to the Senate for ratification. The Convention aims to establish a regional fisheries management organization to ensure the sustainable use of fisheries resources in the high seas of the North Pacific Ocean while protecting marine ecosystems. The Convention will require implementing legislation, which is currently being drafted and will be separately submitted to Congress. Ratification by the United States would help prevent destructive fishing practices and ensure that future U.S. fisheries interests in the region are considered. President Obama recommends that the Senate give favorable consideration to the Convention and ratify it as soon as possible.
