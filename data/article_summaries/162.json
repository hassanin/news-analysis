President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law aims to provide support to America's small businesses by improving the country's aging infrastructure. Small businesses play a crucial role in the US economy, contributing over 40 percent of GDP, creating two-thirds of net new jobs, and employing nearly half of the country's workers. The infrastructure improvements proposed in the law will help these businesses to innovate, create well-paying jobs, and continue providing essential goods and services to communities.
