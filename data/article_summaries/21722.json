In this statement, the President discusses the need for financial reform in response to the 2008 financial crisis. He highlights the negative impacts of the crisis, including job losses, wealth destruction, and lack of credit for small businesses. The President calls for accountability in the financial system and emphasizes the importance of protecting taxpayers from having to bail out large banks and financial institutions. He outlines several key proposals, including the creation of a consumer financial protection agency, stronger supervision for large financial firms, transparency in derivatives and other financial markets, and separation of banking from proprietary trading and hedge funds. The President also emphasizes the need for the government to have tools to respond to future crises and prevent any firm from being considered "Too Big to Fail." He expresses his commitment to working with lawmakers to strengthen the bill and opposes any attempts to weaken it. The President emphasizes the importance of a strong, independent consumer protection agency that sets and enforces rules across the financial marketplace. He rejects any attempts to undermine its independence or exclude certain financial entities from its oversight. The President also stresses the importance of regulating all derivatives and giving shareholders a say in compensation that rewards risk-taking. He asserts that in future crises, financial companies should bear the responsibility, not taxpayers.
