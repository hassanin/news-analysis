The President has taken actions to address the threat posed by the Syrian government's support for terrorism, occupation of Lebanon, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, and obstruction of stabilization efforts in Iraq. The regime's brutality and repression of the Syrian people not only endangers them but also creates instability in the region. As a result, the national emergency declared in 2004 and subsequent measures must continue beyond May 11, 2020. The United States condemns the violence and human rights abuses by the Assad regime, as well as its Russian and Iranian supporters. The United States calls for a ceasefire, delivery of humanitarian aid, and a political transition in Syria. The future of the national emergency will depend on changes in the Syrian government's composition, policies, and actions.
