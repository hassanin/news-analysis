President Donald J. Trump will award the Medal of Honor to Sergeant Major John L. Canley, United States Marine Corps (Retired), for his actions during the Battle of Hue City in Vietnam in 1968. Canley, then a Gunnery Sergeant, fought off enemy attacks and carried wounded Marines to safety despite his own injuries. When his commanding officer was wounded, he took command and led his company into Hue City. Canley's heroic actions saved the lives of his teammates. Canley retired from the Marine Corps in 1981 and currently resides in California. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who distinguish themselves by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of their own lives.
