In this article, President Barack Obama issues a memorandum regarding the continuation of U.S. drug interdiction assistance to the government of Colombia. The memorandum states that the interdiction of aircraft involved in illicit drug trafficking in Colombian airspace is necessary due to the significant threat it poses to the country's national security. It also highlights the importance of implementing procedures to protect against innocent loss of life during these interdictions, including the use of effective means to identify and warn aircraft before the use of force is directed against them. The Secretary of State is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register and notify Congress.
