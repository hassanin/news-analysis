The President's FY 2024 Budget focuses on investing in America, reducing costs for families, protecting Social Security and Medicare, and reducing the deficit. It includes major reforms to the individual and corporate tax codes to ensure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share. The Budget also cuts wasteful spending on Big Pharma, Big Oil, and other special interests, and aims to crack down on systemic fraud and identity theft. Congressional Republicans have rejected this approach and continue to propose cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs. However, President Biden remains committed to rejecting cuts that would harm people's healthcare or increase costs. The Budget also includes proposals to cut wasteful spending on special interests, crack down on fraud, eliminate corporate subsidies, and make programs more cost-effective. It aims to save taxpayer dollars and improve program efficiency.
