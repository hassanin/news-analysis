The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to engage communities with large numbers of uninsured individuals and help them gain coverage. The challenge aims to reach the remaining 10.5 million eligible uninsured people in the country. The Department of Health and Human Services, along with State-based Marketplaces, will track new signups in participating communities and compare them to estimates of the number of eligible uninsured people. The community that makes the most progress will receive recognition and a visit from President Obama. Las Vegas is one of the 20 communities participating in the challenge. In Nevada, health insurance coverage is affordable, with a majority of people being able to find plans for $100 or less. Tax credits have also helped consumers save on average $270 per month. However, there are still 96,000 uninsured individuals eligible for the Marketplace in Las Vegas.
