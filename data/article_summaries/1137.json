In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. emphasizes the importance of finding cures for cancer and addressing the needs of patients and their families. He discusses the goal of ending cancer as we know it and highlights the impact of breast cancer, with nearly 300,000 women expected to be diagnosed this year in the US. Despite advancements in cancer research and treatment, a breast cancer diagnosis remains daunting, leading to a confusing world of medical appointments, procedures, and expenses. 

To combat this, President Biden reignited the Cancer Moonshot initiative, aiming to cut the overall cancer death rate in half within the next 25 years and transform more cancers into treatable diseases. He established the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) and secured $2.5 billion in funding to drive scientific breakthroughs in cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. ARPA-H is exploring the use of mRNA technology, such as that used in COVID-19 vaccines, to train the immune system to fight cancer. The agency will also focus on improving surgical procedures for cancerous tumor removal and supporting a diverse workforce in cancer research.

President Biden acknowledges that affordability is crucial in cancer treatment and has made it a priority to cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare, including expensive cancer drugs. His administration has also strengthened Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to expand and protect healthcare coverage. The ACA ensures coverage for cancer screenings, including mammograms, and supports cancer survivors and individuals with preexisting conditions. Additionally, investments have been made to expand access to breast cancer screenings for veterans exposed to burn pits.

The article provides resources for more information on breast cancer, such as the National Cancer Institute's website and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. President Biden proclaims October 2023 as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, encouraging individuals, organizations, and government agencies to participate in activities that raise awareness about breast cancer prevention and control while paying tribute to those who have lost their lives to the disease.
