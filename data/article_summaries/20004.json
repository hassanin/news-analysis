The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a press briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest on June 1, 2015. Earnest expressed appreciation for the support and condolences received by the Biden family after the passing of Beau Biden. He then discussed the expiration of the Patriot Act provisions and the impact on national security. He explained that without the renewal of these provisions, national security professionals do not have the necessary tools to keep the country safe. He emphasized that the USA Freedom Act, which includes reforms to protect privacy and civil liberties while renewing important tools for national security professionals, should be passed by the Senate. Earnest also addressed concerns about the President's involvement in the Iran nuclear talks and the potential impact of Secretary Kerry's injury on the negotiations. He reiterated the importance of passing the USA Freedom Act and expressed disappointment in the political gamesmanship surrounding the issue. Earnest also discussed the release of an American being held by Houthis in Yemen and the administration's efforts to secure the release of Americans held abroad. Finally, he touched on the situation in Greece and the administration's ongoing efforts to reach an agreement.
