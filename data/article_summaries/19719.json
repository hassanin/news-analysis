President Obama will be pardoning the National Thanksgiving Turkey in a ceremony at the White House. The two turkeys, named Cheese and Mac, were chosen from submissions by Ohio students and Morven Park visitors. The American public voted on Twitter for which turkey would become the 2014 National Thanksgiving Turkey. After the pardoning, the turkeys will be sent to their permanent home at Morven Park's "Turkey Hill" in Virginia. The First Family also received two dressed turkeys from Jaindl's Turkey Farm in Pennsylvania, which will be donated to a local food bank.
