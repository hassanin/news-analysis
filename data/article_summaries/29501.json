On Religious Freedom Day, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation celebrating the United States' commitment to freedom of conscience and the freedom to practice one's own faith. The proclamation recognizes the Pilgrims and other early settlers who came to America to escape religious persecution. It also highlights the importance of religious freedom in the pursuit of truth and the protection of human dignity. However, the proclamation acknowledges that religious freedom is currently under attack, with efforts to limit it or separate it from other civil liberties. The Trump administration is taking action to protect religious liberty and seek justice against those who interfere with it. The Department of Justice is prosecuting those who use violence or threats to impede religious freedom, and the Department of Health and Human Services has made policy changes to protect religious freedom in healthcare programs. The proclamation also mentions the global persecution of people for their faith and the efforts of the US government to address this issue. Finally, President Trump proclaims January 16, 2019, as Religious Freedom Day and calls on all Americans to commemorate the day and uphold religious liberty both at home and abroad.
