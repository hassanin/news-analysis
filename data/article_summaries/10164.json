Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley, Jr. has expressed support for President Obama's compromise agreement with Congressional leaders to extend middle-class tax relief and unemployment benefits. Mayor Riley believes this deal is necessary to help those in need in the community and stimulate the economy. Without this agreement, income taxes on the middle class would increase, unemployment insurance for millions of Americans would expire, and other important tax relief measures for working people would not be available. Mayor Riley commends President Obama for his decision to build a bipartisan compromise and believes it shows leadership and political courage. He believes the American people elected Obama to rise above politics and take action to move the country forward, and that is what he has done.
