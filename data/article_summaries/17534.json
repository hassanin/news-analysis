The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a press call to discuss the changes to policies and regulations affecting Cuban nationals. The main change is the repeal of the "wet foot, dry foot" policy, which allowed Cubans who reached U.S. soil to stay and apply for residency after one year. Going forward, Cuban migrants who arrive in the U.S. illegally will be subject to deportation, consistent with immigration laws and enforcement priorities. The Cuban government has agreed to accept back Cuban migrants who have been out of Cuba for less than four years. The ultimate goal is for the Cubans to accept all migrants ordered deported by the U.S. The Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program has also been repealed, while the Cuban Family Reunification Program will continue. The Coast Guard will continue to interdict Cuban migrants at sea. The changes are part of the normalization of relations with Cuba and the effort to equalize immigration policies with other countries. The repeal of the Cuban Adjustment Act is recommended by the administration. The policy change is effective immediately, and Cuban migrants will be treated like migrants from other countries. They can still apply for asylum, but they will not be paroled in during the adjudication process, meaning they will not receive the benefits under the Cuban Adjustment Act.
