The article discusses the anticipated calculation of the GDP for the third quarter of 2010. Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Council of Economic Advisers, states that the real GDP increased by 2.0% annually in the third quarter, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth. However, the economy still needs faster growth to reduce the unemployment rate more quickly. Some key components of the GDP, such as consumer spending and fixed investments, continued to expand. Consumer spending increased by 2.6% annually, while fixed investments increased by 0.8% annually. Business investments in equipment and software also grew by 12%. However, residential investment decreased. Goolsbee emphasizes the need for additional measures recommended by the President to stimulate growth and job creation, such as tax cuts for the middle class, infrastructure investment, and promoting exports.
