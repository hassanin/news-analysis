The article includes several analyses from economists and economic research groups on the impact of the framework tax agreement on economic expansion and job growth. These analyses highlight that the tax agreement could boost growth by 1 to 1.2 percentage points in 2011, reduce uncertainty around taxes, boost investors' risk appetite, and provide substantial fiscal support for growth. It is expected to drive a better outcome for the US economy compared to not implementing the agreement. The tax cuts are also expected to lead to an increase in real consumer spending and provide relief to businesses. Overall, economists have a positive outlook on the deal and its potential impact on the economy.
