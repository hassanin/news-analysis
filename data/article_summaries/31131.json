On December 21, 2018, the President signed two laws. The first law, H.R. 7213, redesignates the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office of the Department of Homeland Security as the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office. The second law, S. 756, called the "First Step Act of 2018," aims to reduce recidivism by providing increased evidence-based recidivism reduction programming, reducing certain Federal mandatory minimum sentences, and reauthorizing several grant programs to improve reentry services.
