Vice President Kamala Harris and President Emmanuel Macron of France met at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C. as part of a State Visit to highlight the strong partnership between the U.S. and France in outer space. This meeting builds on their previous meeting in November 2021 where they agreed to strengthen space cooperation. Since then, France has signed the Artemis Accords for civil use of space, and the United States has joined the Space for Climate Observatory (SCO) to develop climate monitoring tools. The two countries also held the first Comprehensive Dialogue on Space to discuss cooperation on civil, commercial, and national security space initiatives. Both the Vice President and President Macron announced commitments not to conduct destructive anti-satellite missile testing. During the meeting, they discussed strengthening space cooperation across various sectors, received a briefing on climate science, and explored ways to better utilize space data for addressing the climate crisis. They also discussed the United States' expanded participation in the SCO and the upcoming launch of the U.S.-France Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission. Additionally, they discussed space exploration with U.S. and French astronauts, emphasizing the importance of a crewed presence in low Earth orbit, International Space Station operations, and joint investments in the exploration of the Moon and Mars.
