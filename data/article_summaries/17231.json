This article is about an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in 2012 called "Accelerating Investment in Industrial Energy Efficiency." The order aims to promote American manufacturing by facilitating investments in energy efficiency at industrial facilities. The industrial sector is responsible for over 30% of energy consumed in the United States, and energy costs affect the competitiveness of manufacturers. The order encourages investments in reducing energy use through more efficient manufacturing processes and the use of combined heat and power (CHP) systems. The goal is to improve the competitiveness of US manufacturing, lower energy costs, reduce air pollution, and create jobs. The order directs various executive departments and agencies to coordinate efforts to identify, develop, and encourage the adoption of investment models and state policies for industrial energy efficiency and CHP. The Departments of Energy, Commerce, and Agriculture, along with the Environmental Protection Agency, are specifically tasked with coordinating policies to encourage investment in industrial efficiency. They will engage with states, industrial companies, utility companies, and other stakeholders to accelerate investment. The order also outlines specific actions and initiatives that these agencies should undertake, such as providing assistance and incentives, improving data collection and analysis, and supporting state-specific policies. The order concludes with general provisions, stating that it should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
