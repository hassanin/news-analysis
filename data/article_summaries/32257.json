On June 22, 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Servicemenâ€™s Readjustment Act of 1944, also known as the G.I. Bill, to provide care and benefits to World War II veterans. The Department of Labor estimated that many of the 16 million veterans would be unemployed after the war and would need assistance with healthcare, housing, and education. The G.I. Bill allocated billions of dollars in federal funding to help veterans pursue degrees, purchase homes, and access quality insurance. The G.I. Bill is considered one of the most significant and successful bipartisan legislative achievements, benefiting millions of veterans and their families. In 2017, the "Forever G.I. Bill" was signed into law, removing the 15-year limit on veterans' access to education benefits. On the 75th anniversary of the G.I. Bill, President Trump and Melania express gratitude to service members, veterans, and their families for their sacrifice.
