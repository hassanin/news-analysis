President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring May 2017 as National Mental Health Awareness Month. The proclamation acknowledges the millions of American families affected by mental illness and emphasizes the need to ensure that those who are suffering receive the care and treatment they need. It highlights the fact that a significant number of Americans with mental illness do not receive the necessary treatment and often end up in emergency rooms, prisons, or on the streets. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of empowering states, law enforcement, first responders, doctors, and families to help those with severe mental illnesses and to fight the stigma associated with mental illness. It recognizes the relationship between mental illness and other societal challenges such as homelessness, substance abuse, and suicide, and highlights the need for innovative medical strategies to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The proclamation also mentions the importance of addressing substance abuse and addiction in order to improve mental health outcomes. It announces that on May 4, 2017, National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day will be commemorated, with special recognition awards being given to individuals who have spoken openly about their behavioral health challenges. The proclamation concludes by calling upon all Americans to support citizens suffering from mental illness, raise awareness through appropriate programs and activities, and commit to innovative prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
