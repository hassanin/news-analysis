The Trump Administration commends the House and Senate for reaching a conference agreement on a "minibus" appropriations package that supports the military, veterans, and infrastructure. The package includes funding for President Trump's reforms at the Department of Veterans Affairs and efforts to modernize the nuclear deterrent. Despite attempts by congressional Democrats to increase spending, the President emphasizes the need to restore fiscal responsibility and protect taxpayers. President Trump plans to sign the legislation and collaborate with Congress on funding for the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies while exercising fiscal restraint.
