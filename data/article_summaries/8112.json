On National Child's Day, President Joe Biden emphasizes the importance of ensuring that every child in America has a fair opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background. To support this, he is working with Congress to pass the Build Back Better plan, which includes provisions for affordable child care, universal preschool, lower education costs, tax cuts for working families, expanded health care coverage, and investments in climate change mitigation. These efforts aim to create a safer and healthier upbringing for children, ease the financial burden on families, improve educational attainment, reduce pollution, and provide clean water and internet access. The President also highlights the American Rescue Plan's impact in reducing child poverty and providing resources for education and mental health. He calls for continued support and investment in children, as their future is crucial for the nation's success. The proclamation designates November 20, 2021, as National Child's Day and encourages appropriate observance of the day.
