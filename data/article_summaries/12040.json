The article is about Executive Order 13556, issued by President Barack Obama on November 4, 2010. The purpose of this order is to establish a program for managing information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls. The order aims to create an open and uniform system for handling unclassified information throughout the executive branch of the United States government. Currently, different agencies have their own policies and markings for safeguarding and controlling information, leading to inconsistencies and difficulties in sharing information. This order seeks to address these issues by establishing a program for managing Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) that emphasizes openness and uniformity. The National Archives and Records Administration will serve as the Executive Agent to implement the order and ensure compliance. The order also mandates a review of current designations and the development of CUI categories and policies. Agencies will be required to provide a plan for compliance, and deadlines for implementation will be established. The order is to be implemented in accordance with applicable laws, standards, and guidelines, and the Director of National Intelligence may issue policy directives and guidelines for intelligence-related information. The order does not create any rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States. The Presidential Memorandum of May 7, 2008, on the same subject, is rescinded.
