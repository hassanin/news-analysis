President Biden and Chancellor Merkel have launched the U.S.-Germany Climate and Energy Partnership, aiming to strengthen climate ambition and collaboration on policies and sustainable technologies to achieve a global net-zero future. Both countries are committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement and taking action to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The partnership will focus on three key areas: climate action, transformational energy technologies, and energy transitions in emerging economies. The United States and Germany will work together to raise global climate ambition, develop actionable roadmaps for emissions reduction, and mobilize finance for sustainable development. They will also collaborate on renewable energy technologies, energy storage, sustainable hydrogen, electric vehicles, and resilient energy systems. Additionally, the partnership aims to accelerate sustainable energy in emerging economies, including Central and Eastern Europe and major emitters in South and Southeast Asia.
