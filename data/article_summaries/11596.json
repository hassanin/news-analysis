The White House has released the design for the 2009 Souvenir Easter Egg, which is available for purchase prior to the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. This year's egg is focused on promoting a healthy and active lifestyle for children. It is also the most environmentally friendly egg in the history of the event, using less paperboard and featuring renewable, vegetable oil-based inks. Interested families can view and purchase the egg online through the National Parks Foundation or at designated locations in Washington, DC.
