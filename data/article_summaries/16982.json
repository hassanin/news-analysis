President Barack Obama is set to deliver a major national security speech at the National Archives on Thursday. The speech will focus on Obama's vision for strengthening the country's security and will outline the steps his administration has taken and plans to take in support of those goals and principles. The event is open to correspondents but requires an RSVP due to space limitations. Media coverage will be pooled for TV cameras and still photographers, with an auxiliary area for correspondents.
