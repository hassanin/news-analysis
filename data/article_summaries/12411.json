President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of New York and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts after a severe winter storm, snowstorm, and flooding occurred from November 17-26, 2014. The declaration allows for federal funding to assist with emergency work, facility repairs, and snow assistance in certain counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. William L. Vogel has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
