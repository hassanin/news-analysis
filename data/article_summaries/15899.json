President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 22, 2016, as National Maritime Day in the United States. The proclamation honors the United States Merchant Marine, recognizing their important role in protecting and advancing the country's interests. The Merchant Mariners have historically served as the "fourth arm of defense" and have played a crucial role in transporting American goods, especially during times of war. The proclamation acknowledges their bravery in facing various threats, such as combatants, pirates, disease outbreaks, and natural disasters. It also highlights the economic impact of the Merchant Marine, generating trillions of dollars of economic activity each year. The proclamation calls upon the American people to show their gratitude to these men and women and to display the flag of the United States at their homes and communities. It also requests that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on National Maritime Day.
