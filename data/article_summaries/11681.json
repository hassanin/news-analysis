President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Louisiana and has ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals and offers assistance such as grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will oversee federal recovery operations in the affected area, and damage surveys are ongoing to determine if more assistance is needed in additional areas. Residents and business owners who suffered losses can apply for assistance online or by phone.
