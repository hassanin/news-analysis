Leaders from over 100 countries, including the United States, called for an ambitious amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), potent greenhouse gases used in air conditioning, refrigeration, and foam insulation. The countries are aiming for an "early freeze date," which means stopping the production and consumption of HFCs and beginning the process of phasing them out. In addition, more than 500 companies and organizations, along with hundreds of sub-national governments, have called for strong action on HFCs. Donor countries and philanthropists also announced their intent to provide $80 million in support to help countries implement an ambitious amendment and improve energy efficiency. The funding will assist Article 5 countries in developing programs to track and reduce HFCs and transition to alternatives with reduced climate-changing properties. The United States Department of Energy also published the results of a testing program that demonstrated viable replacements for HFCs in rooftop air conditioning units. The results showed that these replacements performed just as well at high temperatures as current refrigerants.
