President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018," but he has expressed concerns about certain provisions in the law that he believes infringe upon his constitutional authorities as Commander in Chief and as the sole representative of the United States in foreign affairs. Specifically, he objects to provisions that dictate US policy in external military and foreign affairs, require diplomatic initiatives with international partners, restrict the President's control over personnel and materiel for military operations, and mandate submission of information protected by executive privilege. President Trump has stated that his administration will interpret these provisions in a manner consistent with his constitutional authority.
