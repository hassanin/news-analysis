President Obama has signed an executive order renewing the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This demonstrates the President's appreciation for the important role these institutions have played in educating citizens and the Administration's commitment to assisting HBCUs in accomplishing their mission. The executive order establishes the White House Initiative on HBCUs, which will be housed in the Department of Education and led by Dr. John Wilson. The initiative aims to strengthen the capacity of HBCUs to participate in federal programs, foster private-sector initiatives and partnerships, improve the availability and quality of information about HBCUs, share best practices within the HBCU community, and explore new ways to improve the relationship between the federal government and HBCUs. Additionally, President Obama's FY 11 Budget includes $98 million in new funding for HBCUs at the Department of Education, as well as funding for the HBCU Capital Financing program and the Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institution program. The budget also includes an increase in the Pell Grant maximum award and provisions to support HBCUs and Minority Serving Institutions through the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act (SAFRA). Overall, President Obama is committed to strengthening educational opportunities at HBCUs and providing students with a complete and competitive education.
