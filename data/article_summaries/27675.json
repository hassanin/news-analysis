The White House is closely monitoring the dispute over the governorship of Afghanistan's Balkh Province and is calling for a quick and peaceful resolution. They believe that the continued impasse benefits terrorists and Afghanistan's enemies. The United States wants the dispute to be resolved in a way that strengthens security and the government's ability to fulfill its obligations to its citizens. Violence should not be used to resolve the matter, and no party should delay a resolution for their own interests. The issue should be decided by Afghans within the framework of their constitution and in accordance with the rule of law and equality.
