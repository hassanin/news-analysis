On July 24, 2011, President Biden declared a national emergency due to the threat posed by significant transnational criminal organizations. This was done through Executive Order 13581, using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. On March 15, 2019, further steps were taken through Executive Order 13863 to address the evolving nature and increasing sophistication of these organizations, which pose a direct threat to the United States and its citizens. These organizations engage in widespread illegal activities, including violence and abuse, and derive revenue from these criminal acts. The national emergency declared in 2011 and expanded in 2019 is set to continue beyond July 24, 2022, as these organizations still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. This continuation is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, and the notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
