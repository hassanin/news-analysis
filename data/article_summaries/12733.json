In this statement, the President commemorates the day in 1862 when President Lincoln freed the enslaved people of Washington, DC, before issuing the Emancipation Proclamation. The President mentions that an original copy of the Emancipation Proclamation now hangs in the Oval Office and expresses gratitude for the struggles and sacrifices of those who made emancipation possible. The President also highlights the lack of voting representation and full autonomy over local issues for DC residents and calls on Congress to pass legislation that provides them with voting representation and to improve the Home Rule Charter.
