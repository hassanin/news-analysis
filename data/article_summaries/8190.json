President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for emergency measures in California following severe winter storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that began on December 27, 2022. The federal share for debris removal and emergency protective measures has been increased to 100% of the total eligible costs for 60 days from the start of the incident period. This is in addition to the previous major disaster declaration that made federal funding available for public assistance, hazard mitigation, and other needs assistance at 75% of the total eligible costs.
