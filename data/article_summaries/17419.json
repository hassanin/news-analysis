President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Florida and has ordered federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane Hermine. The declaration makes federal funding available to individuals and local governments in several counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and other assistance programs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Terry L. Quarles as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are still ongoing, and additional counties may be designated for assistance. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone.
