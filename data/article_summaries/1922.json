The Biden-Harris Administration is launching the Women in the Sustainable Economy (WISE) Initiative, which aims to empower women economically by providing access to employment, training, leadership roles, and financial resources in industries critical to the future. Over $900 million in commitments have been announced by governments, private sector companies, foundations, and civil society to support women's economic participation in sectors such as clean energy, fisheries, recycling, forest management, and environmental conservation. This initiative aligns with the U.S. National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality and the U.S. Strategy on Global Women's Economic Security. It builds on previous efforts by Vice President Harris to invest in women's economic empowerment globally, including closing the digital gender divide. The initiative focuses on improving women's access to land, energy, and water, which in turn enhances food security, agricultural productivity, and addresses climate change. The WISE Initiative is a public-private partnership with three key pillars: Engendering Industries, Climate Gender Equity Fund, and Equal Stake in the Soil. These pillars aim to increase economic opportunities for women in male-dominated sectors, expand access to climate finance for women-led organizations, and advance women's land rights. More than $900 million in commitments have been made by government-aligned efforts, private sector companies, philanthropies, and civil society organizations. WISE partners can make direct commitments or align their efforts with the initiative's pillars, and all partners will be part of a broader community of practice.
