The United States has officially recognized the Cook Islands as a sovereign and independent state and will establish diplomatic relations between the two nations. This announcement builds upon a longstanding history of cooperation between the United States and the Cook Islands, dating back to World War II. The partnership aims to address various challenges including illegal fishing, climate change, economic growth, and a free and open Indo-Pacific region. The United States plans to collaborate closely with the Cook Islands, the Pacific Islands Forum, and the Pacific Community to strengthen Pacific regionalism. The objective is to align the United States' Pacific Partnership Strategy with the Pacific Islands Forum 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. The United States also looks forward to participating in the upcoming PIF Leaders' Summit to support Pacific voices and choices. This recognition and establishment of diplomatic relations will not only strengthen the ties between the two nations but also contribute to a more secure, prosperous, and free future for both peoples and people around the world.
