Nearly 1 in 4 Americans struggle to afford prescription drugs, and Medicare is currently prohibited from negotiating drug prices. President Biden and Congressional Democrats have proposed a plan to end this prohibition and reduce the costs of prescription drugs. The plan includes allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for high-cost drugs, both those obtained at the pharmacy counter and those administered in a doctor's office. The negotiation process will be fair for manufacturers and will target drugs that have been on the market for a certain number of years. Drug companies that refuse to negotiate will face an excise tax. Additionally, a tax penalty will be imposed if drug companies increase their prices faster than inflation. The plan also aims to lower out-of-pocket costs for seniors, capping the amount they have to pay for drugs under Medicare Part D at $2,000 per year. Insulin prices will be lowered to $35 per month for Americans with diabetes. Lawmakers are working to finalize the legislative text to save seniors money at the pharmacy counter without increasing premiums.
