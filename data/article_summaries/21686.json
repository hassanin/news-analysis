The Senate has confirmed Sally Jewell as the next Secretary of the Interior. President Obama is pleased with this bipartisan action, as Jewell has extensive business experience, including in the energy sector, and a lifelong commitment to conservation. She possesses strong management skills, an appreciation for protecting public lands, and a understanding of being good stewards of natural resources. Jewell's commitment to energy and climate issues, government-to-government relationship with Indian Country, and recognition of the link between conservation and job creation make her an exceptional choice for the position. President Obama is looking forward to Jewell's counsel on these important issues, as they work towards responsible use of natural resources and the preservation of national treasures.
