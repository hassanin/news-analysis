The Equal Futures Partnership is a U.S.-led initiative that aims to empower women economically and politically. Partner countries commit to taking actions such as legal and policy reforms to ensure women's participation in public life and inclusive economic growth. The partnership includes countries such as Australia, Belgium, Croatia, Japan, Mexico, and the USA. New member commitments include Japan's goal to increase the percentage of women in government leadership positions to at least 30% by 2020, Italy's programs to improve women's access to careers and address gender-based violence, and Mexico's focus on the economic empowerment of indigenous and rural women entrepreneurs. The United States has also made commitments, including organizing a White House Summit on Working Families and supporting initiatives for in-depth STEM education for girls, innovative business education for women entrepreneurs, and promoting media literacy. The partnership collaborates with multilateral stakeholders and the private sector to support implementation efforts. Various organizations and companies are involved in providing mentorship, training, and support for women's economic participation. Additional countries interested in joining the partnership are encouraged to reach out for more information.
