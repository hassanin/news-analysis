The White House has issued a proclamation declaring October 16-22, 2011 as National Character Counts Week. During this week, Americans are encouraged to celebrate the country's core values and pass them on to the next generation. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of setting a positive example for children and teaching them virtues such as personal integrity, ingenuity, and a drive to serve others. It also highlights the role of role models in shaping character and promoting patriotism and civic pride. The proclamation acknowledges the need for creating a climate of acceptance and compassion in schools and communities, particularly in light of tragic events related to bullying and harassment. It calls on all Americans to preserve and uphold the values that have kept the country strong, prosperous, and free. Public officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans are urged to observe National Character Counts Week through appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
