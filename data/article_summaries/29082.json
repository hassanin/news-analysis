President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will host their first Congressional Picnic on the South Lawn of the White House. The event will take place at 6:00 p.m. and will be attended by Vice President and Mrs. Pence, as well as Members of Congress and their families. The theme for the picnic is "Picnic in the Park," inspired by a summer evening in Central Park in New York. The First Lady expressed her excitement for the event and emphasized the importance of coming together as colleagues and friends, especially in light of the recent shooting at the Congressional baseball game practice. The Congressional Picnic is an annual bipartisan event that started under President Reagan, and this year's picnic will feature activities such as racing sailboats and a carousel. The United States Marine orchestra will perform and President Trump will give remarks. The menu for the picnic will consist of traditional picnic fare.
