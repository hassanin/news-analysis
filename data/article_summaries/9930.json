President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 15th to May 21st as World Trade Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of American businesses in the global economy and highlights the need for a strong trade agenda that promotes exports and domestic job growth. The proclamation also mentions the National Export Initiative, an effort launched by the Obama administration to support American businesses in selling their goods and services internationally. The goal is to double exports by 2015 and create more job opportunities for American workers. The proclamation encourages Americans to participate in events and programs that celebrate and educate about the benefits of trade to the nation and the global economy.
