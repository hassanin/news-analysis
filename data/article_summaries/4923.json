On January 26, 2024, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, S. 3222, allows for safety and security exceptions for Senators regarding rented office space. The second bill, S. 3250, requires Federal courts to provide remote access to certain criminal court proceedings for victims and their relatives related to the Pan American Flight 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, which occurred on December 21, 1988. The President expressed gratitude to Senator Klobuchar for her leadership on the first bill, and Senators Cornyn and Gillibrand for their leadership on the second bill.
