This Presidential Memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama on January 31, 2014, aims to prevent the unfair denial of federal employment opportunities to individuals who are unemployed or facing financial difficulties through no fault of their own. The memorandum directs executive departments and agencies to not make negative determinations regarding the suitability, fitness, or qualifications of job applicants based on their unemployment status or financial difficulties, as long as the applicant has made a good-faith effort to meet their financial obligations. It also states that current federal employees should not be removed, suspended, or demoted due to financial difficulties if they have made a good-faith effort to fulfill their obligations. The memorandum requires agencies to review their recruitment and hiring practices to ensure they do not disadvantage applicants based on these factors and report the results to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) within 90 days. The OPM will then issue guidance to assist agencies in implementing this memorandum. The memorandum does not affect certain authorities granted by law or other obligations of federal employees, and its implementation is subject to applicable law and the availability of funds. It also states that it does not create any rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities. The Director of OPM is authorized to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
