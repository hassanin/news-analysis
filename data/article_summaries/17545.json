The White House has released a report on the health impacts of climate change on Americans. The report highlights the increased risk that climate change poses to individuals with asthma and other illnesses. It also discusses the rise in extreme weather events, such as heavy rain, heat waves, droughts, and wildfires, across the country. The effects of climate change disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and children. The President believes it is our moral obligation to protect future generations from a polluted and damaged planet. While no single action can reverse climate change, the government is taking steps to cut carbon pollution and protect public health. This includes the implementation of carbon pollution standards for existing power plants. The goal is to create a cleaner and more stable environment while also stimulating the economy.
