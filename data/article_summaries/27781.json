First Lady Melania Trump has directed the addition of the White House movie theater to the East Wing tour route. She believes that everyone who visits the White House should have access to its history and traditions. The movie theater was converted from the East Terrace cloakroom in 1942, and underwent renovations in 1982-1983 and 2004-2005. To celebrate the opening, the White House Visitors Office distributed White House candy to children and spoke with visitors. Public tours of the White House must be requested through one's Member of Congress and are available on specific days and times.
