President Obama has declared a major disaster in Tennessee and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts following the wildfires that occurred between November 28 and December 9, 2016. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in Sevier County, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to assist with recovery. Federal funding is also available to state and local governments and certain nonprofit organizations for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures. W. Michael Moore has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are still ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated in the future. Residents and business owners can apply for assistance by registering online or calling the provided toll-free numbers. Further information can be obtained by contacting the FEMA News Desk.
