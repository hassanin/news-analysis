On May 22, 2003, President Barack Obama declared a national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq. This was done to address the threat to national security and foreign policy posed by obstacles to the reconstruction, peace, security, and development of Iraq. Over the years, the scope of this national emergency has been modified through various executive orders. As the obstacles to Iraq's reconstruction and development continue to pose a threat to national security, President Obama has decided to continue the national emergency for one more year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
