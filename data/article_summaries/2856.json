President Biden held a summit at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to discuss efforts in defeating COVID-19 and preparing for future pandemics. The summit focused on three key areas: ramping up vaccine production, donations, delivery, and administration; addressing the global oxygen crisis in hospitals and improving access to treatments and public health tools; and strengthening global health security infrastructure. President Biden announced that the United States will be buying an additional half billion doses of Pfizer vaccine to donate to low- and middle-income countries, bringing the total commitment of donated vaccines to over 1.1 billion. He emphasized the need for high-income countries to fulfill their vaccine donation pledges and announced the launch of the EU-U.S. vaccine partnership. The President also highlighted the importance of increasing global vaccine manufacturing capacity, enhancing transparency, and providing support for administering and delivering vaccines. The United States will be providing additional funding for vaccine distribution and to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. President Biden emphasized the need to prepare for future pandemics and acknowledged the role of non-governmental partners in solving the challenges of vaccine availability, oxygen supply, and health security. He concluded by stating that the United States will continue to lead in vaccine donations and invest in global health security, but emphasized the need for collective action from all stakeholders.
