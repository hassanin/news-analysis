President Trump signed into law legislation that increases defense spending to a record $716 billion. This includes the largest pay raise for military personnel in almost a decade. The law also provides funding for the purchase of 93 new F-35 Lightning Joint Strike Fighters, 142 Apache and Black Hawk helicopters, and 13 Navy battle force ships, all made in the USA. Additionally, the law secures funding for border security, including $1.6 billion for the construction of a border wall. It also allocates funds for school safety, school choice, veterans vocational education, and substance abuse and mental health treatment. President Trump believes that these actions are helping to rebuild the military and protect the American people.
