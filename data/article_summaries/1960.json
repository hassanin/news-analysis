President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to Belarus, which was declared in Executive Order 13405 in 2006 and expanded in Executive Order 14038 in 2021, is to continue beyond June 16, 2023. The President believes that the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other individuals, as well as the regime's harmful activities and long-standing abuses, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
