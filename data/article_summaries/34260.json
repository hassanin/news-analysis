The article, written by Kimberley Strassel in The Wall Street Journal, criticizes the Democrats' approach to the impeachment inquiry against President Trump. The author argues that Democrats are controlling the narrative by keeping their witnesses locked behind closed doors and selectively leaking information to the press. They also highlight how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's refusal to hold a vote on the impeachment inquiry allows Democrats to avoid accountability. The article accuses House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of making up the rules as he goes along and acting as the "Lord High Impeacher." The author suggests that Democrats have learned from their failed Russia-collusion narrative and are now focused on maintaining control and avoiding embarrassing spectacles. The article also mentions that Schiff is withholding official documents and preventing Republicans from knowing what questions he is asking. Overall, the article portrays the impeachment inquiry as a one-sided narrative being controlled by the Democrats.
