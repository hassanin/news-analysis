President Biden has taken action to address the economic threat posed by the climate crisis. Extreme weather events caused by climate change can disrupt supply chains, deprive communities of essential resources, and damage infrastructure. The agency actions resulting from the President's directive aim to protect the financial security of American families, businesses, and workers from climate-related financial risks. The Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk will help people understand how climate change can impact their financial security, strengthen the U.S. financial system, and inform decisions to mitigate climate risks. It emphasizes the importance of disclosing these risks to the public and empowering individuals to make informed financial decisions. The order also requires the federal government to take concrete steps to mitigate climate risks and protect workers' savings. It aims to create good-paying jobs and position the United States as a leader in the global economy. The order includes several key provisions: developing a comprehensive government-wide climate-risk strategy, encouraging financial regulators to assess climate-related financial risks, bolstering the resilience of life savings and pensions, modernizing federal lending and procurement practices, and reducing the risk of climate change to the federal budget.
