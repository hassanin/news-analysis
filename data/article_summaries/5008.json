President Joe Biden has signed a National Security Memorandum to address illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and related harmful fishing practices. IUU fishing poses a significant threat to ocean health and contributes to global overfishing, impacting economies, food systems, and ecosystems worldwide. Distant water fishing vessels, engaged in industrial-scale fishing operations, are often responsible for IUU fishing and associated labor abuses such as forced labor and human trafficking. These activities undermine U.S. economic competitiveness, national security, fisheries sustainability, and the livelihoods and human rights of fishers globally. The Biden Administration aims to combat IUU fishing by increasing coordination with stakeholders, utilizing existing authorities in conservation, labor, trade, economic, diplomatic, law enforcement, and national security realms. Additionally, the administration will take further actions to combat IUU fishing throughout the U.N. Ocean Conference. These efforts align with President Biden's initiatives to conserve and restore the ocean's health, including the designation of a new national marine sanctuary, phase-out of single-use plastics in national parks, the development of an Ocean Climate Action Plan, and an emphasis on environmental justice in ocean science and technology.
