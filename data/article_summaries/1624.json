President Biden is set to outline his vision and new agenda for advancing racial equity in America. He plans to take bold steps to address systemic racism and discrimination in various sectors, including housing and criminal justice. The actions he will take include directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to address racially discriminatory federal housing policies, ending the Department of Justice's use of private prisons, strengthening the relationship between the federal government and Tribal Nations, and combating xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. These actions build upon previous efforts by the Biden administration to promote racial justice, such as establishing a whole-of-government initiative to address racial equity and rolling back harmful policies from the previous administration. President Biden is also committed to working with Congress to pass legislation that advances racial equity, including increased funding for small businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Title I schools. Additionally, his American Rescue Plan aims to provide immediate relief to communities and families disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, particularly communities of color. The plan includes provisions to support frontline workers, extend unemployment insurance benefits, and provide relief to Native American communities and Tribes. President Biden will also sign executive actions to advance fair housing, reform the incarceration system by ending the use of private prisons, and reaffirm the federal government's commitment to Tribal sovereignty and consultation. Lastly, he will combat xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders by denouncing anti-Asian bias and discrimination and implementing measures to prevent hate crimes and harassment.
