This executive order, issued on January 14, 2021, aims to improve coordination and efficiency in federal wildland fire management. The order recognizes the need for a single focal point of responsibility for policy leadership and accountability for cost controls in this area. It emphasizes the importance of interagency coordination, particularly at the policy level, to reduce hazardous fuels and wildfire severity. The order establishes an interagency Wildland Fire Subcabinet, co-chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of the Interior, to promote coordinated and strategic wildland fire management actions. Within 90 days, the Subcabinet is tasked with identifying and recommending the coordination and consolidation of existing federal interagency working groups related to wildland fire management policy. Within 180 days, the Subcabinet must develop and implement a strategic plan addressing various issues, including the management of preparedness resources, post-wildfire rehabilitation, and the adoption of new technologies. The Subcabinet is also required to provide updates on the progress of the strategic plan to relevant agencies on an annual basis. The Department of Agriculture will provide administrative support for the Subcabinet, and federal land managers will consult with the Wildland Fire Leadership Council to effectively carry out the requirements of the order. The order is to be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
