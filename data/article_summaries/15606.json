On January 13, 2017, the White House released a notice stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Ukraine. This national emergency was initially declared on March 6, 2014, in response to the actions and policies of individuals undermining democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine. The national emergency was expanded through subsequent executive orders on March 16, 2014, and March 20, 2014, due to the actions of the Russian government in Ukraine, including the purported annexation of Crimea and the use of force. Additional measures were taken on December 19, 2014, to address the Russian occupation of Crimea. The White House determined that these actions and policies still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, therefore, the national emergency declared in 2014 must continue beyond March 6, 2017. The notice was published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
