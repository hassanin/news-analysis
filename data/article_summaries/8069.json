President Biden will announce new initiatives during the U.S.-ASEAN Summit to expand the U.S.-ASEAN Strategic Partnership. These initiatives reflect the administration's commitment to ASEAN's central role in the U.S. vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.

The U.S.-ASEAN Health Futures initiative aims to accelerate joint research, strengthen health system capacity, and develop human capital in health. The United States plans to provide up to $40 million for this effort, building on the $3.5 billion invested in supporting public health in ASEAN over the past 20 years. The initiative will address the current pandemic and strengthen ASEAN's ability to respond to future disease outbreaks.

The U.S.-ASEAN Climate Futures initiative will receive up to $20.5 million to tackle the climate crisis and work towards the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This initiative will focus on various activities related to climate change.

The U.S.-ASEAN Economic Futures initiative aims to promote economic growth and opportunity, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States plans to provide $10 million in new loans and additional funding to support U.S.-ASEAN cooperation on trade and innovation.

The Billion Futures initiative focuses on education and gender equality. The United States intends to provide $16 million in education-related loans, $1.5 million for English language teacher training, and up to $4 million in new funding to promote gender equality and equity.

President Biden looks forward to working with Congress to support these initiatives.
