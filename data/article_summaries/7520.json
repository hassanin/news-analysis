The UAW has announced that their union members have voted together to ratify their record contracts. These contracts include record raises, more paid leave, greater retirement security, and more rights and respect at work. The UAW's negotiations have also influenced other auto companies, such as Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, and Subaru, to announce significant wage increases. The UAW is striving to make all auto jobs good, middle-class jobs, and there is support for their efforts.
