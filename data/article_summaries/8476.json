Vice President Kamala Harris visited the Community Empowerment Association in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to discuss the issue of lead pipes and lead paint in homes. She emphasized the importance of clean water and clean air as basic rights for all people. Harris mentioned that up to 10 million homes in the US have lead pipes, and at least 24 million homes have lead paint. She highlighted the need for public education and collaboration with local leaders to address the issue. The government has allocated $50 billion to address lead in paint and pipes, which will be used for public education, testing, and removal of lead pipes. Harris emphasized that government assistance is necessary because many communities and individuals lack the resources to remove lead on their own. She emphasized that this is an issue of equity, public health, and education. Harris commended the work being done in Pittsburgh and stated that the goal is to remove all lead pipes within 10 years.
