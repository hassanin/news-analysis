Congressman John Adler expressed his support for the tax cut proposal negotiated between President Obama and Republican Senate Leaders. He believes it is the best deal that the President could have negotiated and that it will benefit middle-class families and small businesses. Although he acknowledges that the deal is not perfect, he believes that extending unemployment benefits and cutting taxes targeted at the middle class will help stimulate private sector growth and contribute to the nation's economic recovery. Adler also highlights the need for Congress to address the issue of Washington's spending problem and its impact on the federal deficit. He emphasizes the importance of finding ways to lower the national debt while discussing tax policy and extending unemployment benefits.
