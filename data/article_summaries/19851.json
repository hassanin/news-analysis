In a statement from July 29, 2009, the President thanked members of both the Senate and House of Representatives for their work on health insurance reform. He expressed gratitude for their efforts to provide stability and security for those who already have insurance, as well as affordable coverage for those without. The President specifically acknowledged the work of some Blue Dogs on the Energy and Commerce Committee, who were actively seeking common ground to strengthen the legislation and reduce its cost.
