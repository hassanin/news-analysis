The Biden Administration is facilitating the air shipment of over 3.1 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula from England to New York. The flights are scheduled for July 17 and 22 and will transport approximately 200,000 pounds of Kendamil EU Classic First Infant Milk Stage 1 and Kendamil EU Organic First Infant Milk Stage 1. The formula will be available at Target stores. This initiative, called Operation Fly Formula, aims to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure its availability in stores. The Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, the General Services Administration, and the Department of Defense are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards. Additionally, the Biden Administration has taken other measures to ensure an adequate supply of safe infant formula, including invoking the Defense Production Act and issuing guidance for the safe import of formula.
