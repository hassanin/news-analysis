The article states that the national emergency with respect to the former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor has been extended for another year. This national emergency was declared in 2004 due to the actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others, which undermined Liberia's transition to democracy and its development. Despite Liberia's progress towards democracy and Charles Taylor's conviction for war crimes, the legacy of destruction left by him and others still poses a threat to the United States' foreign policy. Therefore, the national emergency and the measures adopted to deal with it will remain in effect beyond July 22, 2015.
