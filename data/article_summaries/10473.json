On June 18, 2010, President Obama traveled to Columbus, Ohio to mark the 10,000th Recovery Act road project. The road improvement project in downtown Columbus is expected to create over 300 construction jobs and contribute to economic development in the area around Nationwide Children's Hospital. The President was joined by Secretary LaHood and 8 construction workers on stage, and the audience consisted of elected officials and workers. Prior to his remarks, the President and Secretary LaHood met with the construction workers and received a brief tour of the project. Columbus and Franklin County received approximately $729 million in Recovery Act funding, including funding for small businesses, transportation projects, energy efficiency, public housing, and education grants. In Ohio as a whole, the Recovery Act created or saved 108,000 jobs and made over $12.6 billion available, with over $7.5 billion already spent. The Recovery Act also provided tax relief, expanded unemployment benefits, stimulus payments, and funding for education and Medicaid in Ohio. Law enforcement agencies in Ohio received over $79 million in funding from the Recovery Act to support police officers' salaries and benefits.
