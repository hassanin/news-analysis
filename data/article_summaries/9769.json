On the 39th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision, the President released a statement emphasizing the importance of protecting a woman's right to choose and the broader principle of government not interfering in private family matters. He acknowledged that abortion is a sensitive and divisive issue but called for unity in preventing unintended pregnancies, supporting pregnant women and mothers, reducing the need for abortion, promoting healthy relationships, and encouraging adoption. The President also stressed the need for equal rights, freedoms, and opportunities for daughters to achieve their dreams.
