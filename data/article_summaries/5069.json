The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, National Economic Council, and Domestic Policy Council held a meeting with over 80 federal and state officials to discuss the importance of reducing medical debt as part of President Biden's agenda to lower costs for American families. Approximately one in three adults in the US, which is nearly 100 million Americans, struggle with unpaid medical bills. Medical debt not only prevents people from obtaining loans but also hinders their ability to access medical services and afford basic necessities. President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that healthcare should be a right and that no one should have to go into debt to receive the necessary care. During the meeting, Administration officials emphasized the significance of addressing medical debt to reduce costs and improve the health and well-being of Americans. They also expressed gratitude to state leaders for their collaboration on this issue. State leaders from California, Colorado, and Washington shared their own efforts in tackling medical debt, including legislative successes in addressing medical payment products, unfair debt collection practices, surprise billing, facility fees, and charity care. This meeting is part of the ongoing commitment of the Biden-Harris Administration to lower healthcare costs.
