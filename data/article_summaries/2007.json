The White House recently held a meeting with governors and federal and state officials to address home heating costs for families this winter. The focus of the discussion was on the resources provided by the American Rescue Plan (ARP), including $4.5 billion in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Emergency Rental Assistance that can be used for utility bills. The meeting emphasized the importance of partnerships between federal, state, territorial, and tribal leaders to deliver benefits to Americans. The White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator provided an overview of the resources available to help families this winter. Several governors highlighted the innovative ways their states are coordinating and expediting benefits from the American Rescue Plan. Utility companies were also challenged to do their part, and seven major utilities companies and a trade association representing distributors of liquid fuels have already agreed to commitments to help eligible customers and provide relief to households in need.
