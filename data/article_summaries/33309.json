The United States is extending the national emergency declared in 2012 regarding the actions and policies of certain former members of the Government of Yemen. These individuals pose a threat to Yemen's peace, security, and stability, as well as the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The national emergency will continue for one year, as authorized by the National Emergencies Act. This extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
