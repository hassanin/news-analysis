In a statement, Alan Krueger, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, discusses the state of the economy and the need for further action to recover from the financial crisis and recession. He emphasizes the importance of continuing policies that support the middle class and create a stronger economy. The report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the economy added 84,000 private sector jobs in June, bringing the total to 4.4 million jobs added in the past 28 months. However, Krueger notes that job growth is not sufficient to make up for the jobs lost during the recession. The average work week for private sector workers increased slightly, and manufacturing employment continues to grow. Other sectors with job gains include temporary help services, leisure and hospitality, and wholesale trade. Retail trade, government, and education sectors experienced job losses. Krueger cautions against reading too much into one monthly report and advises considering other available data.
