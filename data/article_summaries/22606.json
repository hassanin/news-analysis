President Obama has issued a new Executive Order to implement and expand upon the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014. The order states that Venezuelan officials who violate the human rights of Venezuelan citizens and engage in public corruption will not be welcome in the United States, and their assets and use of US financial systems can be blocked. The US is deeply concerned about the Venezuelan government's efforts to escalate intimidation of its political opponents and criminalize dissent. The US government has consistently called on Venezuela to release political prisoners and improve the climate of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Venezuelan government is urged to release all political prisoners, engage in real dialogue, and live up to its commitment to democracy. The US remains committed to maintaining strong ties with the people of Venezuela and is open to improving its relationship with the Venezuelan government.
