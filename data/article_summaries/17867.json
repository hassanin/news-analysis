China has agreed to increase market access for U.S. movies to resolve issues related to films after the United States' victory in a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute. This agreement will allow more job-supporting U.S. film exports to China and provide fairer compensation to U.S. film producers. The Chinese film market is large and growing quickly, with last year's box office revenue reaching $2.1 billion. The agreement allows for more American exports of 3D, IMAX, and similar enhanced format movies on favorable terms and strengthens opportunities to distribute films through private enterprises. The agreement will be reviewed after 5 years, and the United States can seek relief from the WTO if necessary. Films and other audiovisual services are a key export sector for the United States, with a $12 billion trade surplus.
