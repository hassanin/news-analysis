The Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, wrote an op-ed for CNN emphasizing the importance of rural broadband access for farmers and rural communities. He mentioned that although the overall economy is booming, rural America has not kept pace. In April 2017, President Trump signed an executive order establishing the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity, which Perdue chaired. The task force identified over 100 actions that the federal government should consider undertaking to ensure growth in rural areas, with improved high-speed internet access being the overarching need. Perdue emphasized the importance of incentivizing private capital investment and streamlining processes to increase broadband access in rural areas. He invited readers to read the task force's final report and join in the effort to support rural America.
