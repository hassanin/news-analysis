President Barack Obama has proclaimed June 2014 as National Oceans Month in the United States. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of the oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes as natural treasures that provide food, energy, and a foundation for our way of life. These bodies of water also contribute to our economy, transportation, and national security. President Obama highlights the need to protect and conserve these ecosystems by reducing pollution, preventing habitat loss, supporting sustainable fisheries, and preparing for the impacts of climate change. The National Ocean Policy aims to improve coordination, efficiency, information sharing, and ecosystem-scale planning and management. The Federal Government is collaborating with states and tribes to support local communities in finding solutions that work best for them. The proclamation calls upon Americans to take action to protect, conserve, and restore our oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.
