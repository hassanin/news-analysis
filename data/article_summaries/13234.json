President Obama has announced that seven solar and wind energy projects will be expedited as part of the We Can't Wait initiative. These projects, located in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Wyoming, would produce nearly 5,000 megawatts of clean energy, enough to power approximately 1.5 million homes. The Office of Management and Budget is overseeing a government-wide effort to make the permitting and review process for infrastructure projects more efficient. The Department of the Interior has approved more utility-scale renewable energy projects on public lands in the past three years than in the past two decades combined. The projects include wind farms in Arizona and Wyoming, solar power plants in Arizona and California, and a solar project on tribal lands in Nevada.
