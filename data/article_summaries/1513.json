President Biden has signed an executive order to enable certain assets of Afghanistan's central bank, Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), to be used for the benefit of the Afghan people. The order will block DAB's property held in the United States by US financial institutions and require them to transfer the assets into a consolidated account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The administration aims to facilitate access to $3.5 billion of these assets for the Afghan people, pending a judicial decision. However, there are ongoing legal claims by US victims of terrorism against DAB's assets, so a further court decision is needed to determine the scope of those claims. Even if funds are transferred for the benefit of the Afghan people, more than $3.5 billion in DAB assets would remain in the US and subject to litigation. The executive order aims to prevent the Taliban and other malicious actors from accessing the funds. The US will continue to work with the international community to provide humanitarian assistance and support to the Afghan people amidst the economic challenges exacerbated by the Taliban's takeover of the country.
