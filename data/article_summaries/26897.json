According to the advance estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), real GDP grew above market expectations in the second quarter of 2019. Consumer spending was a key driver of this growth, rising 4.3 percent at an annual rate. However, the growth rate in the second quarter was lower than in the first quarter, partly due to issues at Boeing, which subtracted 0.4 percentage point from growth. Adjusting for these issues, growth in 2019 so far is estimated to be 2.8 percent at an annual rate. Without adjusting for Boeing's problems, growth is at 2.6 percent, which exceeds the growth projected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) for 2019. Real private domestic final purchases (PDFP), which include consumer spending and fixed investment, grew 3.2 percent in the second quarter, signaling positive growth for the next quarter. In addition, the BEA revised upward the growth figures for the first quarter of 2019, with real gross domestic income growth tripling from 1 percent to 3.2 percent, largely due to higher wages and salaries.
