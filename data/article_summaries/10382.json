President Obama has announced the appointment of 15 individuals to serve as White House Fellows for the 2009-2010 class. The Fellows come from various professions including medicine, business, media, education, non-profit, state government, and the military. The program was created in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson to provide promising leaders with firsthand experience in the workings of the Federal government and to increase their sense of participation in national affairs. The Fellows also participate in an education program to broaden their knowledge of leadership, policy formulation, military operations, and current affairs. Community service is an important component of the program, and Fellows participate in service projects throughout the year in the Washington, DC area. The selection process is highly competitive and based on professional achievement, leadership potential, commitment to public service, and knowledge and skills necessary to contribute at the highest levels of the Federal government. The White House Fellows program has produced leaders in various fields including government, business, media, and academia.
