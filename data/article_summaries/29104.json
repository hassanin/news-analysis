President Donald J. Trump has fulfilled his promise to the American people by releasing the final Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule. This rule aims to provide safer and cleaner cars while saving American families thousands of dollars in new vehicle costs. The previous administration's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) and CO2 emissions standards were deemed unattainable by car companies and consumer advocates, making new vehicles too expensive for many Americans. Consequently, people were forced to continue driving older, more dangerous, and less environmentally friendly vehicles. The SAFE Vehicles Rule not only addresses these issues but also improves air quality in the United States and protects the jobs of American autoworkers. President Trump commends the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency for countering radical Green New Deal environmental activists and implementing the largest deregulatory action of his presidency. According to NHTSA research, the new realistic standards are projected to result in 2.7 million additional new vehicles sold, 3,300 fewer crash fatalities, 397,000 fewer automobile-related injuries, over 1.8 million fewer vehicles damaged in crashes, and reduced technology costs ranging from $86 to $126 billion by 2029.
