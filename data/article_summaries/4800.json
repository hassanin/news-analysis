President Biden has announced that the United States will be sharing at least 80 million COVID-19 vaccine doses globally by the end of June. The plan includes sharing 75% of the doses through COVAX, which aims to distribute vaccines equitably, prioritizing Latin America and the Caribbean, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa. The remaining 25% will be shared directly with countries in need and those experiencing surges. The first tranche of 25 million doses will be allocated based on the framework outlined. The U.S. government is committed to expediting the process while ensuring the safe and secure transport of vaccines across international borders. The specific vaccines and amounts will be determined as the administration works through logistical and regulatory requirements for each region and country.
