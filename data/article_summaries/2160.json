Robert Parris Moses, an educator and organizer, dedicated his life to fighting for justice, equality, and the right to vote. In 1961, he traveled to Mississippi, fully aware of the risks involved, including jail time and violence. Despite these challenges, he persisted in his efforts to help Black voters who faced poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation. He registered thousands of voters and trained young organizers to do the same. Mr. Moses also recognized the importance of mathematics literacy in economic empowerment and founded the Algebra Project to provide knowledge and opportunities to underserved students. His legacy should be honored by continuing the fight for justice, equality, and voting rights.
