In a press briefing, Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, Francis Cissna, discussed the attempted suicide bombing in New York and how it was enabled by flaws in the immigration system. He explained the different categories of immigration, including family-based and employment-based, and highlighted the vulnerabilities of the diversity visa program. Cissna emphasized the need for a more selective immigration system that ensures the success and assimilation of immigrants. In addition to this, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders addressed questions about President Trump's tweet regarding Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, stating that it was not a sexual innuendo but rather a criticism of the broken political system. Sanders also discussed the President's call for a clean funding bill to support the military and criticized Congress for not focusing on the priorities of the American people.
