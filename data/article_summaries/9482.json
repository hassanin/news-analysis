On January 27, 2010, the President signed into law S. 2949, also known as the "Emergency Aid to American Survivors of the Haiti Earthquake Act of 2010." This law increases the cap for fiscal year 2010 on the amount that the Department of Health and Human Services may spend for the provision of assistance to repatriated U.S. citizens from $1 million to $25 million. It also increases the funding for the Medicaid Qualified Individual program by $65 million for the year 2010. However, the law also reduces the Medicaid Improvement Fund by $90 million.
