On Tuesday, President Obama will meet with the Cavalier family in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He will then host a backyard discussion with neighbors and families from the area. This is part of the President's initiative to listen to families' concerns and find ways to create jobs and strengthen the middle class. The Cavalier family consists of Andy Cavalier, a retired Marine Corps staff sergeant and disabled veteran, and Etta Cavalier, a public school educator. They have six children and eight grandchildren. Elected officials expected to attend the event include Governor Bill Richardson, Representative Martin Heinrich, and Lt. Governor Diane Denish.
