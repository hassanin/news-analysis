He emphasizes the need for action and the President's commitment to both short-term measures for job creation and long-term measures for deficit reduction. Carney also addresses concerns about the Solyndra loan guarantee and the administration's handling of it, stating that the urgency was due to a scheduling matter. He defends the need for investments in clean energy technology and highlights the importance of the loan guarantee program.
