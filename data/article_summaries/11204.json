The Peace Corps and VSO (Voluntary Service Overseas) have formed a partnership to promote global development through volunteerism. Both organizations have a long history of fighting poverty and empowering marginalized communities. The partnership aims to leverage the resources and networks of both organizations to create lasting change. They will collaborate on development priorities such as education, health, HIV/AIDS, youth development, gender, climate change, and citizen participation. The partnership includes organizational-level collaboration in areas such as recruitment, monitoring and evaluation, programming, and training. It also includes country-level collaboration in countries where both organizations work, such as Tanzania, the Philippines, Nepal, and Vanuatu. The goal is to enhance the effectiveness of both organizations and address urgent development challenges. The Peace Corps, established by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, has sent over 200,000 volunteers to 139 host countries. VSO is a development organization that fights poverty through volunteers, focusing on skills and knowledge sharing. They recruit volunteers from 10 countries to work in 37 countries.
