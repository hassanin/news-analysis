President Barack Obama will award Specialist Leslie H. Sabo, Jr., the Medal of Honor posthumously for his heroic actions in combat on May 10, 1970, in Cambodia. Sabo charged the enemy position, killing several enemy soldiers, and successfully drew enemy fire away from friendly soldiers. He shielded a wounded comrade with his own body, absorbing the blast from an enemy grenade and saving his comrade's life. Despite being wounded, Sabo continued to charge the enemy's bunker and threw a grenade into it, ending the enemy fire but losing his own life. His courageous actions saved the lives of many of his platoon members. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who display gallantry above and beyond the call of duty in actions against enemies of the United States or in military operations involving conflict with opposing foreign forces. The conduct must involve great personal bravery or self-sacrifice and must have involved risk of life.
