On May 29, 2015, the White House issued a statement regarding the signing of three laws by the President. The first law, H.R. 1690, designates a courthouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as the Joseph F. Weis Jr. United States Courthouse. The second law, H.R. 2353, known as the "Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015," extends funding for various transportation programs financed by the Highway Trust Fund until July 31, 2015. It also grants authority to make expenditures from the Highway Trust Fund and deposit tax revenues into it. The third law, S. 178, known as the "Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015," makes amendments to several laws administered by the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security to support victims of human trafficking and combat human trafficking crimes.
