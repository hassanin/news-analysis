The ongoing conflict in northern Ethiopia is causing immense human suffering and poses a threat to the unity of the country. Nearly one million people are facing famine-like conditions, and millions more are at risk of acute food insecurity due to the violence. Humanitarian workers have been hindered, harassed, and killed, and there are reports of mass murder, rape, and other forms of sexual violence targeting civilians. The United States is committed to promoting a peaceful resolution to the conflict and will support mediation efforts led by the African Union High Representative for the Horn of Africa, Olusegun Obasanjo. The US agrees with the United Nations and African Union leaders that there is no military solution to this crisis. Leaders from Africa and around the world are urging the parties involved to stop their military campaigns, respect human rights, allow unrestricted humanitarian access, and engage in negotiations without preconditions. Eritrean forces must withdraw from Ethiopia. The US will continue to push for a negotiated ceasefire, an end to abuses against civilians, and access to humanitarian aid. The signed Executive Order establishes a new sanctions regime to target those responsible for prolonging the conflict, obstructing humanitarian access, or preventing a ceasefire. The US remains committed to supporting the people of Ethiopia and strengthening the ties between the two countries. The sanctions are directed at individuals and entities perpetrating violence and causing a humanitarian disaster, not the people of Ethiopia or Eritrea. The US provides significant humanitarian and development assistance to Ethiopia, benefiting all regions, and will continue to work with partners to address the needs of at-risk populations in Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa.
