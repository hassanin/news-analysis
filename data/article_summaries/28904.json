The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) announced the addition of Logan, Simpson, and Clark counties to the Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program. This designation provides the counties with access to HIDTA resources and greater law enforcement coordination to combat illicit drug trafficking in the region. ONDCP Director Jim Carroll joined Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky to recognize this addition and emphasized the importance of the fight against illegal drug trafficking, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. The HIDTA program, created in 1988, coordinates and assists federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies in addressing regional drug threats and reducing drug trafficking and production in the United States. There are currently 33 regional HIDTAs across the country.
