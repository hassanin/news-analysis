Vice President Mike Pence led a discussion with the chief executives of approximately 50 states, territories, and Washington, DC, along with state emergency managers and health officials, to provide an update on the US government's response to COVID-19. The discussion focused on the all-of-America approach to mitigate the effects of the virus. Participants highlighted the importance of community mitigation efforts and discussed the federal government's support for state and local leaders, including approving major disaster declaration and Title 32 requests. The $150 billion in CARES Act funding for states to respond to COVID-19 was also emphasized. The federal government's supply chain support, expansion of telehealth options, and increasing testing capacity were discussed. The actions of Oregon and Washington in donating ventilators to help other states were praised. The leadership of governors, mayors, county commissioners, and tribal officials was recognized as vital for effective emergency management. The Trump Administration has held numerous briefings with state, local, and tribal leaders since January 2020.
