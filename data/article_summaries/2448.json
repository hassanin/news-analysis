During the U.S.-African Leaders Summit, the United States reaffirmed its partnerships with African governments, the private sector, civil society, and philanthropic actors to address the challenge of climate change. The U.S. plans to provide over $150 million in new funding to accelerate the President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE) at the United Nations Climate Meeting. President Biden emphasized the U.S. commitment to helping vulnerable countries and communities in Africa adapt to and manage the impacts of climate change. Since January 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration has invested and plans to provide at least $1.1 billion to support African-led efforts for conservation, climate adaptation, and a just energy transition. These investments include infrastructure projects under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII).
