President Obama signed the National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act into law, ensuring that the federal government can provide timely drought warning forecasts and support to vulnerable communities. The legislation is important as climate change intensifies weather-related disasters such as droughts, wildfires, storms, and floods. The National Integrated Drought Information System provides tools and data for informed decision-making on water use, crop planting, wildfire response, and other critical areas. The President's Climate Action Plan includes the formation of a National Drought Resilience Partnership to help communities better prepare for droughts in the long term. The President commends Congress for passing this bipartisan bill to enhance national resilience to drought and assist communities, farmers, businesses, and individuals in preparing for and recovering from disasters.
