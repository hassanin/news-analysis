The Vice President spoke about the need for affordable childcare in the country. She mentioned that President Biden signed an executive order to improve access to care and support caregivers. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Program (CCDBG) was discussed, which benefits over 900,000 working families and 1.5 million children. However, many families still pay significant out-of-pocket costs for childcare. The Vice President proposed capping co-pays at no more than 7% of a family's income, which would result in savings for families. The administration also encourages states to eliminate co-pays for low-income families and streamline the application process. Additionally, efforts are being made to ensure that childcare providers are paid fairly and promptly. The Vice President emphasized that affordable childcare allows parents to work, pursue education, and secure a better future, while also benefiting children's long-term success. The high cost of childcare was highlighted, with some families spending a significant portion of their income on it. The Vice President shared her personal experience of relying on childcare as a child and stressed the importance of making childcare accessible to all families. The administration's goal is to make childcare more affordable and expand access to high-quality preschool.
