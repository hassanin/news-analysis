President Obama, in partnership with Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei and President of the Republic of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, has proposed the U.S.-Asia Pacific Comprehensive Partnership for a Sustainable Energy Future. This partnership aims to consolidate and expand energy and environmental cooperation in the Asia Pacific region. It will build upon existing energy initiatives and promote greater energy connectivity and integration. The partnership will focus on renewables and cleaner energy, markets and interconnectivity, the emerging role of natural gas, and sustainable development. The United States will provide up to $6 billion in support, including export credit financing, financing for sustainable power and energy infrastructure projects, and assistance programs in power generation and distribution. The partnership will work closely with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Brunei, as Chair of ASEAN, and Indonesia, as Chair of APEC, will play key roles in advancing energy and sustainability cooperation.
