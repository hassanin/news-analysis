The White House has released a statement expressing disappointment and concern over Uganda's new law that criminalizes homosexuality. The statement criticizes President Museveni for taking a step backward in terms of freedom, justice, and equal rights. It emphasizes that the law not only poses a danger to the gay community in Uganda but also reflects poorly on the country's commitment to protecting human rights. The statement also highlights the potential negative impact on public health, particularly efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. The White House pledges to continue urging the Ugandan government to repeal the law and advocate for the protection of LGBT rights both in Uganda and globally.
