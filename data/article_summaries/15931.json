President Obama met with the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies to discuss the report they submitted on December 13. The President expressed his expectation that intelligence collection should protect national security, respect privacy and civil liberties, and maintain public trust. He thanked the group for their work and outlined how he intends to utilize their recommendations. The President will study the report and consult with his national security team to determine which recommendations to implement. He will also consult with Congress on reform proposals. In January, the President plans to speak to the American people and the international community about the outcomes of their work and their plans to address the Review Group's recommendations.
