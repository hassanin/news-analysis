On March 11, 2009, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum regarding the urgent refugee and migration needs resulting from the continuing conflict in Pakistan. The President determined that it is in the national interest to provide assistance under the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962. An amount not exceeding $8 million was allocated from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund. This assistance will be used to address unexpected and urgent refugee and migration needs, including contributions to international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, as well as administrative expenses of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration of the Department of State. The memorandum was authorized to be published in the Federal Register.
