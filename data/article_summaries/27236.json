This article discusses President Donald J. Trump's plan to change the immigration policy regarding asylum seekers. Under the new policy, illegal aliens will no longer be able to enter the country by making meritless claims for asylum. Instead, migrants seeking asylum will have to present themselves lawfully at a port of entry. The Trump Administration believes that this change is necessary to protect national sovereignty and uphold the rule of law. They argue that the current asylum system is overwhelmed by fraud and abuse, contributing to the border crisis.
