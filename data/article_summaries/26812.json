The Trump administration is committed to free and fair trade and is determined to counter protectionist policies of other nations. The administration believes that many countries express commitment to free markets while engaging in unfair trading practices that disadvantage American workers and businesses. Examples of unfair practices include imposing tariffs, erecting barriers to American exports, and maintaining trade surpluses. China and Europe are specifically mentioned as countries that enforce nontariff trade barriers and provide government support to their exports. The Trump administration aims to restore a level playing field in international trade and is working towards better deals with trading partners.
