President Trump delivered a speech on the South Lawn of the White House to celebrate and expand his campaign to rescue American workers from job-killing regulations. He highlighted the regulatory relief efforts of his administration, stating that for every one new regulation issued, two federal regulations have been permanently removed. Trump claimed that his administration has removed nearly 25,000 pages of job-destroying regulations, more than any other president in history. He also mentioned the economic benefits of these regulatory reforms, such as increased household income and savings, lower vehicle prices, and reduced energy costs. Trump criticized the Democrats' plans to reimpose regulations and their proposals to abolish the suburbs, defund the police, and implement the Green New Deal. He also introduced and praised several governors who have supported his deregulation agenda.
