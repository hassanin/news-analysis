President Obama will be welcoming the United States Naval Academy Football Team to the White House on April 12th to present them with the 2012 Commander in Chief's Trophy. The trophy is awarded to the service academy with the best overall record against the other two service academies. Since 1984, the President has personally presented the Trophy to the victorious Academy's football team at the White House, with the exception of 1993. This event will be open to the press, and media members interested in covering the event must send their information to media_affairs@who.eop.gov by April 10th. Media members without a White House hard pass will need to provide additional personal information. Confirmation and further instructions will be sent if the request for credentials is accommodated.
