The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has been relieved of her duties by President Trump for refusing to enforce a legal order aimed at protecting the citizens of the United States. The order, which calls for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven dangerous places, was approved by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel. President Trump has named Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, as the Acting Attorney General until Senator Jeff Sessions is confirmed. Boente has stated that he will defend and enforce the laws of the country to ensure the protection of the people and the nation.
