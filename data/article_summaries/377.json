The article discusses the importance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) in the United States and the need to support them. Hispanic students make up nearly 20 percent of college undergraduates in the country and are seen as the future leaders in various fields. HSIs provide a nurturing and inclusive environment for Hispanic students to learn and grow. However, HSIs have faced challenges in recent years, with a decline in enrollment and the number of institutions. To support these institutions, the Biden administration has invested approximately $11 billion from the American Rescue Plan to keep students and staff safe during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide emergency grants to students. Additionally, the administration has increased the maximum Pell Grant award and is providing debt relief to address the financial burdens of the pandemic. The administration is also working to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and has established the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics. The article concludes by stating the administration's proposal to double the maximum Pell Grant amount by 2029 and requesting increased funding from Congress to support HSIs and other minority-serving institutions. The National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week is proclaimed to honor and support the contributions of these institutions and their graduates to the country.
