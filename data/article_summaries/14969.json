The article discusses the signing of the STOCK Act by President Obama. The STOCK Act is a bipartisan bill that prevents Members of Congress from trading stocks based on nonpublic information they obtained while on Capitol Hill. The Act also increases transparency in financial disclosure reporting by requiring a shift to electronic reporting and online availability of public financial disclosure information. It introduces new ethics requirements such as expanding pension forfeiture for corrupt Members, requiring disclosure of terms of mortgages, banning special access to Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), and requiring a report on the role of political intelligence firms in the financial markets. Additionally, the Act bans bonuses for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives during any period of conservatorship after enactment.
