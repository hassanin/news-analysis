President Donald J. Trump posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Babe Zaharias, along with previously announced recipients Annika Sorenstam and Gary J. Player. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian honor in the United States, given to individuals who have made significant contributions to the country's security, national interests, world peace, or cultural endeavors. Zaharias, who grew up in poverty in Texas, excelled in multiple sports, including baseball, swimming, basketball, and golf. She set world records in the hurdles, javelin throw, and high jump at the 1932 Olympics, winning two gold medals and one silver. Despite being diagnosed with cancer in 1953 and undergoing surgery, Zaharias went on to win 10 major championships and numerous tournaments in golf. She also played against men in a PGA Tour event and helped found the L.P.G.A. Zaharias passed away at the age of 45 but left a lasting legacy in women's golf.
