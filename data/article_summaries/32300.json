The Council of Economic Advisers has released its annual Economic Report of the President, stating that the US economy has continued to outperform expectations since the 2016 election. The report attributes this success to policies such as tax cuts, deregulation, energy independence, and trade renegotiation. The report also highlights the administration's focus on pro-market reforms in tax, labor, regulation, energy, and healthcare policy. Despite challenges such as a slowing global economy, the US economy has remained resilient, with indicators like consumer spending, productivity, and labor shares of income growing at elevated rates. The unemployment rate has reached a 50-year low, and wage gains have been observed for historically disadvantaged Americans. The report also emphasizes the positive impact of the administration's regulatory reform agenda, estimating that it will raise real incomes by $3,100 per household per year. Additionally, embracing energy innovation and focusing on consumer choice and competition in healthcare have been highlighted as successful approaches. The report acknowledges potential obstacles to economic growth, such as the opioid crisis and housing unaffordability, and calls for further action in these areas. Overall, assuming full implementation of the administration's economic policy agenda, the report projects a 3.1 percent growth in real US economic output in 2020 and an average annual pace of 2.9 percent between 2019 and 2030. The report concludes by stating that there is still work to be done to increase economic growth and opportunity in the US.
