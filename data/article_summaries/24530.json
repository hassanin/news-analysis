President Barack Obama has submitted a letter to the House and Senate leadership, as well as the chairmen and ranking members of House and Senate committees, regarding a report on Afghanistan and Pakistan. The letter is in response to section 1117 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, and is aimed at keeping Congress fully informed. This is the third report submitted under section 1117, with the previous one being submitted in September 2010. The report covers the period from July 1, 2010, through December 31, 2010, and provides an update on the progress made since that time. In December, the Obama Administration conducted a comprehensive review of progress against core policy objectives in Afghanistan and Pakistan during 2010. The report also evaluates the progress made during the period covered, which saw the full deployment of the U.S. troop surge to Afghanistan that was announced in December 2009.
