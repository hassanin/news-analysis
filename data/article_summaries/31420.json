The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released a statement in response to the 2020 Monitoring the Future (MTF) study, which tracks youth substance misuse during the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement acknowledges that rates of youth substance misuse in 2020, before the COVID-19 state of emergency, are similar to those in 2019. The Trump Administration has dedicated significant resources to educating the youth about the dangers of illicit substance use. While there has not been an increase in substance use over the past year, the statement emphasizes the need to remain vigilant and mindful of the impact of the pandemic on youth and families. The MTF study shows that rates of illicit substance use among youth in 2020 remained similar to those in 2019, with no statistically significant change in marijuana vaping rates. However, there was a significant decrease in rates of daily marijuana vaping among 10th graders. The MTF study is an ongoing survey conducted by the Institute for Social Research Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan.
