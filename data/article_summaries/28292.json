Small Business Saturday, which encourages consumers to support local businesses, has been successful in driving traffic to independent stores and e-commerce sites. A survey by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) found that 108 million consumers shopped or dined at local businesses on Small Business Saturday in 2017, with 90 percent of consumers agreeing that the event has a positive impact on their community. This year, Small Business Saturday has the potential to be even more successful, with the National Retail Federation forecasting holiday retail sales to increase between 4.3 and 4.8 percent. The strong economy and high consumer optimism, fueled by factors such as low unemployment rates and tax cuts, are contributing to this growth. Small businesses play a crucial role in job creation and economic prosperity, with two out of three net new jobs in the private sector being created by them. Supporting small businesses not only benefits the local economy but also invigorates neighborhoods and cities.
