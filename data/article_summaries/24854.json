The article discusses the U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement signed on May 1, 2012. The agreement aims to define the future relationship between the two countries after the completion of the drawdown of U.S. forces. It seeks to strengthen Afghan sovereignty, stability, and prosperity, as well as contribute to the shared goal of defeating Al Qaeda and its affiliates. The agreement includes commitments in areas such as promoting democratic values, advancing long-term security, reinforcing regional security and cooperation, social and economic development, and strengthening Afghan institutions and governance. It also establishes arrangements and mechanisms to ensure effective implementation. The agreement allows for the possibility of U.S. forces in Afghanistan after 2014 for training Afghan forces and targeting remnants of Al Qaeda. However, it does not commit the United States to any specific troop levels or funding, as those decisions will be made in consultation with the U.S. Congress. The agreement also designates Afghanistan as a "Major Non-NATO Ally" and initiates negotiations on a Bilateral Security Agreement to supersede the current Status of Forces Agreement.
