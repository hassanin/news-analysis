On April 16, 2010, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation declaring April 19, 2010, as the National Day of Service and Remembrance for Victims and Survivors of Terrorism. The proclamation highlighted the importance of remembering victims of terrorism both at home and abroad, honoring the heroes who support them, and working towards creating a world that is worthy of their legacy. The proclamation specifically mentioned the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and the September 11 attacks in 2001 as examples of acts of terrorism that prompted an outpouring of support from the American people. It emphasized that terrorists prey on the innocent and have nothing to offer except hatred and destruction, and that their actions impact not only their direct victims but also the families, friends, and fellow citizens of those targeted. The proclamation recognized the extraordinary acts of courage, love, faith, and commitment displayed by survivors of terrorism and their families, who have come together to speak out against violent ideologies, help survivors heal, and give hope to those affected by acts of terrorism. The proclamation called upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag at half-staff on April 19, 2010, in honor of the individuals who lost their lives as a result of terrorism. It also invited governors, organizations, and individuals to join in this observance and encouraged all Americans to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and acts of community service in memory of the victims and survivors of terrorism worldwide.
