President Obama expressed deep disappointment that the Paycheck Fairness Act was prevented from being debated and voted on by a minority of Senators. The bill, which had already passed in the House two years prior, had the support of the majority of Senate and the majority of Americans. The President believes that this bill would have ensured that women and their families receive equal pay and would have helped businesses that pay equal wages to compete against discriminatory competition. Despite the setback, the Administration will continue to fight for equal pay for women.
