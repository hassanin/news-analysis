The White House has announced a series of measures in response to Russian cyber attacks and harassment. The actions include sanctions against Russian intelligence services, individuals, and companies, as well as the closure of two Russian-owned compounds in the US. The White House also released a Joint Analysis Report (JAR) that provides details on the tools and infrastructure used by Russian intelligence services to compromise US networks. The report aims to help network defenders identify and disrupt Russian cyber activities. The actions are seen as a response to Russia's interference in the US election and its pattern of harassment towards US diplomats. The White House believes that Russia will continue to interfere in democratic elections in other countries.
