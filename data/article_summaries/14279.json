President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation recognizing October 11, 2016, as General Pulaski Memorial Day. The day is meant to honor Casimir Pulaski, a Polish immigrant who fought for the United States during the Revolutionary War. Pulaski rose to the rank of Brigadier General in the Continental Army and played a crucial role in reforming the cavalry and saving the life of General George Washington. He died from battle injuries on October 11, 1779. The proclamation acknowledges the contributions of Polish Americans to the country and encourages Americans to commemorate the occasion with appropriate programs and activities.
