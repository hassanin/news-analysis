Second Lady Karen Pence will be traveling to Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City, Panama from August 13-18, 2017. During her trip, she will observe art therapy sessions and participate in roundtable discussions with art therapists. The purpose of her visit is to bring awareness to the profession of art therapy and its benefits in Central and South America. Art therapy is a mental health profession that uses art making to improve physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Art therapists use art media and the creative process to explore feelings, reconcile emotional conflicts, foster self-awareness, manage behavior, develop social skills, and more.
