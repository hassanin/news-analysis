The Biden-Harris Administration has released the National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, which aims to safely move the country forward and fight COVID-19 as Americans return to their normal routines. As part of this plan, the Administration is launching the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, which calls on building owners and operators, schools, colleges, universities, and organizations to adopt strategies to improve indoor air quality and reduce the spread of COVID-19. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published a best practices guide in collaboration with other federal agencies, providing recommendations for improving indoor air quality. The guide includes actionable steps that building owners can take, along with resources for planning long-term improvements. The Biden Administration and Congress have allocated federal funds to support improvements in indoor air quality, including in schools and public buildings. These funds can be used for ventilation and filtration upgrades, as well as other improvements like purchasing air filtration units, repairing windows and doors, and upgrading HVAC systems. The Administration will also continue to prioritize indoor air quality in buildings as part of their overall COVID-19 preparedness plan.
