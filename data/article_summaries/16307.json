President Obama has signed an emergency declaration for Puerto Rico in response to Hurricane Irene. The declaration allows federal aid to supplement local response efforts and authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, specifically FEMA, to coordinate disaster relief efforts. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency, and emergency protective measures will be provided at 75% federal funding. Justo Hern√°ndez has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
