In a teleconference, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about the importance of affordable and accessible high-speed internet in the United States. She drew parallels to the Rural Electrification Administration created by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1935, which brought electricity to rural communities. Harris emphasized that broadband is critical infrastructure, especially in the context of the pandemic, where it is needed for remote learning, telework, telemedicine, and accessing new markets online. She highlighted the barriers of access, affordability, and equity that need to be addressed to ensure every American has access to high-speed internet. Harris discussed the American Jobs Plan, which aims to expand affordable and accessible broadband to every household by building infrastructure, increasing competition, and ensuring affordability. She shared a story of a rural electric cooperative in New Hampshire that laid broadband lines during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the potential for nationwide efforts. Harris expressed her commitment to getting this done and thanked participants for sharing their stories, emphasizing that connecting people is a basic and fundamental need. She stated that this conversation will continue and that action is necessary for the wellbeing of communities, equity, and the country's competitiveness.
