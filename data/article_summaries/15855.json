This article is a background briefing on the General Motors (GM) restructuring that took place in 2009. The briefing was conducted by senior administration officials from the White House. The main points covered in the briefing include the operational restructuring of GM to reduce its break-even point and achieve profitability at a lower level of car sales, the new agreement reached with the United Auto Workers (UAW) involving significant concessions, the agreement with bondholders, the establishment of a new VEBA (employee retirement health care trust), and the provision of additional financing by the US Treasury. The briefing also outlines the government's ownership principles, which include a desire to dispose of equity stakes as soon as possible and to limit government involvement in day-to-day company operations. The briefing concludes by addressing questions about the timeline of the restructuring, the selection of new board members, the impact on GM subsidiaries, and the government's role in executive compensation and management changes.
