In this article, Seema Verma, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, discusses the improvements in the individual health insurance market under the Trump administration. Verma highlights the negative effects of Obamacare, including double-digit premium rate increases and fewer choices for consumers. However, she claims that the Trump administration has taken action to expand affordable coverage options and restore freedom in healthcare financing. Verma states that the individual health insurance market is now offering wider choice and greater stability. She notes that premiums for benchmark plans on the federal exchange are expected to decrease for the first time since Obamacare was enacted. There is also an increase in the number of insurers participating in federal exchanges, providing consumers with more choice between plans. Verma attributes these positive market trends to the actions taken by the Trump administration, such as zeroing out the individual mandate tax penalty and issuing regulations to reduce the ability to wait until needing medical care to enroll in coverage. She also mentions state waivers that provide federal assistance to help states pay for the sickest patients and keep premiums lower. Verma concludes by stating that the administration is committed to increasing choice and competition and lowering costs for consumers.
