President Donald J. Trump recently spoke at the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention and addressed the challenges faced by rural America. He acknowledged that rural employment has grown slower than in urban areas and that poverty rates remain high in many rural communities. Furthermore, he highlighted the lack of broadband access in rural areas, with 39% of rural Americans lacking sufficient internet access. In response, President Trump took action by signing two presidential orders to expand access to broadband internet in rural America. The first order instructs the Department of Interior to allocate assets for rural broadband installation, while the second order streamlines the installation process by requiring standardized forms and contracts for installing antennas on federal buildings. President Trump expressed his commitment to supporting farmers and agricultural leaders and emphasized that the administration will continue to address the barriers to rural prosperity.
