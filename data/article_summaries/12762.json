Vice President Joe Biden had a call with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski to discuss bilateral relations, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and European energy security. They agreed that U.S.-Polish relations were excellent and committed to close consultations regarding threats to European security, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Both leaders emphasized the need for Russia and Russia-backed separatists to fulfill their obligations under the Minsk agreements, including allowing unfettered access for OSCE monitors, withdrawing heavy weapons, and returning control of the international border to Ukraine by the end of the year. They also agreed that any further escalation by Russia would result in increased costs. Additionally, they recognized the importance of infrastructure projects that would contribute to a single, integrated energy market in Europe.
