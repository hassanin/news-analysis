President Donald Trump has issued a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan, which was declared in Executive Order 13067 in 1997, is to continue beyond November 3, 2017. Despite recent positive developments, the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Trump has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
