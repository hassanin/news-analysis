The White House has announced that the 2015 White House Easter Egg Roll will be held on April 6. The event is open to children ages 13 and younger and their families. Tickets for the event can be obtained through a lottery system, which is open from February 23 to February 26. This year's Easter Egg Roll theme is "#GimmeFive," in celebration of the fifth anniversary of the First Lady's Let's Move! initiative. Participants are encouraged to share five things they are doing to lead a healthier life on social media with the hashtag #GimmeFive. The event will include sports and fitness zones, cooking demonstrations, egg roll and egg hunt activities, live music, and storytelling. There are also five souvenir eggs available for purchase, including one that features the stamped "signatures" and "paw prints" of Bo and Sunny, the Obama family's dogs. Additionally, the White House is hosting an Easter Egg Roll Design Contest for elementary and middle school students to submit original artwork related to the theme. The deadline for submissions is March 6. For more information on the event and how to participate, visit obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/eastereggroll.
