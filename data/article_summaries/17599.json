The White House has released a fact sheet outlining the US policy on pre- and post-strike measures to address civilian casualties in US operations involving the use of force. The fact sheet emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in counterterrorism operations, as well as the development of a sustainable legal and policy framework. The measures outlined in the fact sheet include conducting training to reduce civilian casualties, maintaining engagement with organizations that can assist in distinguishing between military targets and civilians, offering condolences and ex gratia payments to civilians affected by operations, and taking steps to minimize future civilian casualties. The fact sheet also highlights the importance of credible reporting in assessing civilian casualties and directs the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release an annual summary of strike data. The fact sheet emphasizes that the US takes great care to adhere to the law of armed conflict and goes to great lengths to minimize the risk of civilian casualties, even in non-permissive environments. The release of aggregate data on strikes is aimed at providing information to the public and demonstrating the legitimacy of US counterterrorism efforts. It acknowledges that non-combatant deaths have occurred, but emphasizes the rigorous standards and procedures applied to strikes. The US government remains committed to refining and strengthening its use of force to protect the nation from terrorist threats.
