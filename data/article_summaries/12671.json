The United States strongly supports the efforts of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) mediators to resolve the conflict in South Sudan peacefully through talks being held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. They call upon rebel-leader Riek Machar and President Salva Kiir to sign the cessation of hostilities agreement tabled by IGAD. The United States is disappointed that the detainees being held by the Government of South Sudan have not been released yet and reiterates its call for their immediate release. Both President Kiir and Mr. Machar are urged to ensure that the lives of their people and the future of their country are not further affected by violence and atrocities.
