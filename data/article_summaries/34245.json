On March 19, 2018, President Donald Trump transmitted a social security totalization agreement with Uruguay to Congress. The agreement, titled "Agreement on Social Security between the United States of America and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay," aims to provide coordination between the social security systems of both countries to eliminate dual coverage and taxation. The agreement also aims to prevent the loss of benefits that can occur when workers divide their careers between two countries. The agreement was signed in January 2017 in Montevideo, Uruguay. A report on the estimated number of individuals who will be affected by the agreement and its estimated cost effect was also included. The Department of State and the Social Security Administration recommended the agreement. President Trump commended the agreement to Congress.
