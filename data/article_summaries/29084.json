President Trump made remarks aboard Air Force One regarding his consideration of commuting the sentence of Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat and former governor of Illinois who appeared on "The Apprentice." Blagojevich was given an 18-year prison sentence for corruption charges, and Trump believes he was treated unfairly. The president mentioned that Blagojevich has been in jail for seven years over a phone call where nothing happened. Trump expressed sympathy for Blagojevich's family and mentioned that he is impressed with his wife. He stated that he is strongly considering commuting Blagojevich's sentence so that he can go home to his family. Trump also criticized the justice system for giving drug dealers shorter sentences for more severe crimes.
