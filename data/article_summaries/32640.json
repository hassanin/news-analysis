President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in response to certain terrorist attacks on September 14, 2001, will continue to be in effect beyond September 14, 2019. Trump argues that the threat of terrorism still persists and that the authorities invoked under the declaration are crucial for the US Armed Forces to carry out essential missions both domestically and internationally. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency status.
