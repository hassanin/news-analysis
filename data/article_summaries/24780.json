Vice President Joe Biden announced that five companies that received funding from the Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) have attracted over $100 million in outside private capital investment. These companies are working on developing new technologies in the clean energy sector. The announcement was made at the National Clean Energy Summit 4.0 in Las Vegas. The companies are focused on advanced grid scale batteries, innovative approaches to biofuels, waste heat recovery, and semiconductor devices for reducing energy consumption. ARPA-E will be making more awards in September, including projects to reduce the need for rare earth materials from China.
