The Biden-Harris Administration plans to improve federal procurement by signing an Executive Order aimed at making federal construction projects more economical and efficient. The order will require the use of project labor agreements on federal construction projects above $35 million, which will help with management and coordination challenges that often delay progress on major construction projects. This will ensure that projects are completed on time and provide the best value for taxpayers' money. The order could affect approximately $262 billion in federal government construction contracting and improve job quality for around 200,000 workers. The departments of Defense and Labor, along with the Office of Management and Budget, will lead a training strategy for the contracting workforce on the implementation of this policy. This Executive Order is part of the administration's efforts to improve the efficiency of federal procurement, which also includes strengthening Buy American rules and implementing a $15/hour minimum wage for federal contractors. The order will only apply to direct federal procurement provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and will benefit taxpayers, contractors, and workers.
