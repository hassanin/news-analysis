President Obama met with members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) to discuss important issues facing the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. They discussed the need for immigration reform, with the President urging the House to take action to pass commonsense immigration reform that would secure borders, crack down on illegal employment, offer a path to citizenship for undocumented individuals, and modernize the legal immigration system. The President thanked CAPAC for their ongoing efforts on this issue and stressed the economic benefits of immigration reform. They also discussed efforts to make the Executive Branch and federal judiciary more diverse and thanked the President for doubling the number of AAPI federal judges. CAPAC thanked the President for his work on the Affordable Care Act and discussed efforts to implement the law, including increased funding for community health centers. The President and CAPAC pledged to work together to ensure that all qualified individuals can sign up for the Health Insurance Marketplace.
