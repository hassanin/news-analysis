President Donald Trump has appointed Robert C. O'Brien as the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs (SPEHA) to focus on bringing back Americans held hostage abroad. O'Brien has a background in law and security, and has served in various public service roles, including as Co-Chairman of the Department of State Public-Private Partnership of Justice Reform in Afghanistan. He will work closely with the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell (HRFC) and the White House-chaired Hostage Response Group to coordinate diplomatic efforts and ensure the safe return of hostages. O'Brien will also maintain a collaborative dialogue with the families of current hostages.
