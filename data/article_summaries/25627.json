The President of the United States, Donald Trump, has issued an Executive Order to declare a national emergency with respect to the situation in Venezuela. This decision is based on several factors including the erosion of human rights guarantees, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, violence and human rights violations in response to antigovernment protests, arbitrary arrest and detention of protestors, government corruption, and the establishment of an illegitimate Constituent Assembly. Additional Executive Orders have been issued in the past to address serious human rights abuses, the humanitarian crisis, corruption, repression, and violence in Venezuela. The circumstances described in these Executive Orders have not improved and continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692 will continue for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
