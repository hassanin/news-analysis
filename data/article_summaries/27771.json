The First Lady, Melania Trump, has announced the construction of a new tennis pavilion on the White House grounds. The pavilion is being funded by private donations and is intended to provide a recreational area for all First Families. The project will utilize the historic Children's Garden and create a private gathering place for First Families to relax. The design of the pavilion will draw inspiration from both the East and West wings of the Executive Mansion, and it aims to complement the architecture of the White House. Melania Trump hopes that the pavilion will serve as a place for First Families to gather and spend leisure time.
