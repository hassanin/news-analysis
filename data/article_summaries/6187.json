President Biden has signed an Executive Order (E.O.) to establish a comprehensive federal digital assets strategy for the United States. The goal is to position the U.S. as a leader in the innovation and governance of the digital assets ecosystem while protecting consumers and promoting economic competitiveness. The E.O. aims to encourage responsible innovation in the digital assets space, with a focus on protecting consumers, investors, businesses, financial stability, and the environment. The order also prioritizes the development of policies for cryptocurrencies and future U.S. central bank digital currency. Collaboration with stakeholders from government, industry, advocacy, academia, and international allies has been instrumental in shaping the E.O. The implementation of the strategy will involve various stakeholders and regulatory agencies to ensure the safety, inclusivity, and adherence to democratic values in the digital asset ecosystem.
