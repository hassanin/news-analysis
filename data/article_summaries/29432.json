Seventy-five years ago, the United States conducted the first nuclear explosive test, code-named "Trinity," marking the beginning of the nuclear age. This event, part of the Manhattan Project, helped end World War II and ushered in a period of global stability, scientific advancement, and economic prosperity. Since then, the US has relied on its nuclear testing and scientific expertise to maintain its stockpile and prevent nuclear threats. Although the US has observed a moratorium on testing since 1992, concerns have been raised about Russia and China conducting nuclear weapons experiments. The US nuclear deterrent is crucial for national security and the defense of allies, as it constrains nuclear proliferation, deters adversaries, and reassures partners. To preserve a credible deterrent, the administration is revitalizing and modernizing America's nuclear security complex, including investing in plutonium pit production and improving infrastructure. The administration also aims to move beyond Cold War-era bilateral treaties and pursue arms control measures that enhance American security, are verifiable and enforceable, and involve responsible partners. On the 75th anniversary of the Trinity test, the US reflects on its tradition of ingenuity and innovation, acknowledging the contributions of the current nuclear enterprise to national security and deterrent capabilities.
