The United States has been a partner of Haiti and has provided support for its safety, security, and development. In January 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration announced $75.5 million in bilateral development and health assistance for various issues such as democratic governance, health, education, agricultural development, and pre-election activities. The United States is also working with the Government of Haiti to deliver 500,000 doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, which will be the first major international delivery of COVID doses to Haiti, with plans to provide more doses in the future. Since the 2010 earthquake, the United States has provided over $5.1 billion in assistance to Haiti for post-disaster relief, recovery, reconstruction, and development programs. The United States is committed to helping the Haitian people in areas such as investigation assistance, security assistance, elections assistance, health and humanitarian assistance, and Temporary Protected Status (TPS).
