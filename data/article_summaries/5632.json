The United States congratulates President Bernardo Arévalo and Vice President Karin Herrera of Guatemala on their inauguration and commends the people of Guatemala for their participation in this important transition. The US will continue to support democratic values and looks forward to hosting President Arévalo in Washington to strengthen the bilateral relationship and address the root causes of migration. The US Administration will collaborate with Guatemala on various issues including civilian security, good governance, human rights, labor protections, gender-based violence, and economic opportunity. The governments must work together to manage irregular migration in the region, and the US is committed to the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. Additionally, the US aims to expand private sector investments in Guatemala through the Central America Forward initiative, which has already generated over $4.2 billion in investments in northern Central America. The US believes that, with the collaboration of the private sector and civil society, a more inclusive, stable, and prosperous future can be built for the people of Guatemala. These efforts may take time, but progress can be achieved together.
