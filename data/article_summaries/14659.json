This article is a presidential memorandum from May 10, 2013, issued by President Barack Obama. The memorandum addresses the issue of pay equality in the federal government and the need to learn from successful practices. It highlights that almost 50 years ago, women were paid 59 cents for every dollar paid to men, and today, women are paid 77 cents for every dollar. The memorandum emphasizes that unjust pay disparities are detrimental to women, families, and the economy. It states that the federal government, as the largest employer in the nation, has a special responsibility to act as a model employer. The memorandum directs the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to develop a government-wide strategy within 180 days to address the gender pay gap in the federal workforce. This strategy should include an analysis of the General Schedule classification system, proposed guidance to promote transparency in starting salaries, and recommendations for further actions or studies. Additionally, each agency is required to provide information and analysis to the OPM regarding their pay and promotion policies and practices within 90 days. The memorandum concludes with general provisions stating that it does not impair existing authorities or create new rights or benefits enforceable by any party.
