This article is a message from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate regarding the annual renewal of the national emergency with respect to Burma. The President states that Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act requires the President to publish a notice in the Federal Register and transmit it to Congress if a national emergency is to continue beyond its anniversary date. The President declares that the national emergency with respect to Burma, declared on May 20, 1997, will continue beyond May 20, 2011. The crisis between the United States and Burma, caused by the actions and policies of the Burmese government, including repression of the democratic opposition, has not been resolved. These actions and policies are considered a threat to U.S. interests and national security. Therefore, the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency and the sanctions against Burma in response to this threat.
