In a statement, President Obama praised Representative Henry Waxman for his 40 years of service in Congress. Waxman's grandparents came to America seeking a better life, and Waxman has fought to provide that opportunity for all Americans. He has been a leader in environmental and healthcare issues, advocating for cleaner air and water, safer food and products, and affordable healthcare. The President called Waxman an extraordinary public servant and one of the most accomplished legislators of his time. He wished Waxman and his family the best as they enter the next chapter of their lives.
