The Biden-Harris administration is launching a new initiative called ALL INside to address unsheltered homelessness in the United States. This initiative is part of the Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness, which aims to reduce homelessness by 25% by 2025. The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness and its 19 federal member agencies will partner with state and local governments in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Phoenix Metro, Seattle, and the State of California to get unsheltered individuals into homes. The administration will provide support to these communities for up to two years, including funding and resources. Additionally, efforts will be made to address barriers to housing, healthcare, and support services for people experiencing homelessness. The American Rescue Plan, passed earlier this year, has already provided significant funding to prevent homelessness, including emergency housing vouchers and rental assistance. The President's Fiscal Year '24 Budget proposes further investments to address and prevent homelessness.
