In this presidential memorandum, President Donald Trump declares that there is enough supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran, allowing for a significant reduction in purchases from Iran through foreign financial institutions. The decision is based on reports from the Energy Information Administration and various factors such as global economic conditions, increased oil production by certain countries, spare petroleum production capacity, and the availability of strategic reserves. The Secretary of State is directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register, and the situation will be closely monitored.
