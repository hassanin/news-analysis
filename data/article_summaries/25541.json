President Trump announced that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will be awarding $1.8 billion in new grant money to combat the opioid epidemic. The funds will be distributed to all 50 states through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The grants will be used to increase access to medication and medication-assisted treatment, as well as mental health resources. The President highlighted the progress that has been made in addressing the opioid crisis, including a decrease in overdose deaths in certain states. He also discussed the administration's efforts to address other healthcare challenges such as kidney disease, HIV, and high drug prices.
