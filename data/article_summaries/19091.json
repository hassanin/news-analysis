The article discusses an executive order issued by President Barack Obama to establish paid sick leave for federal contractors. The order aims to improve efficiency and cost savings in government procurement by ensuring that employees on federal contracts can earn up to 7 days or more of paid sick leave annually. This includes leave for family care. The order also requires that contractors cannot set a limit on the total accrual of paid sick leave per year at less than 56 hours. Paid sick leave can be used for various reasons, including physical or mental illness, obtaining medical care, and caring for a family member. The order also specifies that paid sick leave must be provided upon request and cannot be contingent on finding a replacement worker. The Secretary of Labor is tasked with issuing regulations to implement the order, and agencies are required to take steps to ensure that new contracts comply with the requirements. The order also prohibits interference or discrimination against employees who take paid sick leave and allows for enforcement and investigation of violations. The order does not supersede any existing federal or state laws or collective bargaining agreements that provide greater paid sick leave rights. The order is effective immediately and applies to new contracts awarded on or after January 1, 2017.
