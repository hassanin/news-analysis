The White House has issued a Presidential Memorandum, signed by President Barack Obama, regarding the continuation of U.S. drug interdiction assistance to the government of Colombia. The memorandum states that the interdiction of aircraft involved in illicit drug trafficking in Colombia's airspace is necessary due to the significant threat posed by drug trafficking to the country's national security. It also certifies that Colombia has appropriate procedures in place to minimize the risk of innocent loss of life during these interdictions. The Secretary of State is directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register and inform Congress.
