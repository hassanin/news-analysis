The White House announced that the United States will maintain its current troop levels in Afghanistan, with 9,800 troops remaining through most of 2016. Instead of reducing to an embassy-only presence by the end of 2016, the U.S. will maintain 5,500 troops in Kabul, Bagram, Jalalabad, and Kandahar. The main mission for these troops will be counterterrorism and training, advising, and assisting the Afghan security forces. The decision to maintain troop levels was based on the national security interests of the United States and the request from the Afghan government for continued assistance. The President emphasized that progress has been made in Afghanistan and that the next President will inherit a more stable situation. The U.S. will continue to work on combating corruption in the Afghan government and supporting the reconciliation process. The President also acknowledged the need to prevent civilian casualties in counterterrorism operations.
