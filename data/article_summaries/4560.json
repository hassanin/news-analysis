President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will convene a meeting of the Cancer Cabinet to announce new actions federal agencies are taking to advance the mission of the White House Cancer Moonshot. The goals of the Cancer Moonshot are to reduce the cancer death rate in the United States by at least half by 2047 and improve the experience of people affected by cancer. The Cancer Moonshot has announced around 50 new programs, policies, and resources and secured over 100 commitments from private companies, non-profit organizations, and patient groups. The fight against cancer is a core component of President Biden's Unity Agenda. Today's actions will focus on driving innovation, supporting families affected by cancer, and preventing cancer by addressing smoking. The Cancer Moonshot is also announcing new commitments from non-governmental organizations.
