President Trump visited Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, Kentucky and expressed his optimism about the bipartisan efforts in the state. He acknowledged the division that has existed for a long time but believes that change is coming. When asked about his low poll numbers, he stated that his message is reaching out to people but it takes time for it to resonate. The President also mentioned that he spoke to Leader McConnell and that he is always invited to join him on his trips. However, he doesn't think McConnell needs to join as he has the Senate to run. President Trump's message to the flood victims was that they will stay until their homes are fixed.
