During a teleconference, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Walensky provided an update on the Omicron variant of COVID-19 and the preparations being made in the United States. The Omicron variant was first reported in Botswana and South Africa and has a large number of mutations, some of which are expected to impact transmissibility and antibody binding. As of the time of the briefing, there were 226 confirmed cases in 20 countries, but it had not yet been detected in the United States. The variant has been associated with increased transmissibility and immune evasion. However, it is still too early to determine the severity of the disease caused by the variant. 

The CDC is implementing a surveillance program to monitor the variant and is working closely with the South African government to share information. In vitro neutralization data with vaccines, convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral therapies will be available in two to four weeks to determine the effectiveness of existing treatments against the variant. The CDC has increased its genomic sequencing capacity and is actively looking for the Omicron variant in the United States. The current vaccines are expected to provide some degree of protection against the variant, especially with booster shots. It is important for people to continue following mitigation measures such as wearing masks, avoiding crowds, and getting tested and isolated when appropriate. 

The United States is also actively working to provide vaccines to the rest of the world, with over 275 million doses already sent to 110 countries. The State Department and USAID are leading efforts to turn vaccines into vaccinations by training health workers, running media campaigns, and launching mobile vaccination clinics in other countries. The United States will continue to provide support and assistance to ensure global vaccination efforts.
