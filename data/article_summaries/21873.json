In this presidential memorandum, President Barack Obama authorizes the drawdown of up to $10 million in defense services from the Department of Defense to support France's counterterrorism efforts in Mali, Niger, and Chad. The President determines that an unforeseen emergency exists that requires immediate military assistance, and that these requirements cannot be met under any other provision of law. The Secretary of State is responsible for reporting this determination to Congress, arranging for its publication, and coordinating the implementation of the drawdown.
