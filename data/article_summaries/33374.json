President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared in 1995, will continue beyond March 15, 2019. The President believes that the actions and policies of the Iranian government continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, he has determined that it is necessary to maintain comprehensive sanctions against Iran to address this threat.
