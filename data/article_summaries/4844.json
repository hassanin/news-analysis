President Biden will host the leaders of the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) for a special summit in Washington D.C. and the White House. The summit aims to reaffirm the United States' commitment to Southeast Asia and highlight the importance of cooperation between the U.S. and ASEAN in areas such as security, prosperity, and human rights. Over the years, the U.S. has deepened its partnership with Southeast Asia, providing over $12.1 billion in development, economic, health, and security assistance since 2002. The Biden-Harris Administration's FY 2023 Budget Request includes over $800 million in bilateral assistance for ASEAN partners. The U.S. and Southeast Asia also have strong commercial and trade ties, with ASEAN representing the world's fourth largest market and the U.S. being ASEAN's largest source of foreign direct investment. The U.S.-ASEAN relationship is further strengthened through people-to-people ties, including programs at American Spaces in ASEAN countries, the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, and U.S. visas granted to Southeast Asian travelers. At the U.S.-ASEAN Summit in October 2021, President Biden announced an investment of up to $102 million in U.S.-ASEAN relations, focusing on health, climate, science and innovation, trade facilitation, and education. President Biden is now announcing over $150 million in initiatives to deepen U.S.-ASEAN relations, strengthen ASEAN centrality, and achieve shared objectives. These initiatives include accelerating climate action and sustainable development, supporting access to education, expanding maritime cooperation, and promoting global health and health security. The United States has been actively supporting ASEAN's efforts in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic by providing assistance and donating COVID-19 vaccines to Southeast Asia.
