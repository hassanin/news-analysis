President Donald J. Trump has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in Burundi will continue beyond November 22, 2018. The situation in Burundi, characterized by violence against civilians, unrest, incitement of violence, political repression, and threats to peace, security, and stability in the region, still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13712.
