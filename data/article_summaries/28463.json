On National Maritime Day, President Donald Trump recognizes the vital role played by the United States Merchant Marine in national security and economic growth. The Merchant Marine, known as the "Fourth Arm of Defense," has served with bravery in every American conflict. During World War II, they faced danger at sea and fought enemies to supply the Armed Forces abroad with essential resources. Many mariners lost their lives during this time. Today, American mariners continue to facilitate the shipment of goods along trade routes, projecting a peaceful presence and supporting troops overseas. They also contribute to humanitarian missions, as seen in their efforts to provide aid to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after hurricanes. National Maritime Day is commemorated annually on May 22, in honor of the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship in 1819. President Trump calls upon the people of the United States to observe this day by displaying the American flag and requests that ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
