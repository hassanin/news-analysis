President Trump has issued an executive order to enhance opportunities for military spouses looking for employment in the Federal Government. Military spouses often face challenges in building families at home due to frequent relocations and job searches hindered by state regulations that prevent easy transfer of occupational licenses. The executive order aims to address these issues and provide support for military families.
