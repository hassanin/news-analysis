April is recognized as the Month of the Military Child, a time when the United States pays tribute to the strength and resilience of military children. These children, numbering over 2 million, come from active duty, National Guard, Reserve, and veteran families. They often experience long separations from their parents and face the challenges of changing schools frequently. Despite these difficulties, they continue to support their brave parents. The First Lady and President Biden acknowledge the sacrifices made by military children and express gratitude for their service. The President emphasizes the importance of supporting military families and pledges to fulfill the nation's obligation to properly equip and care for service members and their families. The First Lady has also committed to relaunching the Joining Forces initiative to mobilize Americans in supporting military families. The Month of the Military Child is an opportunity to demonstrate appreciation for the sacrifices made by these children and to honor them with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
