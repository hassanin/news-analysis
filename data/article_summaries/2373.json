The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), and other agencies are working together to protect communities from wildfires. Vice President Harris, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, and White House Senior Advisor Mitch Landrieu announced $197 million in funding to make communities more resilient to wildfires. The funding comes from the USDA's Community Wildfire Defense Grant program, which is part of the President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Over 100 at-risk communities in 22 states and seven Tribes will receive funding to develop and implement plans to protect themselves from wildfires. Activities funded include developing or updating wildfire protection plans, removing vegetation around homes, marking evacuation routes, identifying invasive species, and clearing brush. The Biden-Harris Administration is targeting communities at the greatest risk and prioritizing underserved areas. The DOI also released $50 million in funding for wildfire management and hazardous fuels treatments, which will help limit the severity of wildfires in at-risk areas. These investments build on previous funding allocated by the DOI and USDA. The Biden-Harris Administration is focused on limiting the damage wildfires have on communities and has called on Congress to provide additional funding for wildfire resilience and response in the President's 2024 budget request.
