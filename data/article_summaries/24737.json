Vice President Biden released a statement expressing his sadness over the passing of Jack Brooks. He described Brooks as a tough and bold Texan who lived by his principles and fought for what he believed in. Brooks was one of the few southerners in the 1960s to support civil rights, and throughout his career, he was committed to serving the people who elected him. Biden also mentioned that he had the privilege of working with Brooks when they both chaired judiciary committees in Congress. He ended the statement by sending his thoughts and prayers to Brooks' family.
