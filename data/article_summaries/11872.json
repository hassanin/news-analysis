The article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2012. The order aims to accelerate the deployment of broadband infrastructure in underserved communities, particularly on federal lands, buildings, and rights of way, federally assisted highways, and tribal lands. It establishes a working group to coordinate and implement agency procedures related to broadband access on federal property. The order also requires agencies to develop strategies for facilitating broadband deployment, provide information on accessing federal lands for broadband facilities, and develop templates for uniform contract terms. Additionally, it encourages the installation of underground fiber conduit along highways and roadways to improve traffic flow and reduce future broadband deployment costs. The order emphasizes the importance of broadband access for job creation, innovation, and public safety.
