President Donald J. Trump and his administration have released a set of principles to modernize the Higher Education Act. These principles aim to provide more Americans with affordable and quality education, improve institutional accountability, and help students and families make informed decisions about their educational options. The goal is to prepare more individuals for the jobs of the future and provide flexible learning opportunities for those returning to the classroom after working. The current student loan debt exceeds credit card debt, auto loans, and home equity loans. The administration is urging members of Congress to support and pass these reforms to ensure Americans thrive in today's economy.
