The United States has announced that it will provide nearly $601 million in additional aid to those affected by the war in Syria. This brings the total humanitarian assistance provided by the US to over $5.1 billion since the start of the crisis. The funding will provide shelter, water, medical care, food, protection, and other necessities to millions of people suffering inside Syria and the 4.6 million refugees from Syria in the region. The US will also provide more than $290 million in development assistance to support education in Jordan and Lebanon for Syrian refugees. The US has been leading the international response to the crisis in Syria, and other countries, such as the EU, Germany, and the UK, have also made significant pledges of aid.
