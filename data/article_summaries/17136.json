President Obama has announced that the Federal Government will reduce greenhouse gas pollution from indirect sources, such as employee travel and commuting, by 13% by 2020. This commitment expands on the Administration's previous target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from direct sources, such as Federal fleets and buildings. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a total of 101 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to the emissions from 235 million barrels of oil. This is in line with President Obama's Executive Order 13514 on Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance, which aims to lead the Federal government towards a clean energy economy. The Federal government is the largest energy consumer in the US economy, owning 600,000 vehicles and nearly 500,000 buildings. The target will engage the approximately 2 million men and women employed by Federal agencies. The government has launched the GreenGov Challenge to gather ideas from Federal employees on how to meet sustainability goals, with some ideas already being put into practice. Progress in meeting these goals will be measured and reported online to the public.
