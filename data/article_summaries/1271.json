President Biden's economic vision focuses on investing in America and growing the economy from the bottom up and middle out, rather than benefiting the wealthy. His budget includes tax cuts of almost $800 billion over the next 10 years for working people and families with children. These tax cuts are funded by ensuring that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share in taxes and cutting spending on special interests. The President's plan does not raise taxes for anyone with an income below $400,000 per year.

On the other hand, Congressional Republicans have proposed top-down tax cuts that would add over $3 trillion to the debt. These tax cuts primarily benefit the wealthy and large corporations. Additionally, they have also proposed tax increases for millions of middle-class and working Americans. Republicans are also pushing for significant cuts to programs that middle-class and working families, seniors, and students rely on, without providing a budget that outlines how these cuts will be paid for.

Under President Biden's plan, tax cuts would benefit families with children, working households, people buying health insurance, and families adopting a child. On the other hand, under Congressional Republican proposals, huge corporations, multi-millionaires, and wealthy tax cheats would see tax cuts.

In terms of tax increases, under President Biden's plan, billionaires who currently pay little to no taxes, huge corporations sheltering income in tax havens, and businesses engaging in stock buybacks would pay more. However, under Congressional Republican proposals, it would be middle-class and working families, as well as seniors, who would pay more in taxes.
