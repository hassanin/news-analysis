Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk to congratulate him on forming a new government and to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine. They discussed Russia's failure to fulfill its commitments under the Minsk agreements, such as withdrawing troops and heavy weapons, returning Ukrainian hostages, and allowing for an OSCE monitoring mission. They also discussed the armed robberies by Russian proxies in the east and the "war tax" imposed on pensioners and citizens. The Vice President condemned this behavior and supported Yatsenyuk's plan to hold pension and social benefit payments in escrow until it is safe to deliver them. Both leaders called on Russia to create safe conditions for delivering humanitarian aid and recommencing social benefits payments to residents of separatist-controlled territories, as agreed in the Minsk agreement.
