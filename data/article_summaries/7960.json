The article discusses the launch of an initiative called Partners in the Blue Pacific (PBP), which aims to support Pacific Island priorities more effectively and efficiently. The initiative involves Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, who are committed to closer cooperation in addressing urgent challenges in the Pacific region. The PBP will be led and guided by the Pacific Islands, with a focus on areas such as climate crisis, connectivity, maritime security, health, prosperity, and education. The governments will continue to engage with Pacific governments and regional institutions, and a progress review is planned for later this year.
