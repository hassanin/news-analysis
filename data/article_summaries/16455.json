On July 30, 2009, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies regarding guidelines for human stem cell research. The memorandum stated that the administration is committed to supporting and conducting ethically responsible and scientifically worthy human stem cell research, including human embryonic stem cell research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) had previously published the "National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Human Stem Cell Research" in accordance with an executive order issued on March 9, 2009. These guidelines apply to the use of NIH funds for research involving human embryonic stem cells and certain uses of human induced pluripotent stem cells. The guidelines are based on the principles that responsible research with human embryonic stem cells can improve our understanding of human biology and aid in the discovery of new ways to prevent and treat illness. Individuals donating embryos for research purposes should do so voluntarily and with informed consent. The memorandum directed the heads of executive departments and agencies that support and conduct stem cell research to adopt these guidelines to ensure consistent implementation of the executive order. The memorandum also required departments and agencies to submit proposed additions or revisions to any other guidance, policies, or procedures related to human stem cell research within 90 days. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in coordination with the Director of NIH, would review these proposals. The memorandum clarified that it does not create any enforceable right or benefit against the United States or any other party. Executive departments and agencies are expected to carry out the provisions of the memorandum within the limits of the law and their statutory and regulatory authorities. The Director of the OMB was authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
