President Biden has transmitted an alternative plan for pay adjustments for civilian Federal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay systems in January 2023. He has determined that the across-the-board base pay increase will be 4.1 percent and locality pay increases will average 0.5 percent, resulting in an overall average increase of 4.6 percent for civilian Federal employees. This decision aims to address recruitment and retention challenges faced by federal agencies and to keep federal pay competitive with the private sector. The adjustment will take effect on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
