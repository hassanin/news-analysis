The article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama to modify the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) and make technical and conforming changes to existing provisions. The modifications are made to conform to amendments made to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. The proclamation also ensures the continuation of duty reductions for goods imported under various trade agreements, such as the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement, United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement, Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement, United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement, United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, and United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement. Additionally, the proclamation makes technical corrections to provide the intended tariff treatment for goods covered by the World Trade Organization Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products and to implement Executive Order 13742, which revoked the ban on the importation of jadeite or rubies from Burma. The modifications and technical rectifications to the HTS will take effect on January 1, 2017, or 30 days after the date of publication of the proclamation in the Federal Register.
