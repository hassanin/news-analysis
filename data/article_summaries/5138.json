Delta Air Lines will transport more than 3.2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Kendamil infant formula from London to Boston and Detroit free of charge. This is part of the sixth Operation Fly Formula flight, initiated by President Biden to speed up the importation of safe infant formula. The formula will be distributed and available for purchase at select U.S. retailers and online. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed Kendamil to import infant formula under their brand. The Biden Administration has also taken other measures to ensure an adequate supply of safe infant formula, including invoking the Defense Production Act and issuing FDA guidance for the importation of formula not currently produced for the U.S. market.
