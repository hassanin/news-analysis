This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to Côte d'Ivoire. The national emergency was initially declared in 2006 due to the threat it posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The situation in Côte d'Ivoire has involved the massacre of civilians, human rights abuses, political violence, and attacks against peacekeeping forces. The notice acknowledges the progress made by the Government of Côte d'Ivoire in promoting democracy, social, and economic development. The United States supports impartial justice and the government's efforts to prepare for a peaceful and fair presidential election in 2015. Despite the progress, the situation still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States' national security and foreign policy, hence the need for the continuation of the national emergency. The notice concludes by stating that the emergency will continue for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
