In terms of education, the Administration is working to improve the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) by releasing a blueprint for a 21st Century education for BIE, transforming BIE into a School Improvement Organization, providing high-speed internet connectivity to BIE schools, and giving BIE schools greater flexibility and support for school improvements. The Administration is also committed to supporting the academic achievement of all Native American students by implementing rigorous college- and career-ready standards and providing support and resources. In terms of economic development, the Administration is removing regulatory barriers to infrastructure and energy development on Indian land, helping tribes implement the Helping Expedite & Advance Responsible Tribal Homeownership Act, making federal data and resources for tribal economic development more accessible, encouraging the use of tax-exempt bonds for tribal economic development, and supporting the growth of new markets for Native American small businesses.
