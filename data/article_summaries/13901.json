Vice President Biden has launched an initiative to bring broadband access and jobs to more Americans. He announced the availability of $4 billion in loans and grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to help expand broadband service in un-served and underserved communities across the country. This funding aims to bridge the technological divide and create jobs in building out internet infrastructure. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service (RUS) will be using the funding to deploy broadband infrastructure in these areas. The Commerce Department's Broadband Technology Opportunities Program will also play a role in reaching underserved communities. Applications for loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations will be accepted from July 14 to August 14, 2009. Public workshops will be held in various locations to provide information about the funding opportunities and application process. The initiative is part of the broader American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which aims to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and address various challenges facing the country.
