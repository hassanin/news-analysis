In this statement, President Barack Obama expresses the United States' support for core principles such as opposition to violence, protection of human rights, and reform that meets the aspirations of the Egyptian people. The US does not support specific individuals or political parties but is committed to the democratic process and the rule of law. The US is concerned about the decision of the Egyptian Armed Forces to remove President Morsy and suspend the constitution, and urges the military to quickly and responsibly return authority to a democratically elected civilian government through an inclusive and transparent process. The US will review the implications of these developments on its assistance to Egypt. The US believes that lasting stability in Egypt can be achieved through a democratic political order with participation from all sides and all political parties. The military is expected to protect the rights of all Egyptians, including the right to peaceful assembly and fair trials. The voices of all peaceful protesters, including those who supported President Morsy, must be heard. The US urges all sides to avoid violence and work together to restore Egypt's democracy. The US will continue to work with the Egyptian people to ensure a successful transition to democracy.
