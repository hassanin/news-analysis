President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Promoting Research and Observations of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting of Tomorrow Act" or the "PROSWIFT Act." The Act aims to enhance the collection of space weather data and improve space weather forecasting. However, Trump notes that certain provisions of the Act could potentially limit his authority to conduct foreign affairs as granted by Article II of the Constitution. While the limitations will be treated as advisory and non-binding, he emphasizes the importance of addressing the resilience of national security assets and critical infrastructure to space weather, as they can be adversely affected. Trump expresses his willingness to collaborate with Congress to improve the resilience of these assets.
