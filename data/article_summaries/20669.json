In this speech, Vice President Joe Biden discusses the potential nuclear deal with Iran and addresses concerns surrounding it. He emphasizes the threat that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose, particularly to Israel, and explains that the United States is committed to preventing this from happening. Biden highlights the efforts made by the Obama administration to address the Iran nuclear issue, including the imposition of tough sanctions and the negotiation of an interim deal. He also outlines the key requirements for a final deal, such as blocking Iran's paths to a nuclear bomb, ensuring a breakout timeline of at least one year, and providing verifiable assurances of Iran's peaceful intentions. Biden refutes criticisms that the deal would be weak or enable Iran to gain dominance in the Middle East, arguing that it would actually make the region and the world safer. He assures that the U.S. will continue to support and protect Israel, and that it is prepared to counter Iran's destabilizing activities. Biden concludes by urging people to make their judgment on the final deal when it is presented, but to also be critical of the criticism surrounding it.
