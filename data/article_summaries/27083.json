During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, this statement calls attention to the struggles faced by men and families affected by prostate cancer. It highlights the common risk factors and treatments for the disease, as well as the hope provided by medical advances. Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in American men, with a lifetime diagnosis rate of nearly 12 percent. Over 200,000 men are newly diagnosed each year, and more than 30,000 die from the disease. African American men, men over 65, and those with family histories of prostate or other cancers are at the greatest risk. While some symptoms may indicate the presence of prostate cancer, many men experience no symptoms. Screening using the prostate specific antigen test is encouraged for men aged 55 to 69 to detect abnormalities and early-stage cancer. The statement emphasizes the importance of early detection, as prostate cancer is treatable. The administration is committed to ensuring access to necessary drugs and therapies, including those for prostate cancer. An Executive Order was signed to eliminate kickbacks to drug company middlemen and improve prescription drug affordability. The statement concludes by affirming support for all those battling prostate cancer and working towards a future free from the disease.
