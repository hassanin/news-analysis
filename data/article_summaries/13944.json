The White House has announced new sanctions on Russia in response to their actions in Ukraine. The sanctions include freezing the assets of seven Russian government officials and four individuals who have contributed to the crisis in Ukraine. The United States is also imposing sanctions on entities operating in the arms sector in Russia and any individuals who provide material support to senior officials of the Russian government. The European Union is also expected to announce its own sanctions. The United States is urging Russia to deescalate the situation and is keeping the door open for diplomatic solutions. However, if Russia continues to escalate the crisis, the United States is prepared to take further action.
