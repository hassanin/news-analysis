President Obama has nominated Judge Robin S. Rosenbaum to serve on the United States Court of Appeals. Judge Rosenbaum has a strong background in law, having served as a United States District Court Judge, an adjunct professor, a United States Magistrate Judge, and an Assistant United States Attorney. She has also worked as a clerk, a litigation associate, and a trial attorney. Judge Rosenbaum received her J.D. from the University of Miami School of Law and her B.A. from Cornell University. President Obama believes that she will be a valuable addition to the 11th Circuit.
