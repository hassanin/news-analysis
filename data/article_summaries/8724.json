Today, Susan Rice, Cedric Richmond, and Jen Klein hosted a roundtable in the Roosevelt Room with LGBTQ+ leaders to discuss the importance of passing the Equality Act. Advocates shared their perspectives on extending civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ Americans and discussed efforts to get the bill to the President's desk. They also briefed White House officials on the increase in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, particularly bills targeting transgender children, and the negative impact on their health and well-being. The White House officials expressed gratitude for the advocates' leadership and reiterated the President's commitment to achieving full equality. Participants in the roundtable included various LGBTQ+ leaders.
