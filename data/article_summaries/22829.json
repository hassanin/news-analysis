During National Reentry Week, the Obama Administration is taking steps to reduce barriers to reentry and employment for formerly incarcerated individuals. The President signed a Presidential Memorandum establishing the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, which will lead the government's work on rehabilitation and reintegration. The Office of Personnel Management is proposing a rule that would prohibit federal agencies from asking about criminal and credit history until a conditional offer of employment has been made, allowing individuals with criminal records to compete for federal jobs. The Presidential Memorandum also directs agencies to review their procedures for conducting suitability determinations for job applicants with criminal records, and agencies with discretion to grant or deny occupational licenses are asked to revise their procedures to ensure that a criminal record is not an automatic disqualifier. The private sector is also being engaged through the Fair Chance Business Pledge, which encourages companies to provide job opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals. Additionally, federal agencies have announced various actions to improve rehabilitation and reintegration during National Reentry Week, including releasing reports, hosting events, providing guidance, and participating in events at Bureau of Prison facilities and VA medical centers.
