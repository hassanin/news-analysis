President Donald J. Trump, Sudanese Chairman of the Sovereignty Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a discussion to talk about Sudan's progress towards democracy and peace in the region. The Sudanese transitional government has shown commitment to combating terrorism, building democratic institutions, and improving relations with neighbors. Following President Trump's decision to remove Sudan from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, the United States and Israel agreed to partner with Sudan and support its integration into the international community. Steps will be taken to restore Sudan's sovereign immunity and reduce its debt burdens. The leaders also agreed to normalize relations between Sudan and Israel, ending the state of belligerence between the two nations. Economic and trade relations, particularly in agriculture, will be established, and negotiations will be held in various areas of cooperation. The agreement is seen as a step towards improving regional security and creating new opportunities for Sudan, Israel, the Middle East, and Africa. The leaders expressed appreciation for President Trump's approach to resolving conflicts and promoting peace in the region.
