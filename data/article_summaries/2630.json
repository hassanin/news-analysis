During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki introduced Brian Deese, the NEC Director, to discuss the current economic situation. Deese highlighted several key points, including the strong economic recovery in 2021, with the largest decline in unemployment, the most jobs created, and the strongest economic growth in nearly 40 years. He also mentioned the recent deceleration in the rate of price increases, particularly in food and energy prices. Deese emphasized that global price increases are a result of the global challenge of recovering from the pandemic. He noted that the United States is well positioned to address these challenges and outlined the President's three-part plan to tackle prices and costs: unsticking supply chains, protecting consumers, and promoting competition. Deese also mentioned the importance of passing the Build Back Better framework to address these issues. During the Q&A portion of the briefing, Deese answered questions about inflation, the global context, the Federal Reserve, food affordability, and China's impact on inflation. Psaki also provided updates on COVID-19 testing availability and the administration's efforts to address climate change.
