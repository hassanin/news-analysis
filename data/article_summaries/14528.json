President Obama is urging Congress to pass the transportation piece of the American Jobs Act, which includes a $50 billion investment in the nation's transportation infrastructure and a $10 billion investment in a National Infrastructure Bank. These initiatives aim to put construction workers back on the job rebuilding roads, rails, and runways. The Key Bridge in Washington, D.C. is in need of repairs, and if Congress passes the bill, these repairs could be made more quickly, potentially starting in 2013. The White House released a report highlighting the importance of investing in transportation infrastructure and promoting private sector growth and job creation. The administration has also taken steps to improve the process of reviewing and approving transportation projects, including awarding TIGER grants, shortening the application process for TIFIA funding, and establishing a Transportation Rapid Response Team to expedite reviews of projects.
