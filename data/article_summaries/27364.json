The article discusses the efforts of President Trump and Vice President Pence to restore the rights and property of Iraq's Christian and Yazidi communities, who were targeted by ISIS.

USAID Administrator Mark Green has been directed to travel to Iraq and provide a comprehensive assessment to address any potential issues that could delay the distribution process.
