The leaders of the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States have jointly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pledged their support to the Ukrainian government and people. They view Russia's actions as a violation of international rules and norms established since World War II. To hold Russia accountable, they have imposed severe measures on Russian institutions and banks, as well as on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moving forward, they will disconnect selected Russian banks from the international financial system, prevent the Russian Central Bank from using its reserves in a way that undermines sanctions, limit the sale of citizenship to wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government, and establish a transatlantic task force to freeze assets of sanctioned individuals and companies. They also plan to increase coordination against disinformation and hybrid warfare. The leaders are committed to taking further measures if necessary to hold Russia accountable for its actions.
