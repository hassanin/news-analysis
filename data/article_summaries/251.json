The article provides an embargoed preview of President Biden's American Families Plan, which will be unveiled the following day. The plan includes investments in education, childcare, nutrition, and tax reform. It aims to provide four years of free education for every student, universal high-quality preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, two years of free community college, and increased assistance for low-income students. The plan also focuses on improving teacher training and support, addressing teacher shortages, and investing in the childcare workforce. It includes provisions for affordable childcare, a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave program, and expanding summer meal programs for children. On the tax side, the plan extends key tax cuts for lower- and middle-income workers and families, and proposes tax reforms to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share. The plan is a 10-year program, with different initiatives phasing in at different times. It is a federal-state partnership, but provisions are in place for states that choose not to participate. The plan aims to be fully paid for through offsets, including tax enforcement measures and tax increases for the top income earners. The timeline for passage is as soon as possible. The plan does not include lowering the Medicare eligibility age or drug pricing legislation, but the President remains committed to negotiating lower drug prices. The childcare benefits will be available on a sliding scale for families up to 150 percent of the state median income, with the amount capped at 7 percent of their income. The plan also includes permanent expansions of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit.
