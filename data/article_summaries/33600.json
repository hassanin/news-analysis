In a statement, the President of the United States expressed the importance of the country's relationship with China but highlighted the unfair trade practices that have been ongoing. Specifically, he mentioned China's acquisition of American intellectual property and technology, which has been harming the US economy and national security. As a result, the US will implement a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of goods from China that contain industrially significant technologies. This move aims to prevent further unfair transfers of American technology and protect American jobs. The statement also indicated that the US will pursue additional tariffs if China retaliates with measures such as imposing tariffs on US goods or taking punitive actions against American exporters or companies operating in China.
