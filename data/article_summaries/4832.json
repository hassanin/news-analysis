On May 15, 2019, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared a national emergency due to the threat posed by the unrestricted acquisition and use of certain information and communications technology and services transactions by foreign adversaries. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The President stated that the acquisition or use of such technology and services by foreign adversaries enhances their ability to exploit vulnerabilities in information and communications technology, which could have catastrophic effects. The national emergency declared in 2019 is set to continue beyond May 15, 2021, for the purpose of securing the information and communications technology and services supply chain. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
