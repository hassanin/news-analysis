Vice President Walter Mondale has passed away, leaving behind a legacy of dedication and service. President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden express their sadness at his passing but also their gratitude for having known him as a dear friend and mentor. Mondale's impact was significant, both as a Senator and as Vice President. He played a key role in passing important laws such as the Fair Housing Act and Title IX, which aimed to prevent racial discrimination in housing and provide more opportunities for women, respectively. President Biden credits Mondale with teaching him the possibilities of his role as a Senator and later as Vice President. Mondale's wife, Joan, also played a significant role in shaping the role of the Second Lady. Walter Mondale made history by selecting a woman, Geraldine Ferraro, as his running mate during his own presidential campaign. President Biden highlights Mondale's commitment to values such as truth, lawfulness, caring for others, and love for country. The Bidens extend their condolences to the Mondale family and find solace in the belief that he is now reunited with his wife and daughter.
