Senator Kent Conrad has announced his support for a proposal to extend expiring tax cuts in order to create jobs, strengthen economic growth, and prevent tax increases for middle-class Americans. He believes that the compromise proposal, which includes a two-year extension of all tax cuts, continuation of long-term unemployment benefits, tax breaks for businesses, and a partial payroll tax holiday for working families, is necessary to boost economic growth. Economists estimate that the package would inject an additional $300 billion into the economy and create over 1.6 million jobs, reducing unemployment to 8.5% by the end of 2011. While Senator Conrad agrees with the overall package, he expresses disappointment with the estate tax provision and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive plan to address America's deficit and debt through fundamental tax reform and spending cuts.
