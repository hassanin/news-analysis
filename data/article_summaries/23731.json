On May 5, 2016, President Barack Obama granted commutation of sentence to 58 individuals. The individuals had been convicted of various drug-related offenses and were serving lengthy prison sentences. The commutations granted by President Obama allowed these individuals to have their sentences shortened and in some cases, they were released from prison. The commutations were part of President Obama's efforts to address what he believed were overly harsh sentences for non-violent drug offenders.
