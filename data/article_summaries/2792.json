Vice President Kamala Harris visited Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to rally support for John Fetterman, who is running for the Senate. She emphasized the importance of the upcoming election and thanked the audience for their support in electing her and President Joe Biden in 2020. Harris highlighted the achievements made possible by voter turnout, such as the extension of the Child Tax Credit and the reduction of child poverty, the tax cut for working families, the funding for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and the efforts to make healthcare more affordable, including capping insulin prices and allowing Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. Harris also emphasized the need for more Democratic senators to pass important legislation, such as the Women's Health Protection Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. She urged the audience to use their power and vote in the upcoming election, emphasizing that the Senate seat is for six years and has long-term implications. Harris concluded by asking for support for both Fetterman and Josh Shapiro, who is running for governor in Pennsylvania.
