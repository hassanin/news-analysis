President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring April 20 to April 28, 2019, as National Park Week in the United States. The proclamation highlights the importance of the National Parks System and encourages Americans to visit and appreciate the natural, cultural, and historical heritage of these parks. It also acknowledges the need for special care and attention to preserve and maintain the parks, as there is currently a backlog of postponed work projects totaling nearly $12 billion. The proclamation emphasizes the commitment of the administration to reduce this backlog and improve the management of public lands through public-private partnerships. The proclamation concludes by urging Americans to take advantage of the accessibility of national parks and experience the beauty and significance of these natural and historic treasures.
