The President released a statement on a new report by the Business Roundtable on health insurance reform. The report highlights the importance of comprehensive health insurance reform for American competitiveness. It suggests that businesses could see a reduction in health care costs by up to $3,000 per employee in 2019 if reform is passed this year. The report also emphasizes the need for cost-containment and fiscal responsibility provisions in the legislation, such as the creation of a CMS Innovation Center, accountable care organizations, and reducing preventable hospital re-admissions. It warns that if comprehensive reform is not passed, health care costs will continue to rise, and in ten years, employment-based spending on health care for large employers will be 166 percent higher per employee than it is today. The report comes at a time when Congress is making progress in reforming the health care system, with the House of Representatives passing their version of the legislation and the Senate's version moving to the floor soon. The President stresses the potential benefits for American businesses and urges against delay or political games in the reform process. He looks forward to working with the business community and Congress to pass reform by the end of the year.
