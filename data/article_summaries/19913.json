The President congratulates Croatia on their Statehood Day and highlights the close relationship between the US and Croatia since their independence in 1991. He mentions the support given to Croatia as they established their democracy and their contribution to regional and global security. The joint membership in NATO makes them allies, but their relationship goes beyond that and makes them friends. The President also acknowledges the pride that Americans with Croatian origins or family should feel for the lasting ties between the two nations.
