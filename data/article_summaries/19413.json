The Vice President and Dr. Jill Biden released a statement expressing their condolences on the passing of Evelyn Lieberman, a dear friend of theirs for thirty years. Lieberman was described as wise, smart, funny, and a gifted storyteller. She served as the Vice President's press secretary in the Senate and went on to tackle important issues such as Supreme Court nominations and violence against women. Lieberman cared deeply about humanity and real people, drawing from her own experiences growing up in Brooklyn as the granddaughter of Russian immigrants. She believed in the American Dream and dedicated her life to giving back and helping others. Lieberman was known for her character and her commitment to serving others. The Biden family and those who worked with Lieberman will miss her greatly and hope that her husband and family find comfort in knowing that she made a positive impact on the lives of many and contributed to a better country.
