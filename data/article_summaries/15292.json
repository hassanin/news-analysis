President Obama announced new actions to strengthen global resilience to climate change and launched partnerships to cut carbon pollution at the United Nations Climate Summit in 2014. The tools for global resilience include improved extreme weather risk outlooks, data, tools, and services to help countries prepare for the impacts of climate change, and a new public-private partnership to ensure that climate data and products are useful to developing countries. The President also announced a new Executive Order requiring Federal agencies to factor climate resilience into their international development programs. The United States also announced its participation in new climate change partnerships, including the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture and the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership. These actions build on the President's Climate Action Plan, which aims to reduce carbon pollution, promote clean energy sources, and protect American communities from the impacts of climate change. The United States is also working internationally to press for an ambitious global climate agreement and to cut financial support for new coal-fired power plants.
