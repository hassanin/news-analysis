In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims April 2013 as National Cancer Control Month. He highlights the progress made in reducing the overall cancer death rate in the United States, but acknowledges that more work needs to be done as over half a million Americans still die from cancer each year. The President emphasizes the importance of prevention, encouraging individuals to maintain a healthy lifestyle, limit alcohol intake and sun exposure, and quit smoking. He also mentions that the Affordable Care Act ensures coverage for recommended cancer screenings and preventive services, as well as access to treatments without denial due to pre-existing conditions or annual limits on benefits. President Obama calls for continued investment in medical research to find breakthroughs in cancer treatment. He urges the nation to honor those who have lost their lives to cancer and support those currently battling the disease. The proclamation is in response to a request from the Congress of the United States, made in 1938, to declare April as "Cancer Control Month."
