President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of New Hampshire and has ordered Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts following a severe storm and flooding that occurred from July 11 to July 12, 2019. Federal funding will be available to State and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the storm and flooding in the county of Grafton. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. James McPherson has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the State and warranted by further damage assessments.
