In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reports on a series of attacks conducted by Houthi militants in Yemen against United States military forces and commercial shipping. These attacks pose a threat to the safety of US forces, commercial ships, regional stability, and navigational rights. In response to these attacks and the threat of future ones, the US, along with the United Kingdom, Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands, conducted discrete strikes against facilities and storage sites in Yemen associated with the Houthi militants. The purpose of these strikes was to protect US personnel and assets, degrade the Houthi militants' ability to carry out future attacks, and prevent further destabilization of the region. The strikes were conducted in a manner designed to limit the risk of escalation and civilian casualties. President Biden asserts that this military action was taken in accordance with his responsibility to protect US citizens and national security interests, as well as in line with international law and the United States' right of self-defense. He also states that further action may be taken if necessary. The report is provided to keep Congress informed, in compliance with the War Powers Resolution. President Biden expresses appreciation for Congress' support in this action.
