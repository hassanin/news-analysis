Jill and I send our best wishes to Buddhists in the United States and globally as they celebrate Vesak, a day dedicated to the Buddha's birth, enlightenment, and passing. The lighting of a lamp symbolizes the holiday, which has been observed for over 2,500 years, and reminds us of Buddhism's values of compassion, humility, and selflessness. We also recognize the contributions of Buddhists in America, who enhance our communities and work towards a better future for all.
