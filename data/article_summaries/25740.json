The President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, has issued a Presidential Memoranda regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to North Korea. This memorandum is in accordance with Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, which states that a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and transmits it to Congress within 90 days of the anniversary date of its declaration. The memorandum states that the national emergency with respect to North Korea, which was declared in Executive Order 13466 on June 26, 2008, expanded in subsequent executive orders, and addressed further in Executive Order 13722 on March 15, 2016, will continue beyond June 26, 2017. The memorandum cites the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, the destabilizing actions and policies of the North Korean government, including its pursuit of nuclear and missile programs, and other provocative and repressive actions as reasons for the continuation of the national emergency.
