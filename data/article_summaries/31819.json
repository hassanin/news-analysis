The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has released a report on the economic costs of the opioid crisis in the United States. The report states that previous estimates of the economic cost greatly underestimated the crisis by not accounting for fatalities resulting from overdoses. The CEA estimates that in 2015, the economic cost of the opioid crisis was $504.0 billion, or 2.8 percent of GDP that year. This is over six times larger than the most recent estimate of the economic cost. The report takes into consideration the value of life, underreporting of opioids in overdose deaths, heroin-related fatalities, and nonfatal costs of opioid misuse.
