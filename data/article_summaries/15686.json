In this proclamation, President Barack Obama declares November 2012 as National Diabetes Month in the United States. The proclamation highlights the impact of diabetes, a chronic and life-threatening illness that affects people of all ages, ethnicities, and backgrounds. It mentions the complications associated with diabetes, such as kidney failure, blindness, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. The proclamation emphasizes the need for greater awareness and research to reduce the impact of diabetes on the country. It states that over 20 million Americans currently suffer from diabetes, with more than 1 million new cases expected to be diagnosed this year. The proclamation distinguishes between Type 1 diabetes, which often develops in childhood and requires insulin injections, and Type 2 diabetes, which is associated with obesity, physical inactivity, family history, and older age. It mentions that certain racial and ethnic groups are at higher risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. The proclamation encourages Americans to learn more about diabetes and take steps to reduce their risk, such as adopting a healthy lifestyle. It also highlights initiatives like the National Diabetes Prevention Program and the Affordable Care Act, which aim to prevent and manage diabetes. The proclamation mentions the importance of early diagnosis and effective management of diabetes, as well as efforts to address childhood obesity through the Let's Move! initiative led by First Lady Michelle Obama. The proclamation concludes by calling upon various groups and organizations to participate in activities that raise awareness about diabetes and contribute to its prevention, treatment, and management.
