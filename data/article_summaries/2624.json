President Biden has declared a major disaster in Maryland due to the effects of Tropical Storm Isaias in August 2020. Federal assistance will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. E. Craig Levy, Sr. has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Additional designations may be made later if requested by the state and further damage assessments warrant it. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
