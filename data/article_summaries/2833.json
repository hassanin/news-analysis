The author of the article emphasizes the urgent need for military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in light of Russian aggression. They state that the resources provided by Congress are nearly exhausted and that aid is critical for Ukraine's success on the battlefield. The author urges Congress to pass the proposed aid package quickly. 

However, the author also acknowledges the importance of funding for COVID treatments, vaccines, and tests. They were initially planning to include this funding in the Ukraine Supplemental bill but were informed that it would delay the urgently needed Ukrainian aid. As a result, they are willing to separate the two measures to ensure prompt delivery of Ukrainian aid. 

The author highlights the significance of timely COVID funding, warning that without it, more Americans will die and the country will lose its place in line for new COVID treatments and vaccines. They mention the potential inability to maintain the supply of COVID tests and the lack of critical treatments if new variants emerge. Additionally, the effort to distribute vaccines to lower-income countries will be affected. 

In conclusion, the author calls on Congress to pass the Ukrainian Supplemental funding bill immediately, followed by prompt action on the COVID funding bill, as both are crucial in saving lives at home and abroad.
