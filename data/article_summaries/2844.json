On October 8, 2021, the President signed into law S. 189, known as the "Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2021." This law ensures that veterans' disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation beneficiaries receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) equal to the Social Security COLA. The law acknowledges the efforts of Senators Thune, Schatz, Blumenthal, Sinema, Hassan, Tester, Hirono, Murray, Brown, and Sanders, as well as Representatives Luria, Nehls, Takano, and Bost for their leadership in getting the bill passed.
