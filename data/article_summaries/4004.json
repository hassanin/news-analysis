The article highlights the strong jobs recovery in the United States, with the average number of Americans filing for unemployment over the last four weeks at its lowest level since 1969. The number of people receiving unemployment benefits has decreased from over 18 million to 2 million. The current administration has added nearly six million jobs this year, the most of any first-year president in history. The American Rescue Plan and successful vaccination program have contributed to this record-setting pace of Americans returning to work. Additionally, families have more money in their pockets, with an average increase of $100 per month compared to last year, accounting for inflation. The article also mentions that while the jobs and economic recovery have been significant, addressing rising prices, supply chain challenges, and COVID-19 remain top priorities. Concrete actions are needed to lower costs for American families, including prescription drug costs, healthcare costs, childcare costs, and housing costs through the Build Back Better plan. Furthermore, efforts to vaccinate and boost as many Americans as possible are crucial.
