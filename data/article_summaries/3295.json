The Biden-Harris Administration has approved the first 15 Tribal State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) awards for tribal governments, providing $73 million to support Tribal enterprises and small business owners. This funding is part of President Biden's Investing in America agenda and comes from the American Rescue Plan. It is aimed at helping Tribal communities and Native-owned small businesses recover from the pandemic, which disproportionately affected them. This is the first time that SSBCI awards have been given directly to Tribal Governments. The announcement coincides with the launch of President Biden's Investing in America tour, where leaders across the Administration will highlight investments in manufacturing, infrastructure, and cost-saving initiatives. The ARP included over $500 million in SSBCI support for Tribal Governments, marking the first-ever inclusion of dedicated support for Tribal Governments in the program. The expansion of SSBCI is expected to support 100,000 small businesses nationwide and result in billions of dollars in new small business financing over the decade. The goal is to ensure that all Americans, including those in historically underserved Tribal communities, benefit from small business growth. The SSBCI awards will not only benefit Tribal communities and Native entrepreneurs but also create jobs and economic opportunities for surrounding areas. The Biden-Harris Administration has been focused on supporting recovery, expanding economic opportunity, and improving access to capital for Native people and Tribal communities.
