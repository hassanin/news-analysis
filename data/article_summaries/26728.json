President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order to help veterans transition into the United States Merchant Marine. This move aims to provide more job opportunities for veterans and strengthen the Merchant Marine, which plays a critical role in military readiness. The Merchant Marine transports military goods during times of conflict, often in hostile waters and at great personal risk. In World War II, nearly 10,000 merchant mariners were killed, making their casualty rate higher than any branch of the US military. The executive order is seen as a reflection of the Trump administration's belief that economic security is national security.
