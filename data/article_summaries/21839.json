Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow, a Crow Indian and war veteran, has passed away at the age of 102. He was the first of his people to attend college and earn a Master's degree. During World War II, he displayed bravery and wore traditional war paint and an eagle feather while serving. He was recognized for his courage with awards such as the Bronze Star from America and the Legion d'honneur from France. In 2009, he was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. However, his most significant title was that of war chief, making him the last Crow to hold this distinction. Dr. Medicine Crow dedicated his life to sharing the stories and culture of his people, contributing to a more comprehensive history of America. President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama offer their condolences to his family and the entire Crow Nation.
