The May Employment Situation report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the US economy added 2.5 million jobs last month, and the unemployment rate fell from 14.7% to 13.3%. Job growth in sectors such as leisure and hospitality, construction, education and health services, retail trade, and manufacturing exceeded expectations. A survey conducted in April showed that the majority of laid-off workers expected to be rehired by their previous employers once stay-at-home orders were lifted. The data also indicates a jump in average weekly hours, suggesting pent-up demand and a potential need for more workers. While initial unemployment insurance claims remain elevated, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits has declined, and the gap between continuing claims and initial claims suggests that laid-off Americans are returning to work. Other indicators, such as increased gasoline demand, workplace visits, and the reopening of small businesses, also point to an accelerated economic recovery. However, there is still room for further growth, as the unemployment rate is still higher than before the pandemic. Nonetheless, with more states easing restrictions and growing labor demand, it is expected that the US economy will continue to add jobs in June.
