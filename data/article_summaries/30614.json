President Trump made remarks in the Roosevelt Room about the need to cut regulations in order to stimulate economic growth and create jobs. He stated that his administration has already begun the most far-reaching regulatory reform in American history, including approving long-stalled projects like the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines and cutting years of wasted time and money out of the permitting process for infrastructure projects. He also highlighted the two-for-one rule on new federal regulations, where for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. He claimed that within the first 11 months of his administration, they cancelled or delayed over 1,500 planned regulatory actions, more than any previous President. President Trump also emphasized the need to reduce the size, scope, and cost of federal regulations, and mentioned that the stock market is soaring to new record levels and unemployment is at a 17-year low as a result of their regulatory and other reforms.
