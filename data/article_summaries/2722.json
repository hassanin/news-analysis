President Biden addressed Michigan Democrats at the Huntington Place Convention Center in Detroit. He thanked Governor Gretchen Whitmer for her partnership and praised her leadership. He emphasized the importance of reelecting Whitmer and her team, stating that their accomplishments extend beyond Michigan and have a national impact.

Biden highlighted some of Whitmer's achievements, including making the biggest investment in K-12 education in the state's history and turning a $3 billion deficit into a $7 billion surplus. He also commended her for cutting taxes for small businesses, championing pre-K and childcare for working families, and being a key partner in infrastructure and manufacturing initiatives.

The President stressed that the upcoming election has significant stakes, including the right to choose, the future of Social Security, gun violence prevention, and addressing climate change. He criticized Republicans for their extreme positions, such as supporting a national ban on abortion without exceptions and proposing regular votes on the future of Social Security and Medicare.

Biden highlighted the achievements of his administration, such as job creation, passing the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure Law, and the CHIPS and Science Act. He also mentioned efforts to reduce prescription drug costs, lower healthcare and energy costs, and invest in climate control. He criticized the previous administration's tax cuts for the wealthy and highlighted his efforts to ensure corporations pay their fair share.

The President urged Democrats, independents, and mainstream Republicans to come together to protect American democracy from extreme Republicans who embrace political violence and refuse to accept the will of the people. He emphasized the need to organize, mobilize, and vote to save American democracy.
