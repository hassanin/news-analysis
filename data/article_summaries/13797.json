On May 22, 2003, President Barack Obama declared a national emergency protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and other property in which Iraq has an interest. This was done to address the threats to national security and foreign policy posed by obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of peace and security, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in the country. Since then, the President has modified the scope of the national emergency through various executive orders. Due to the continued threats to national security and foreign policy, President Obama has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice has been published in the Federal Register and will be transmitted to Congress.
