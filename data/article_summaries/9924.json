President Obama provided a progress report on the National Export Initiative (NEI), stating that the goal of doubling exports over five years to support millions of American jobs is on track. The report highlighted significant progress in each of the NEI's five main objectives, including improved advocacy efforts on behalf of U.S. exporters, increased access to export financing, reinforced efforts to remove barriers to trade, enforcement of trade rules, and international promotion of policies leading to strong economic growth. The President also announced the members of the President's Export Council, a group of business and labor leaders who will offer advice on promoting U.S. exports, jobs, and growth.
