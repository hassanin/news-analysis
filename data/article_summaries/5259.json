President Biden is taking steps to crack down on rental housing fees that burden consumers and lack transparency. These fees, such as rental application fees and surprise convenience fees, often exceed the actual cost of providing the service or are added onto rents for services renters assume are included. They can add up to hundreds of dollars for renters and make it difficult to comparison shop. The President is calling for rental housing platforms to show total costs upfront and major platforms have committed to providing consumers with upfront information about fees. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is releasing new research on rental fees and strategies to promote transparency and fairness in the rental market. Several states have already taken action to crack down on rental housing fees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission are also requesting information on tenant screening processes. These efforts are part of the Biden-Harris Administration's ongoing support for renters and aim to create a fairer rental housing market. The administration will work with Congress, state leaders, and the private sector to address rental junk fees in the coming months.
