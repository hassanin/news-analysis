According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly Employment Situation Report, the labor force in the United States remains tight, with wages rising and more people finding work. The unemployment rate is at 3.5 percent, the lowest since May 1969, and the U-4, U-5, and U-6 alternative measures of labor underutilization are at series lows. In 2019, the US added an average of 176,000 jobs per month, surpassing the 70,000 jobs needed to keep pace with working-age population growth. This indicates that workers are coming off the sidelines to find employment. The labor force participation rate for prime-age adults has increased, and employers are raising wages to attract and retain workers. The report suggests that pro-growth policies under President Trump have resulted in higher wage gains for historically disadvantaged Americans. The article concludes that there is still room for the labor force to expand before supply is exhausted and that the Trump Administration's policies continue to support higher wages and more people entering the job market.
