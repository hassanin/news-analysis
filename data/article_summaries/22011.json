The White House has released a memorandum on major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries for fiscal year 2017. The memorandum identifies Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela as major drug transit and/or major illicit drug producing countries. It clarifies that a country's inclusion on the list is not a reflection of its counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States, but rather the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced. The memorandum designates Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed to adhere to international counternarcotics agreements. It also highlights the growing consensus among nations on the need for counternarcotics programs to prioritize health and safety while preventing violence and other harmful consequences. The memorandum discusses the challenges of heroin use, adulterants, and opium poppy cultivation, as well as the production and trafficking of cocaine and coca cultivation. It emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and the implementation of strategies based on the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs' 2009 Political Declaration and Action Plan. The memorandum concludes by stating that the United States will continue to work with other countries to implement the principles agreed upon at the 2016 United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem.
