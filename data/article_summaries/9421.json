President Obama released a statement expressing condolences to the family of Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter, who was killed by the terrorist group ISIL. The President highlighted the contrast between Kassig's humanitarian work in Syria, helping injured and displaced civilians, and ISIL's acts of violence and destruction. He emphasized that ISIL's actions do not represent the Muslim faith, which Kassig had adopted. The President ended the statement by noting that the spirit of goodness and perseverance that Kassig embodied will ultimately overcome the darkness of ISIL.
