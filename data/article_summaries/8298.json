In a press conference in the Roosevelt Room, President Biden urged Congress to pass supplemental funding for Ukraine before the holiday recess. He criticized Republicans for potentially abandoning global leadership and giving Putin a gift by not holding him accountable for his actions in Ukraine. Biden emphasized that if Putin takes Ukraine, he will not stop there and will continue his aggressive actions. The President called on Congress to prioritize national security and not let partisan politics hinder their responsibilities. He also discussed the need for real solutions at the border, expressing his willingness to make compromises and fix the broken immigration system. However, he criticized Republicans for rejecting bipartisan compromises and potentially damaging national security by holding Ukraine's funding hostage. Biden emphasized the importance of the United States standing with Ukraine and against Putin's tyranny. He urged Congress to do the right thing and emphasized that the entire world is watching. The President also briefly addressed allegations about his family's business interests, dismissing them as lies.
