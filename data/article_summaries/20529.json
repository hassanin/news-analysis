Vice President Joe Biden had a call with Iraqi Kurdistan Regional President Masoud Barzani. They discussed recent security and political developments. They also talked about the passage of congressional legislation that removes restrictions on members of the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan under U.S. immigration laws. This new law should make it easier for Iraqi Kurds to visit the United States. They also discussed the courage of the Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi Security Forces fighting against ISIL. President Barzani thanked the United States and the international community for their support. They both noted the improved cooperation between Erbil and Baghdad and agreed to work together with other Iraqi leaders to foster collaboration among Iraq's different communities.
