The White House has released a fact sheet outlining enhancements to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) in response to the recent terrorist attacks in Paris. The VWP allows citizens of 38 partner countries to travel to the United States without a visa. The fact sheet highlights the layered security measures in place to detect and prevent potential threats, including comprehensive screening before departure and upon arrival in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made several enhancements to the VWP in the past year, such as additional data fields in the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application and new traveler screening requirements. In light of the Paris attacks, the DHS will modify the ESTA application to include information on past travel to countries considered terrorist safe havens. The DHS will also conduct a review of VWP partner countries and explore the use of biometrics to increase security. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will evaluate terrorism information sharing between the United States and VWP countries and propose options to address any deficiencies. The DHS will offer assistance to facilitate terrorism information sharing and promote the Global Entry program, which includes biometrics, among VWP partners. The DHS will seek authority from Congress to increase fines for air carriers that fail to verify passport data, and deploy Foreign Fighter Surge Teams to counter terrorist travel. The Administration is also working with Congress to provide statutory authority for key security enhancements and explore the use of biometrics in the VWP process. The fact sheet concludes by mentioning the expansion of the DHS' Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Preclearance program, which involves inspecting passengers and their baggage at foreign airports before departure for the United States.
