The White House has announced the recipients of $450 million in job-driven training grants. The grants will be given to nearly 270 community colleges across the country, in partnership with more than 400 employers. The funding is part of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) competitive grant program, which aims to train Americans with the skills they need for in-demand jobs in industries like information technology, healthcare, energy, and advanced manufacturing. Some of the highlights of the grant awards include partnerships with employers such as Exxon-Mobil, IBM, Delta, Jetblue, CVS, and Habitat for Humanity, as well as a focus on training programs for information technology and cybersecurity jobs. The grants will help train low-wage workers for middle-class jobs and address the projected national shortage of IT workers. The White House plans to continue investing in job-driven training partnerships and has proposed a $6 billion Community College Job-Driven Training Fund in the 2015 budget. Additionally, the Department of Education is releasing a new report on transforming adult learning through work, and the Department of Labor is releasing $2 million in grants for the Pathways to Careers: Community College for Youth and Young Adults with Disabilities Project.
