President Obama announced in an op-ed in Indian Country Today that he will be visiting the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in Cannonball, N.D. on June 13, accompanied by the First Lady. This will be his first visit to Indian Country since taking office. During his presidency, Obama has worked closely with tribal leaders and created the White House Council on Native American Affairs to ensure partnership between the federal government and tribal communities. His administration has made progress in strengthening justice and tribal sovereignty, resolving disputes, increasing access to healthcare, and expanding opportunities for Native Americans. However, Obama acknowledges that more needs to be done, especially in addressing high poverty rates and dropout rates among Native Americans. During his upcoming trip, he plans to listen to the concerns and challenges faced by tribal communities and announce new initiatives to expand opportunity in Indian Country. Obama believes that his administration has turned a corner in honoring agreements, respecting tribal sovereignty, and providing opportunities for every American Indian and Alaskan Native to succeed.
