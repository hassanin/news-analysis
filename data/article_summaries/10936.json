The Small Business Administration (SBA) has announced that it will expand eligibility for SBA-backed loans, making more than 70,000 additional small businesses eligible for these loans. This includes auto and RV dealerships, auto industry suppliers, and others. The move is aimed at providing greater access to capital for small businesses during the tough economic times. The temporary change to the eligibility criteria will be in effect from early next week through September 30, 2010. The net worth for the company and its affiliates must not exceed $8.5 million, and the average net income after federal income taxes for the preceding two fiscal years must not be more than $3 million. This change will also allow more small businesses to take advantage of benefits provided through the Recovery Act. Since the implementation of the Recovery Act, the SBA has seen an increase in 7(a) loan volume and new loans being made by lenders.
