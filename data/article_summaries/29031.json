The Council of Economic Advisers discusses the adverse effects of school closures caused by the pandemic shutdown. They estimate that the three months of closures between March and May 2020 may reduce children's future potential earnings by 2.3 - 3.7 percent. In addition to the impact on children, parents also face challenges when schools remain closed, such as limited choices for alternative childcare. The lack of access to broadband internet, food security, engaged learning, and interventions for maltreatment are real concerns for many Americans. Online learning is not a perfect substitute for in-person learning, and it particularly affects minority and low-income groups. The CEA estimates that if remote learning is half as effective as in-person learning, children may face a 3.5 - 5.5 percent decrease in future projected earnings. Opening schools for in-person instruction may boost students' long-term earnings prospects. Schools also serve as mandatory reporters for child maltreatment, and without their intervention, there may be cases of unreported abuse. The adverse effects of school closures also extend to parents, who must find alternatives to childcare and may experience collective earning losses. The article argues that the science has shown that children are at low risk for COVID-19, and school closures had little effect on the spread of the virus. Therefore, they suggest being mindful of the prolonged effects of school closures on children and parents while protecting the most vulnerable.
