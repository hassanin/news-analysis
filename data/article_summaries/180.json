Since President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 100 days ago, the Biden-Harris Administration has been making significant progress in implementing the largest long-term investment in America's infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. The law aims to rebuild crumbling roads and bridges, replace lead pipes, provide high-speed internet to every family in America, and bring about concrete results that improve people's lives. The Administration has established an Infrastructure Implementation Task Force to ensure the delivery of results to the American people and has made over 60 presidential and cabinet visits to communities across the country to showcase the benefits of the law. The White House has released a guidebook to help state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments understand and unlock the benefits of the law, and has launched an "Infrastructure School" webinar series to provide more in-depth information and allow communities to ask questions. The Administration has also requested Governors and local leaders to appoint infrastructure coordinators to manage the flow of funds to their states. The White House is committed to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and has met with Inspectors General and the Government Accountability Office to ensure transparency, appropriate oversight, and efficient use of funds. So far, nearly $100 billion has been announced for roads, highways, bridges, ports, airports, and water systems, with an additional nearly $50 billion in funding availability. The Administration has also established new offices and action plans to ensure wise and efficient implementation of these investments in transportation, climate, energy, the environment, and high-speed internet.
