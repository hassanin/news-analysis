President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan, which was declared in Executive Order 13067 in 1997, will continue beyond November 3, 2019. Despite recent positive developments, the actions and policies of the Sudanese government that led to the declaration of the national emergency have not been resolved and continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Trump has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
