The Biden-Harris Administration is launching an initiative called Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW) to address supply chain vulnerabilities and congestion. FLOW aims to speed up the movement of goods and reduce costs for consumers by improving information exchange and coordination in the supply chain. The initiative will involve collaboration between various stakeholders, including private businesses, logistics companies, ports, and more. The Department of Transportation (DOT) will lead the effort to develop a proof-of-concept information exchange by the end of the summer. FLOW is designed to enhance the resilience and efficiency of the supply chain by improving visibility, agility, and redundancy. The lack of digital infrastructure and transparency in the supply chain has been a challenge, causing delays and increasing costs. The initial partners in FLOW include port authorities, ocean carriers, terminal operators, logistics and warehousing companies, and other businesses. The Biden-Harris Administration is also inviting additional stakeholders to participate in FLOW and contribute to the long-term improvement of freight infrastructure. This initiative builds on the ongoing efforts of the Biden-Harris Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to ensure a smooth flow of cargo from ships to shelves.
