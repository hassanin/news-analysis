President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2020," which requires the development and implementation of a strategy for secure wireless communications technology in the United States and abroad. The strategy aims to protect the American people from security threats to telecommunications networks and 5G technology. However, the President has stated that he will treat certain provisions of the Act in a manner that does not interfere with his exclusive constitutional authorities in foreign relations. Additionally, the President believes that the Act does not prevent him or future Presidents from exercising their constitutional authorities to ensure the proper implementation of the entire strategy.
