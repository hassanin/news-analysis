The article highlights the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines in Ottawa, Canada. Over 160 countries have joined the convention to address the indiscriminate threat of these weapons, particularly to civilians. The Biden-Harris Administration is aligning US policy with the convention and taking action to reduce reliance on landmines. This includes removing excess weapons and pursuing alternatives, while still meeting alliance commitments. The US has also contributed over $4.7 billion in aid to more than 100 countries for the safe clearance and destruction of landmines and other explosive weapons. Senator Patrick Leahy's leadership and efforts are acknowledged for his role in improving the lives of those affected by war remnants. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to working towards a world free from these weapons.
