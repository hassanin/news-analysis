President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria will continue beyond May 11, 2021. The President cites the regime's brutality, repression of the Syrian people, pursuit and use of chemical weapons, and support for terrorist organizations as reasons for the national emergency. The United States also condemns the Assad regime's violence and human rights violations and calls for a ceasefire, delivery of humanitarian assistance, and a political settlement in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254. The President will consider changes in Syria's policies and actions when deciding whether to continue or terminate the national emergency in the future.
