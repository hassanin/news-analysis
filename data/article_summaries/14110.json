The White House Council on Women and Girls, together with the U.S. Department of Education, the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality, and The National Crittenton Foundation, hosted a conference titled "Trauma-Informed Approaches in School: Supporting Girls of Color and Rethinking Discipline." The conference aimed to improve school systems' discipline practices and develop approaches that better serve students who have experienced trauma. Girls of color often face disproportionately high rates of school suspensions. Additionally, trauma from sexual assault can hinder a girl's success in school. The White House announced additional supports from the U.S. Department of Education and the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault to address sexual assault misconduct in schools. This includes the release of an online resource package called "Safe Place to Learn" and a document highlighting considerations for school district sexual misconduct policies. External commitments were also made to support trauma-informed approaches to school discipline, such as an online community support for educators and a fellowship focused on best practices in school discipline reform efforts. The conference brought together educational teams from 15 states and 23 school districts, along with researchers, experts, and nonprofit partners. This conference builds on the Administration's commitment to fostering school success for all youth and reducing unnecessary exclusionary school discipline practices.
