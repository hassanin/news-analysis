This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by Donald J. Trump on January 24, 2017. The memorandum focuses on the construction of American pipelines. It states that all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines within the United States, should use materials and equipment produced in the United States to the maximum extent possible and as permitted by law. The Secretary of Commerce is tasked with developing a plan in consultation with relevant executive departments and agencies, and submitting it to the President within 180 days. The memorandum also clarifies that for iron or steel products to be considered "produced in the United States," all manufacturing processes, from melting to coating, must occur within the country. Steel or iron materials or products manufactured abroad from semi-finished steel or iron from the United States, as well as those manufactured in the United States from semi-finished steel or iron of foreign origin, are not considered "produced in the United States" for the purposes of this memorandum. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
