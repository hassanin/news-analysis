First Lady Michelle Obama will be hosting an event at the White House on April 6, 2016, to celebrate Nowruz. Nowruz is a New Year celebration observed by over 300 million people from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds across the Middle East, Central and Southwest Asia, and Eastern Europe. The holiday signifies the beginning of spring, the renewal of nature, and the welcoming of a positive and healthy new year. The event will include Persian cuisine and the traditional Nowruz table, called the "Haft Seen," which consists of seven items symbolizing concepts like renewal, joy, love, beauty, health, and patience.
