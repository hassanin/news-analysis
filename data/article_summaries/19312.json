In this article, President Barack Obama requests the Congress to consider budget amendments for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for fiscal year 2011. The proposed amendments do not increase the discretionary budget authority. The amendments include increases for healthcare workforce enhancement activities, HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention, State health insurance consumer assistance programs, and existing State high-risk health insurance pools. There are also requests for changes to appropriations language that support the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise Review. The details of these amendments can be found in the enclosed letter from the Acting Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
