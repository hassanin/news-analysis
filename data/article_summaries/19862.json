The United States provides support to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for nuclear security. The IAEA plays a key role in coordinating nuclear security activities and supports member states in securing nuclear and radiological materials. The United States has contributed over $130 million to the IAEA's Nuclear Security Fund since 2002. This funding helps the IAEA develop guidance and training for nuclear security, improve regulatory oversight and infrastructure, combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials, mitigate insider threats at nuclear facilities, and support the implementation of international legal frameworks for nuclear security. The United States also works with the IAEA to convert research reactors and isotope production facilities from highly enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel, and to remove HEU once it is no longer required. The United States also supports the IAEA and member states in improving emergency preparedness and response capabilities.
