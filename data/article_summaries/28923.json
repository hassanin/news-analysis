January's jobs numbers indicate that the economy is thriving, with wages growing and business optimism remaining strong. US employers added 304,000 jobs in January, surpassing expectations, although the unemployment rate increased slightly to 4 percent. Average hourly earnings rose by 3 cents to $27.56, marking a 3.2 percent increase over the past year. This growth in wages and salaries is the first time in over 10 years that the threshold of 3 percent has been broken. The stock market also performed well in January, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 posting their biggest monthly gains since 1989 and 1987, respectively. Additionally, a survey revealed that 79 percent of businesses plan to add more jobs, with executives citing the 2017 tax cuts as a contributing factor. The Congressional Budget Office confirmed the strength of the economy, projecting growth in real disposable income and consumer spending. Investor and business optimism about the 10-year economic outlook is also on the rise. Furthermore, manufacturing activity has been robust, as indicated by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's business activity index and the increase in industrial production, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturers are optimistic about future growth in new orders, output, and employment.
