The Biden-Harris Administration is partnering with Caribbean nations to address their top priorities of energy security, access to finance, and food security. Three High-Level Action Committees have been established to develop solutions, and meetings have been held to formulate action plans. Vice President Harris will meet with Caribbean leaders in September to review progress. The Joint Action Plans will leverage engagement, assistance, capacity building, and partnerships to strengthen energy security, improve access to finance, and enhance food security. These actions align with the U.S.-Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis. The article also mentions specific actions in each area and the implementation of the Zero Hunger Caribbean Plan.
