The article is a statement by the White House Press Secretary regarding funding for fiscal year 2011. The press secretary expresses satisfaction that Democrats and Republicans were able to reach an agreement to avoid a government shutdown by making significant spending cuts while still investing in the future. The deal ensures that small businesses will continue to receive loans, families will continue to receive mortgages, and government workers and military personnel will receive their paychecks on time. The press secretary acknowledges that there are still challenges ahead, such as growing the economy and reducing the deficit, but emphasizes the need to build on this bipartisan compromise to meet the expectations of the American people. The President has laid out a vision to reduce long-term debt and put the nation on a more responsible fiscal trajectory. This will involve finding additional savings in the federal government while protecting investments that will create new industries and jobs. The goal is to reduce the deficit and live within our means, just like millions of Americans do each day, in order to provide rising opportunities for future generations.
