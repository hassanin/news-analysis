White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki held a briefing to address the recent attack in Kabul, Afghanistan. Psaki expressed condolences for the victims and announced that the United States flag will be flown at half-staff in their honor. She clarified that while the President acknowledged that not every Afghan who wants to leave will be able to do so, the commitment to evacuate American citizens, partners, and allies remains. Psaki also reiterated that there is no change in the plan to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan by August 31st. She stated that the U.S. does not trust the Taliban but must coordinate with them to continue evacuation efforts. Psaki emphasized that the U.S. will maintain over-the-horizon capacity to prevent terrorist attacks on the homeland. When asked about the future relationship with the Taliban, Psaki stated that the focus is on getting people out of Afghanistan and that any future coordination would not be labeled a partnership. Psaki also addressed concerns about the safety of U.S. citizens after the 31st and stated that efforts to evacuate them will continue.
