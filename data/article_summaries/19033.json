On April 1, 2015, the President signed into law H.R. 1527, known as the "Slain Officer Family Support Act of 2015." This law allows taxpayers to speed up the income tax benefits for charitable cash contributions made between January 1, 2015, and April 15, 2015, to support the families of two slain New York Police Department detectives, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos.
