The White House has released a fact sheet outlining the Student Aid Bill of Rights, which aims to provide strong consumer protections for student loan borrowers. The Bill of Rights includes several actions to help borrowers afford their monthly loan payments, such as creating a complaint system, helping set affordable monthly payments, and analyzing student debt trends. The fact sheet also highlights the importance of access to quality, affordable education and resources to pay for college. The actions outlined in the fact sheet include creating a responsive student feedback system, improving customer service for borrowers, and prioritizing further steps to meet the needs of student borrowers. The fact sheet also mentions other initiatives by the Obama administration, such as the America's College Promise proposal for free community college and the development of a college ratings system. The fact sheet emphasizes the importance of ensuring that every student has access to a quality education and that every borrower has the right to an affordable repayment plan and fair treatment.
