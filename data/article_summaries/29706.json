On May 11, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to establish the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. The commission's mission is to study the registration and voting processes used in federal elections and submit a report to the President. The report should identify laws, rules, policies, activities, strategies, and practices that enhance or undermine the American people's confidence in the integrity of the voting processes. It should also identify vulnerabilities in voting systems and practices that could lead to improper voter registrations and fraudulent voting. The commission will be chaired by the Vice President and composed of not more than 15 additional members appointed by the President. The commission will hold public meetings, engage with government officials and election law experts, and strive to avoid duplicating the efforts of existing government entities. The General Services Administration will provide administrative services and support to the commission. The commission will terminate 30 days after it submits its report to the President. Members of the commission will serve without additional compensation but will be allowed travel expenses. The order emphasizes that it should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It also states that it does not create any right or benefit enforceable by any party against the United States or any other entity.
