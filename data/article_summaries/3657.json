The United States congratulates the first cohort of Quad Fellows from Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. This Fellowship was officially opened at the second in-person Quad Leaders' Summit in May, with President Biden, Prime Minister Albanese, Prime Minister Modi, and Prime Minister Kishida. The group consists of 100 students, with 25 from each Quad country, who are seen as the next-generation of great STEM minds. They have shown commitment to advancing innovation and collaboration among the four democracies and have a passion for creating a better future for the Indo-Pacific and the world. President Biden has elevated the Quad partnership to new heights, and it is expected to continue growing in the coming years. These young fellows will bring the Quad closer together, and their leadership gives confidence that the future is in good hands.
