The U.S. economy grew at a solid 2.9 percent annual rate in the final three months of last year, according to a report from the Commerce Department. This is a sharp upward revision from the previous estimate of 2.5 percent growth. It also caps off three consecutive quarters of healthy growth. The increase in growth is attributed in part to increased consumer spending on services such as auto repairs. Overall consumer spending grew at the fastest pace in three years. President Trump sees this increase in growth as evidence that his economic program, including tax cuts and deregulation, is having a positive impact.
