The White House is investing $90 million through ApprenticeshipUSA to expand pathways into the middle class. Job-driven apprenticeships are seen as a way to provide workers with the skills and knowledge needed for good-paying jobs. The Department of Labor will be using the funding to support state strategies to expand apprenticeship, catalyze industry partnerships in fast-growing and high-tech industries, and launch national efforts to make it easier for employers to start apprenticeship programs. The goal is to increase access to apprenticeship and diversify the workforce. The Department of Labor will also be providing support to help employers start or grow apprenticeship programs, particularly in high-growth and high-tech industries. The investments will focus on leveraging collaborations with workforce development organizations, industry associations, labor groups, and training providers. The goal is to accelerate the expansion of apprenticeship nationwide. Furthermore, the investments will focus on making apprenticeships more inclusive and increasing access for traditionally underrepresented populations such as women, minorities, and people with disabilities. The Department of Labor will be investing in strategies to build pathways to apprenticeship, expand recruiting efforts, and promote greater access to apprenticeships for underrepresented groups. These investments will complement state-level efforts and support national activities to increase access to apprenticeship. The Obama Administration has been focused on increasing access to apprenticeship and jobs-driven training, including investing $175 million in American Apprenticeship Grants and highlighting the value of apprenticeships through the ApprenticeshipUSA LEADERS program. They have also expanded opportunities for apprentices to earn college credit towards a degree and directed training investments into job-driven strategies.
