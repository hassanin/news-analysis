Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder have announced grants to twelve programs across the country to address the urgent need to reduce domestic violence homicides. On average, three women die each day as a result of domestic violence, with research showing that women who are threatened with a gun or other weapon by their partner are 20 times more likely to be subsequently murdered. The grants, totaling $2.3 million, are part of the Domestic Violence Homicide Prevention Demonstration Initiative (DVHP Initiative) created by the Justice Department's Office on Violence Against Women. The initiative aims to help state and local jurisdictions reduce domestic violence homicides by identifying potential victims and monitoring high-risk offenders. The program is modeled after successful programs in Massachusetts and Maryland, where coordinated teams of law enforcement, prosecutors, health professionals, and victim services significantly reduced domestic violence homicide rates. The grants will support evidence-based domestic violence homicide prevention models that can predict potentially lethal behavior and take steps to stop the escalation of violence. The twelve sites receiving grants include Contra Costa County, CA; Miami-Dade County, FL; Palm Beach County, FL; Rockdale County, GA; Winnebago County, IL; City of Boston, MA; Borough of Brooklyn, NY; Westchester County, NY; Pitt County, NC; Cuyahoga County, OH; City of North Charleston, SC; and City of Rutland, VT. After the initial assessment phase, up to six sites will be selected to continue a three-year implementation phase. The Office on Violence Against Women will partner with the National Institute of Justice to monitor the initiative and evaluate its outcomes.
