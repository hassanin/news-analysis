Japan has adopted a new National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and Defense Buildup Program to strengthen and defend the free and open Indo-Pacific. The strategy aims to build a strong community of partners and allies to support peace and stability in the region. Japan also plans to increase defense investments to modernize the U.S.-Japan Alliance. The new strategy highlights Japan's commitment to international peace, nuclear nonproliferation, and positions it as a leader in 2023 when it joins the United Nations Security Council and hosts the G7. Japan's leadership is also recognized for its support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.
