President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Arkansas due to a severe winter storm that occurred in December 2013. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The affected counties include Crawford, Franklin, Johnson, Logan, Madison, Marion, Newton, Polk, Scott, Searcy, Sebastian, Sharp, and Van Buren. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will be coordinating federal recovery operations in the area, and additional counties may receive assistance after damage assessments are completed.
