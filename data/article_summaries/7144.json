During a visit to W.S. Jenks & Son, a hardware store in Washington, D.C., President Biden met with the store's employees and discussed their experiences during the pandemic. The store, which has been operating since 1866, had to adapt to the challenges brought about by COVID-19. The owner, Mr. Siegel, mentioned that they had to send their at-risk employees home and continue paying them. The store also participated in job fairs for special needs programs and hired three individuals from those programs. They have been impacted by the decrease in government and commercial sales, which usually account for 60% of their annual revenue. President Biden acknowledged the difficulties faced by small businesses during the pandemic and mentioned changes made to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to prioritize smaller businesses and minority-owned businesses. The store also highlighted its commitment to sustainability, with two urban farms and solar panels on the premises.
