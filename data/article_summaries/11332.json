In this statement, the President discusses the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act and highlights its benefits. He emphasizes that the law aims to provide health care security to hard-working, middle-class families and protect Americans from insurance company abuses. He mentions the positive impact of the law, such as seniors saving money on prescription drugs and young people being able to stay on their family's health plan until age 26. The President also mentions that preventive care is covered free of charge and that the growth of healthcare costs is slowing down. He emphasizes that the law prevents insurance companies from canceling policies, denying coverage, or charging women more than men. He mentions that soon, no American will be denied care or charged more due to pre-existing conditions. The President announces that Americans will have the opportunity to buy health care plans through a new health insurance marketplace, where private plans will compete to save middle-class families money. He assures that individuals can keep their current plans if they like them, and financial assistance will be available for those who cannot afford a plan. The President acknowledges that there is more work to be done to implement the law and expresses his willingness to work with leaders from both parties to help Americans save money on health care and extend coverage to every family.
