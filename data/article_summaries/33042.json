The US government has publicly attributed the WannaCry cyber attack to North Korea, stating that the attack was "careless and reckless" and affected individuals, industry, and governments worldwide. The US has evidence to support this attribution and has received agreement from other governments and private companies. The US is calling on the private sector to increase its accountability in the cyber realm by taking actions that deny North Korea the ability to launch cyber attacks. The US also plans to strengthen international partnerships with cybersecurity centers around the world. The US government has a process in place for disclosing vulnerabilities to software producers so that they can be patched and increase the collective defense of the country.
