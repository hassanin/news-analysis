National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall hosted a meeting at the White House with representatives from various foreign governments, private companies, civil society, and international organizations to discuss expanding lawful pathways and providing an alternative to human smugglers for vulnerable migrants. They highlighted the progress made under the Safe Mobility Office Initiative, launched earlier this year with countries like Canada, Spain, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Colombia. The initiative aims to process and refer migrants to legal pathways through physical locations and a digital portal. The administration also discussed partnering with the private sector and other organizations to further develop the initiative. This event is part of the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to engage with regional partners, international organizations, and the private sector to address the migration challenge in the Western Hemisphere, as outlined in the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.
