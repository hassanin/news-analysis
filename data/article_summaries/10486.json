The White House has announced that more than two dozen foundations, companies, and nonprofit organizations have committed to funding trips to national parks and other public lands for nearly half a million 4th grade children as part of the Every Kid in a Park initiative. This initiative, launched in September 2015, provides all 4th graders and their families with free access to public lands and waters for a full year. The commitments include funding transportation costs, honoring the Every Kid in a Park pass in state parks, distributing resources to 4th grade classrooms, and hosting events and field trips. The organizations that have signed on to support the initiative include the American Recreation Coalition, Amtrak, REI, Girl Scouts of the USA, National Park Foundation, Sierra Club, and YMCA of the USA, among others.
