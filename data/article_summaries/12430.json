President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, stating that the national emergency with respect to Libya, declared in Executive Order 13566 in 2011, is to continue beyond February 25, 2015. The letter cites the extreme measures taken by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his government against the people of Libya, as well as the risk of misappropriation of Libyan state assets. The ongoing violence and instability in Libya, as well as the threat to regional stability, are reasons for the continuation of the national emergency. The letter emphasizes the need for sanctions to remain in effect and for those who obstruct Libya's democratic transition to be held accountable. The situation in Libya is still considered an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
