The article discusses President Biden's efforts to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is the most significant investment in infrastructure since the Eisenhower Administration. The law aims to create jobs, boost the economy, invest in communities, combat climate change, promote innovation and manufacturing, and lower costs for American families. It includes funding for clean energy, a stronger electric grid, cleaner transportation, and addressing legacy pollution. The Biden-Harris Administration is focused on implementing the law effectively and accelerating infrastructure projects with the help of federal, state, and local governments, as well as the private sector. The administration has released a Permitting Action Plan to expedite federal permitting and environmental reviews. The recently-signed Inflation Reduction Act provides funding for the timely review of major federal infrastructure projects. The article also mentions the White House Accelerating Infrastructure Summit, where new efforts and an Action Plan are being announced to further accelerate infrastructure rebuilding and maximize the opportunity to improve America's infrastructure.
