The White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) has announced its 2017 HBCU All-Stars. These All-Stars are undergraduate, graduate, and professional students who have been recognized for their outstanding accomplishments. They will serve as ambassadors of the White House Initiative on HBCUs for one year, providing outreach and communication to their fellow students about the value of education and the Initiative as a networking resource. The All-Stars were highly recommended by HBCU administrators and were selected from a wide range of applicants.
