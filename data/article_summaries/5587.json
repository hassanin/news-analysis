The FDA and CDC have announced that booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine will be available to Americans aged 65 and older and those at high risk of COVID-19. The decision was made after the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices reviewed the data and recommended the use of boosters for these populations. The CDC Director endorsed the committee's recommendations and also allowed for 18- to 49-year-olds with underlying medical conditions to receive a booster shot. The decision to provide boosters to those at high risk due to occupational or institutional exposure was a close vote, but the CDC Director would have voted "yes" in favor of it. The FDA and CDC have ensured that there is enough supply of booster shots for all eligible Americans and have worked with various partners, including pharmacies, to administer the shots. It is important to note that getting vaccinated with the primary series is still the most effective way to protect against COVID-19, and efforts to vaccinate the unvaccinated will continue. The CDC will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and provide updated recommendations as needed.
