The White House Press Secretary released a statement expressing concern about the anticipated release of classified State Department cables by WikiLeaks. The statement emphasizes that these cables contain candid and incomplete information, and their release could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders. The statement warns that such disclosures can deeply impact US foreign policy interests, as well as those of allies and friends around the world. It also highlights the potential risks to diplomats, intelligence professionals, and individuals working under oppressive regimes who are trying to promote democracy and open government. The President supports responsible, accountable, and open government, but considers the release of stolen and classified documents as reckless and dangerous. The unauthorized disclosure of classified documents and sensitive national security information is strongly condemned.
