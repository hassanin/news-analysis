The Obama Administration is holding a major oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico, covering more than 21 million acres that are currently not leased. This is part of the Administration's efforts to expand safe and responsible domestic oil and gas production. The sale is one of several steps announced by President Obama in May 2011, which included additional lease sales, offshore lease extensions, and streamlining permitting processes. The Department of the Interior estimates that the lease sale could result in the production of millions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. The Administration is focused on ensuring that the expansion of domestic oil and gas production is done safely, implementing safety reforms for offshore drilling after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Since then, the Administration has approved numerous permits that meet the new safety standards.
