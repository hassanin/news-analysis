The Indiana legislature has passed a near-total abortion ban following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. This move has been criticized as another attempt by Republican legislators to limit women's reproductive rights and give politicians control over healthcare decisions. It is urged that Americans voice their concerns, and Congress should pass a law to restore the protections of Roe in order to secure a woman's right to choose nationwide. President Biden is also committed to taking action to protect women's reproductive rights and access to care under federal law.
