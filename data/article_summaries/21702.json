One year ago, President Obama announced a change in America's relationship with Cuba, prioritizing the interests of both countries over outdated policies. Since then, important steps have been taken to normalize relations, including the re-establishment of diplomatic relations and the opening of embassies. Greater travel and commerce between the two countries have been facilitated, leading to increased interactions between Americans and Cubans. Additionally, efforts have been made to promote the free flow of information to, from, and within Cuba. The United States is now in a stronger position to engage with the people and governments of the hemisphere. The President calls on Congress to lift the embargo that has been a failed policy and to support a better life for the Cuban people. While differences with the Cuban government still exist, the U.S. raises these issues directly and remains committed to human rights and universal values. The process of normalization will be a long journey, but the progress made in the past year serves as a reminder of the potential for a better future. Moving forward, both Cubans and Americans will continue to be empowered to lead the way.
