The Obama Administration has announced that it will expedite 5 major port projects in the United States as part of its We Can't Wait initiative. The ports that will be modernized and expanded include the Port of Jacksonville, the Port of Miami, the Port of Savannah, the Port of New York and New Jersey, and the Port of Charleston. The Administration aims to make the permitting and review process for infrastructure projects more efficient and effective, saving time and driving better outcomes for local communities. This is the first phase of expedited projects, with more to be announced in the coming weeks. The Administration has also established a Task Force to develop a Federal strategy and coordinated decision-making principles for coastal ports and related infrastructure. Each port project has a target date for completing all federal permit and review decisions, ranging from April 2013 to September 2015. The projects involve deepening the navigation channels, constructing intermodal container facilities, and raising the height of bridges to accommodate larger cargo vessels and improve the movement of goods.
