The article discusses the National Strategy for Global Supply Chain Security, which focuses on strengthening the global supply chain to protect the welfare and interests of the American people and secure the nation's economic prosperity. The global supply chain is essential for the efficient and secure movement of goods across borders, supporting critical infrastructure sectors and driving economies. However, it is increasingly at risk from disruptions such as natural hazards, accidents, and malicious incidents. The strategy aims to promote the efficient and secure movement of goods while reducing vulnerability to disruption. It also aims to foster a resilient supply chain that can withstand evolving threats and recover quickly from disruptions. The approach is guided by principles such as galvanizing action and managing supply chain risk. The strategy will be implemented through engagement with the international community and industry stakeholders, seeking feedback and recommendations on areas such as refining understanding of global supply chain threats, improving threat detection and information sharing, building resilient critical infrastructures, improving capacity for commerce, and embracing global standards.
