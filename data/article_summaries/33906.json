The article discusses President Trump's efforts to promote economic freedom by reducing excessive regulations. It highlights the creation of the Governors' Initiative on Regulatory Innovation, which aims to align local, state, and federal regulations and advance occupational licensing reform. The Trump Administration has surpassed its promise of removing two regulations for each new one, issuing 150 deregulatory actions and only 35 new significant regulatory actions last year. This has resulted in significant benefits for the American people. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that the slower pace of new regulations and deregulatory actions will raise real incomes for U.S. households by $3,100 per year once fully implemented. The article also mentions specific regulations, such as the SAFE Vehicles Rule and reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act, which are expected to generate economic benefits. Additionally, the Administration has taken deregulatory actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The article concludes by stating that continued deregulation and expansion of certain actions, such as telemedicine adoption and FDA approval times, could generate further benefits for the American people. The Trump Administration remains committed to reducing regulations and supporting American families and businesses.
