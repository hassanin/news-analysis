President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of New York and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts due to Hurricane Sandy. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in several counties, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and hazard mitigation statewide. Michael F. Byrne has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
