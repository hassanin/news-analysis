The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a presidential memorandum on major illicit drug transit and producing countries for fiscal year 2012. The memorandum identifies Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela as major drug transit or producing countries. It states that a country's presence on the list does not necessarily reflect its counternarcotics efforts or cooperation with the United States. The memorandum also designates Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed to make substantial efforts to adhere to international counternarcotics agreements. It highlights the drug trafficking routes and cultivation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as the vulnerabilities and challenges faced by El Salvador, Belize, and Central American countries in relation to drug trafficking. The memorandum also mentions the strengthening drug trafficking ties between South America and West Africa and the production and trafficking of marijuana and synthetic drugs in Canada. The memorandum concludes by authorizing and directing the submission of the determination to Congress and its publication in the Federal Register.
