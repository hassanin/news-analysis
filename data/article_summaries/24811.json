President Obama has declared a major disaster in Vermont due to the impact of Tropical Storm Irene. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will assist affected individuals with grants for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. State and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, can also receive federal funding for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for cost-sharing funding. Craig A. Gilbert has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated after damage assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
