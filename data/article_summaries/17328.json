President Obama has signed a major disaster declaration for the state of Alabama, ordering federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding occurred between December 23-31, 2015. The federal funding will be available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, to cover the cost of emergency work and repairs or replacement of damaged facilities. The funding will also be available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Elizabeth Turner has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made later if requested by the state.
