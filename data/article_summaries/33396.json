The recently signed government funding bills contain several victories for the Trump administration and the American people. These include a $22 billion increase in defense spending, a 3.1% pay raise for the military, and the establishment of the United States Space Force. The bills also provide robust funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, improving care options for veterans. Additionally, the legislation increases access to affordable childcare, expands apprenticeships and workforce development programs, and extends the paid parental leave tax credit. It also allocates $75 million for the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform initiative. Pro-life protections are preserved, including the Hyde Amendment, and funding for pro-abortion organizations is rejected. The legislation also maintains the president's authority to build the border wall, prevents cuts to ICE detention beds, and supports successful strategies in reducing illegal border crossings. Finally, the bills repeal the Obamacare Medical Device Tax and the Cadillac Tax, which would have imposed financial burdens on employers and employees. Overall, the funding bills address critical priorities such as military investment, prosperity, health, border security, criminal justice reform, and the defense of life.
