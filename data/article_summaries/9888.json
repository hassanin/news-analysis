Laura Pollán, the founder of Las Damas de Blanco, has passed away in Havana. The President expresses his condolences to her family, friends, and colleagues. The Ladies in White, led by Pollán, have been instrumental in raising awareness about the unjust imprisonment of political prisoners in Cuba. The Obama administration has supported the Cuban people's desire for freedom and will continue to do so in Pollán's memory.
