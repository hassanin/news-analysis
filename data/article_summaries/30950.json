On October 27, 2006, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency regarding the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and implemented measures to block the property of individuals contributing to the conflict in the country. This action was taken due to the extraordinary threat posed by the violence and atrocities in the DRC to the foreign policy and regional stability of the United States. The national emergency was further addressed in a subsequent executive order in 2014. The current situation in the DRC still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States, so the national emergency declared in 2006 and the measures taken to address it will remain in effect beyond October 27, 2020. This decision is made in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
