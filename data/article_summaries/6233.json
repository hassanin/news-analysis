The article discusses the child tax credit provided by the American Rescue Plan, which aims to provide tax relief to America's working families with children. The child tax credit has been increased to $3000 for families with children between 6-17 years old and $3600 for families with children under 6 years old. Half of the tax cut can be paid to families in advance through a monthly check or direct deposit. This year, a family with two young children could receive a tax cut of $7200, with a monthly payment of $600 starting in July. Almost all families who have filed taxes in the last two years will receive this tax cut automatically. The article emphasizes the importance of spreading awareness about the tax relief and ensuring that all eligible families receive the full credit. It also mentions that if every family signs up, it could significantly reduce child poverty and calls for support and extension of the child tax credit through the American Families Plan. The article provides a link to ChildTaxCredit.Gov, where families can find information and sign up for the credit. The author concludes by encouraging everyone to work together to ensure that those who need the help the most receive it now and in the future.
