The Biden-Harris Administration has launched the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF), a $28.6 billion program to help restaurants, bars, food trucks, and other food and drink establishments that have suffered during the pandemic. Under the RRF, eligible businesses can receive grants equal to their pandemic-related revenue loss, with a cap of $10 million per business and $5 million per location. The funds can be used for expenses like payroll and rent. The SBA will prioritize funding applications from small businesses owned by women, veterans, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals for the first 21 days of the program. The administration has also set aside $9.5 billion for the smallest restaurants and bars. In addition to the RRF, the administration has approved PPP loans, COVID-19 EIDL, and Targeted EIDL Advance grants for restaurants and bars. While the industry has improved in recent months, many establishments are still struggling, and the administration aims to provide relief to help them stay open.
