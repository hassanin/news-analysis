The article discusses the history and significance of the federal holiday known as "Washington's Birthday," which is commonly referred to as "Presidents' Day." The holiday was established in 1879 to honor George Washington, the first president of the United States. It is celebrated on the third Monday of February, as mandated by a 1968 law that created several federal holidays on Mondays. Despite being called "Washington's Birthday," the holiday never falls on his actual birth date of February 22. In 1968, there was an attempt to change the name of the holiday to "Presidents' Day," but it was controversial and ultimately dropped. Many states adopted the name "Presidents' Day" instead of "Washington's Birthday." The article also mentions how past presidents have recognized the holiday, and how the Senate has a tradition of reading Washington's Farewell Address each year. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of remembering and celebrating George Washington's life and the values for which he stood.
