The Obama Administration has announced 14 initial partners in the Better Buildings Challenge, a part of the Better Buildings Initiative launched by President Obama to make America's commercial buildings 20% more efficient over the next decade. The initial partners include private sector companies, financial institutions, and local governments. The Better Buildings Challenge aims to support President Obama's goal of helping businesses save nearly $40 billion annually in energy costs. The partners will work with the Department of Energy to develop the details of the challenge and share their energy savings and efficiency strategies. Some of the commitments announced include retrofitting homes for military families, upgrading energy efficiency in commercial real estate, and providing financing for energy efficiency projects.
