The article announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Venezuela. The President issued Executive Order 13692 in 2015, declaring a national emergency due to various concerns, including human rights violations, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, violence in response to protests, and government corruption. Subsequent executive orders were issued to address the ongoing issues. The circumstances described in these orders have not improved and continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692 is being continued for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
