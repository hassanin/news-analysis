The Obama Administration has announced ground rules to govern the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), commonly known as drones, in the National Airspace System. These rules will enable the safe expansion of a new generation of aviation technologies that will create jobs, enhance public safety, and advance scientific inquiry. The Department of Transportation has published the final "Small UAS" rule, which provides guidelines for non-recreational operation of unmanned aircraft systems under 55 pounds. The rule allows drone flight for commercial, scientific, public, and educational purposes, subject to operational and safety requirements. The Administration believes that expanded use of drones must be done responsibly, with clear rules to protect safety and privacy. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will work with local and state governments, airports, pilots, and companies to ensure the safe implementation of the rule. The Administration has also taken steps to protect privacy, including instituting privacy policies for Federal agencies and developing industry-consensus best practices for privacy. The Administration is launching a public education campaign on privacy and calling for commitments from private sector and nonprofit organizations to protect privacy during drone operations. Additionally, Federal agencies are announcing steps to integrate unmanned aircraft systems into the National Airspace System and to deploy these systems for public safety, research, and environmental monitoring purposes.
