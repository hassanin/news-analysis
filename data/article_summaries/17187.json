White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer issued a statement emphasizing the need for a balanced approach in solving the country's fiscal problems. He stated that the burden of higher costs and budget cuts should not solely fall on the middle-class and seniors, but should also be shared by the wealthiest and special interests. Pfeiffer highlighted the progress made by both parties in budget negotiations and urged them not to back off. He emphasized the importance of rising above cynicism and demonstrating to the American people that the government can still achieve significant goals. Pfeiffer stated that the President will make this case to congressional leaders.
