The article discusses the establishment of the Presidential POWER Initiative by President Barack Obama. The initiative aims to protect workers and ensure reemployment by improving workplace safety and health. It sets aggressive performance targets for executive departments and agencies, such as reducing injury and illness rates, analyzing data on injuries, and increasing the timely filing of workers' compensation claims. The Secretary of Labor will lead the initiative and report on its progress annually. Each department and agency will bear its own costs for participation. The memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities. The Secretary of Labor is directed to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
