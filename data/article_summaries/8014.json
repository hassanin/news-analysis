The Biden Administration has recognized the challenges faced by private businesses in the supply chain as a result of the pandemic. The surge in e-commerce and disruptions caused by COVID-19 have led to delays and congestion in global supply chains. In response, the President launched the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to address transportation and logistics bottlenecks. The Administration is now convening business leaders, port leaders, and union leaders to discuss challenges and solutions. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which handle 40% of containers entering the US, are committing to 24/7 operations to speed up shipments. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union is also willing to work extra shifts. Large companies are announcing plans to utilize expanded hours to move cargo more efficiently. These commitments are expected to reduce congestion and unlock capacity in the transportation system. Secretary Buttigieg and Port Envoy Porcari will continue working with stakeholders to promote expanded hours and move towards 24/7 operations. This effort is part of the broader work of the Biden-Harris Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to address bottlenecks and support economic recovery.
