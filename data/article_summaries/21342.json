President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Arkansas and has ordered federal aid to support recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding occurred from March 8-13, 2016. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also be funded on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Charles Maskell has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
