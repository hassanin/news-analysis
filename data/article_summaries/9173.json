The U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability is a long-term initiative aimed at redefining how the United States prevents violence and advances stability in areas vulnerable to conflict. It is being implemented through 10-year plans developed in consultation with local stakeholders in priority partner countries and regions such as Haiti, Libya, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and Coastal West Africa countries. The U.S. government is investing resources, including through the Prevention and Stabilization Fund, to support these plans. The strategy focuses on four goals: prevention, stabilization, partnerships, and management, and aims to break the cycle of instability and promote peaceful and resilient nations. The plans involve an integrated approach that utilizes various tools across diplomatic, defense, and development programs. The strategy also emphasizes partnerships, analysis, and adaptive learning to address conflict drivers and support partner countries in building a more peaceful future. The U.S. government is engaging with key stakeholders, civil society, multilateral organizations, regional organizations, the private sector, and other countries engaged in addressing conflict drivers. The strategy represents a long-term commitment to building political and economic resilience in partner societies and making strategic investments in prevention to achieve lasting peace.
