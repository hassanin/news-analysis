President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama send warm wishes to those celebrating Hanukkah. They acknowledge the rare occurrence of Hanukkah falling on Thanksgiving and the term "Thanksgivukkah" that has been coined for this event. They emphasize the significance of both holidays and express gratitude for the fortunate timing and the miracles in history. The President highlights the sacrifices made by the Maccabees and the Pilgrims to practice their religions freely. He reminds everyone that the true miracle of Hanukkah was the oil that lasted for eight days instead of one. The President concludes by expressing his commitment to securing and making the most of the blessings of freedom, and looks forward to working together with the Jewish community to build a brighter future.
