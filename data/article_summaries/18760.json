President Obama will host the 2015 White House Tribal Nations Conference on November 5. The conference aims to provide leaders from the 567 federally recognized tribes with the opportunity to interact directly with high-level federal government officials and members of the White House Council on Native American Affairs. Each tribe will be invited to send one representative to the conference. This will be the seventh conference of its kind for the Obama Administration and is part of the President's commitment to strengthen the government-to-government relationship with Indian Country and improve the lives of American Indians and Alaska Natives, particularly focusing on increasing opportunities for Native youth. More information about the conference will be released at a later date.
