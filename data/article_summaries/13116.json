The article discusses the announcement made by President Obama regarding the recipients of tax credits for clean energy production. The Recovery Act included a tax credit program to stimulate investment and job creation in clean energy technology production. The program will provide a 30% tax credit for investments in 183 clean energy production plants in 43 states. The tax credits aim to develop high-quality production capacity in the United States to supply clean energy projects and support growth in American exports of clean energy products. The $2.3 billion in tax credits will be allocated through a competitive process based on criteria such as commercial viability, job creation, technological innovation, and potential for reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The program is expected to have a significant impact on employment and will be implemented in stages based on available funds. The article also mentions that due to the high interest in the program, the government is calling on Congress to provide an additional $5 billion to expand the program and support job creation in clean energy production.
