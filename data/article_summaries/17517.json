President Obama convened a meeting at FEMA Headquarters to receive an update on efforts to prepare communities for extreme weather events and other climate change impacts ahead of the 2014 hurricane season. The meeting focused on technology innovations and mobile applications developed by federal, state, and local agencies that will better inform and involve the public in preparedness and response activities. The President was briefed on NOAA's new storm surge map and the Department of Energy's "Lantern Live" app. Representatives from Virginia and Orange County, Florida also presented their mobile apps that assist residents before, during, and after emergency situations. The President thanked them for their initiative in developing these tools. The briefing also discussed the third National Climate Assessment, which confirms that climate change is affecting every region of the United States. The President expects his team to take all necessary steps to prepare for hurricanes, wildfires, and other catastrophes. Disaster preparedness is a shared responsibility, and the President urges the American people to talk with their families about emergencies and follow the direction of state and local officials.
