In this article, President Obama discusses the importance of expanding overtime pay to help increase wages for the middle class. He highlights that millions of Americans work more than 40 hours a week but do not receive overtime pay. The Department of Labor has finalized a rule to extend overtime protections to 4.2 million Americans, which will increase their wages by $12 billion over the next 10 years. Obama emphasizes that this action will not only improve the lives of American families but also strengthen the economy. He mentions a letter he received from a woman named Elizabeth Paredes, who works long hours without overtime pay, and emphasizes the need to update overtime regulations. The new rule will double the salary threshold for overtime eligibility, allowing more workers to qualify. Obama concludes by stating that this is a significant step towards increasing wages and ensuring that hard work is rewarded in America.
