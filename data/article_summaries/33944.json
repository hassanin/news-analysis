In this proclamation, President Donald Trump discusses the implementation of tariffs on steel imports into the United States. The Secretary of Commerce had previously investigated the effect of steel imports on national security, and it was determined that these imports threatened to impair national security. In March 2018, a 25 percent ad valorem tariff was imposed on steel imports from all countries except Canada and Mexico. However, countries with a security relationship with the United States were invited to discuss alternative ways to address the threat to national security. The United States has reached agreements with South Korea, Argentina, Australia, and Brazil on measures to address the threat posed by steel imports from these countries. As a result, South Korea is excluded from the tariff, while the temporary exemptions for Argentina, Australia, and Brazil are extended until details of alternative measures can be finalized. Discussions are ongoing with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. Unless satisfactory alternative means are reached, the tariff on steel imports from these countries will be effective from June 1, 2018. The proclamation also includes amendments to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States and other administrative details.
