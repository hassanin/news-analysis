The article discusses the impacts of the government shutdown on important research programs. It mentions that the federal government's research agencies have been largely closed, with scientists being sent home and projects being shelved. It highlights that four Nobel Prize-winning researchers who work for the federal government are currently furloughed and unable to conduct their research. 

The article provides specific examples of the impacts on certain research agencies. It states that two-thirds of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) personnel have been sent home, affecting activities such as influenza surveillance and monitoring during peak flu season. The CDC's flu vaccination campaigns have been cut back, and the weekly "Flu View" report relied upon by public-health authorities has been suspended. However, the CDC will still address any imminent threats to public health.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has furloughed 98 percent of its staff, resulting in a halt in issuing new scientific research grants. The National Institute for Health (NIH) has furloughed nearly three-quarters of its staff, leading to restrictions on new patient admissions to the NIH Clinical Center, although it will continue to monitor and adjust its admissions policy based on life and safety considerations.

Overall, the article highlights the negative impacts of the government shutdown on important research programs and the potential consequences for public health and scientific advancements.
