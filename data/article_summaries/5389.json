President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued a proclamation declaring that the actions of the Russian government in their war against Ukraine constitute a national emergency that threatens the international relations of the United States. In response, President Biden has authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to make and issue regulations to regulate the anchorage and movement of Russian-affiliated vessels. The proclamation prohibits Russian-affiliated vessels from entering United States ports, with some exceptions. These exceptions include vessels used in the transport of source material, special nuclear material, and nuclear byproduct material if there are no viable alternative sources of supply, and vessels requesting entry due to force majeure for humanitarian purposes. The proclamation defines "Russian-affiliated vessels" as vessels that are of Russian registry, owned by the Russian government or Russian entities, or operated by Russian companies or individuals. The prohibition is effective from 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 28, 2022, and has been transmitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
