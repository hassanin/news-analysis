The United States is providing approximately $180 million in humanitarian aid to help feed the people of South Sudan, who are facing the worst food security situation in the world. This funding includes a release from the Department of Agriculture's Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust and funds for the U.S. Agency for International Development. Since the crisis began, the United States has provided over $456 million in aid to South Sudan. The scale of the suffering and humanitarian need in the country is shocking, and there is a real threat of famine. The South Sudanese leaders, President Salva Kiir and Riek Machar, must prioritize the interests of their people and take immediate action to prevent further suffering. It is crucial for both sides to end the violence and ensure the safety of humanitarian aid workers so that they can reach those in need. The United States remains committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
