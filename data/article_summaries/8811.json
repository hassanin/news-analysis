Vice President Kamala Harris launched $60 million worth of new regional maritime initiatives during the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit in May 2022. These initiatives, led by the U.S. Coast Guard, aim to support maritime livelihoods, marine ecosystems, and sustainable development. As part of her commitment to upholding the rules-based international maritime order in the South China Sea, the Vice President visited Palawan, the Philippines, and engaged with the Philippines Coast Guard. She emphasized the importance of international law, unimpeded commerce, and freedom of the seas in protecting Philippine lives and livelihoods. Additionally, the Vice President aimed to strengthen maritime cooperation in Southeast Asia by expanding the United States' partnership with Philippine maritime law enforcement agencies, providing training, and building capacity.
