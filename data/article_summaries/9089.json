This article summarizes an executive order signed by President Joe Biden on January 25, 2021, titled "Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of America by All of America's Workers." The order aims to maximize the use of goods, products, materials, and services produced in the United States by implementing policies in federal financial assistance awards and federal procurements. The order emphasizes supporting American businesses and workers in strategic industries and promoting transparency and accountability in procurement. It establishes the Made in America Office within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and requires agencies to provide detailed justifications for waivers of "Made in America Laws" to the Made in America Director. The order also calls for the development of a public website to provide information on proposed waivers and their status, promotes supplier scouting with the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership, and seeks to enforce the Buy American Act of 1933. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council is tasked with proposing amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to increase domestic content requirements and price preferences for domestically produced goods. The order also requires reports on agency compliance with Made in America Laws and recommendations for further implementation. Additionally, it revokes previous executive orders and provides general provisions for implementation.
