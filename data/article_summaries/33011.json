President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed April 2018 as National Fair Housing Month in the United States. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, which was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson just days after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, color, religion, or national origin. Over the past 50 years, progress has been made in ensuring fair and affordable housing for all Americans. The Congress has expanded the law's protections to include discrimination based on sex, disabilities, and families with children. The Trump Administration is committed to enhancing the development of affordable housing options, promoting equal access to opportunity, and creating more vibrant communities. The President urges all Americans to learn more about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act and to support homeownership for all, regardless of background.
