In a statement, National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice condemns North Korea's recent missile launch, which follows closely after its nuclear test in January. She states that these actions are destabilizing and provocative, as well as a violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions. Rice emphasizes that North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs pose serious threats to the interests and security of the United States and its allies. She criticizes North Korea for prioritizing these programs over the well-being of its people and diverting resources away from their needs. The United States is committed to the security of its allies in the region and will take necessary steps to defend itself and respond to North Korean provocations. Rice calls on the international community to unite and show North Korea that there will be serious consequences for its reckless actions.
