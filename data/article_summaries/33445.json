The article discusses the reasons behind the imposition of metal tariffs by the US government. According to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the tariffs were imposed because steel and aluminum imports have caused significant damage to the domestic industry, leading to job losses and threatening national security. Unfair trading practices, particularly from China, have distorted global steel and aluminum markets. The tariffs aim to reverse this situation by allowing companies to reopen mills, expand operations, attract new workers, and maintain critical steel- and aluminum-making skills. The US government believes that other countries should take responsibility for their unfair practices and work together to address the underlying problems facing these industries.
