President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Georgia due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from April 27-28, 2011. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The affected counties include Bartow, Catoosa, Dade, Floyd, Polk, Spalding, and Walker. Assistance for individuals can include grants for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. Federal funding is also available for debris removal and emergency protective measures on a cost-sharing basis for certain counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Gracia B. Szczech has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated in the future. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. FEMA can be contacted for further information.
