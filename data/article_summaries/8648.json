Vice President Kamala Harris and Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei will meet virtually on April 26 to discuss immediate relief needs for the Guatemalan people and deepen cooperation on migration. The following day, the Vice President will participate in a virtual roundtable with representatives from Guatemalan community-based organizations. They will emphasize the importance of involving the Guatemalan people in finding solutions to the root causes of migration.
