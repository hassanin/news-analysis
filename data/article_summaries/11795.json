The United States strongly condemns President Yahya Jammeh of The Gambia's decision to nullify the December 1 election, ignoring the will of the Gambian people. The US urges President Jammeh to retract his call for a new vote and facilitate a peaceful transition to President-elect Adama Barrow. They call on all Gambians to reject violence and seek a peaceful resolution that upholds the will of the people. The US also urges The Gambia's security services to protect all Gambians and not suppress peaceful expressions of dissent. They will work with international partners to ensure accountability for anyone who uses violence to undermine the democratic transition in The Gambia.
