President Donald J. Trump is taking action to improve the standards for exporting Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). The current standards set by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) are outdated and give an unfair advantage to countries outside of the MTCR. These outdated standards also hinder the deterrence capability of the United States abroad. Despite two years of discussion with MTCR partners, no consensus was reached on reforming the standards. As a result, the President has decided to treat a specific subset of MTCR Category I UAS as Category II, allowing for their export. This action is consistent with MTCR Guidelines and the UAS Export Policy and will improve national security and economic security for the United States. The United States will continue to review UAS exports based on rigorous criteria and considerations of national security, nonproliferation, foreign policy objectives, and the responsible use of technology by purchasing countries. The United States hopes that other MTCR nations will adopt this new standard.
