On March 14, 2012, the President signed two bills into law. The first is S. 1134, known as the "St. Croix River Crossing Project Authorization Act," which authorizes the St. Croix River Crossing Project and includes mitigation measures as enforceable conditions for the project. The second is S. 1710, which designates the United States courthouse in Anchorage, Alaska, as the James M. Fitzgerald United States Courthouse.
