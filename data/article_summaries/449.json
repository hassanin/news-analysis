Ahead of Equal Pay Day 2023, the White House convened state legislators who have been at the forefront of advancing equal pay. President Biden has taken executive action to address the gender wage gap, such as promoting pay equity and transparency for federal workers and contractors. He also supports the Paycheck Fairness Act, which aims to strengthen equal pay protections and combat discriminatory pay practices. Several states have enacted salary range transparency laws, requiring employers to disclose salary ranges to job applicants. Additionally, some states have banned the use of prior salary history in setting pay. The White House thanked the legislators for their efforts and expressed support in the fight for equal pay.
