Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy Council, and Danielle Carnival, Coordinator of the White House Cancer Moonshot, led a discussion on combatting cervical cancer through immunizations, screening, and treatment. The meeting included medical experts, researchers, patient advocates, and representatives from various organizations. The participants emphasized the need to expand access to immunizations, increase screening rates, and address disparities in screening and treatment. Recommendations included strengthening the healthcare workforce, improving screening tests, and raising awareness about vaccination and screening. The impact of vaccines in reducing cervical cancer incidence was highlighted, along with the importance of innovation and continued investments in research. The Biden-Harris Administration is working to address these challenges through the Cancer Moonshot initiative and by expanding access to affordable health insurance that covers preventive services. Participants praised the Administration's efforts to combat cervical cancer and increase access to prevention and screening.
