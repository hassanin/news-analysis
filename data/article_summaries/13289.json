President Barack Obama will award the Medal of Honor to Army Sergeant William Shemin and Army Private Henry Johnson for their bravery during World War I. Sergeant Shemin will receive the medal posthumously for his actions in France in August 1918, where he repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire to rescue wounded soldiers. Private Johnson will also receive the medal posthumously for his actions in France in May 1918, where he bravely retaliated against a German raiding party and prevented a fellow soldier from being taken prisoner. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who display extraordinary bravery and self-sacrifice in combat.
