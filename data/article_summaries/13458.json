Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland expressed his support for President Obama's compromise with Congressional leaders regarding a middle-class tax cut framework. He commended the President for prioritizing the well-being of millions of unemployed Americans, who were at risk of losing crucial financial support due to House Republicans' focus on securing tax cuts for millionaires. While O'Malley acknowledged that the deal was not perfect, he applauded the President's commitment to families affected by the lasting effects of the Bush recession, particularly during the holiday season. The Governor criticized Republican leaders in Congress for prioritizing the short-term financial interests of millionaires over the immediate needs of unemployed American families and the long-term fiscal health of the nation.
