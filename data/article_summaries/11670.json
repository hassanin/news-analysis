Gerald W. McEntee, President of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), responded to President Obama's speech on fiscal responsibility by emphasizing the need for everyone to sacrifice to lower the federal debt. He argued that there is a revenue problem, not a spending problem, and urged lawmakers to create jobs, close corporate tax loopholes, and ensure that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share. McEntee also praised the President for rejecting the Republican budget proposal to turn Medicare into a voucher and block grant Medicaid.
