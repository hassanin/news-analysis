President Biden has announced his intent to nominate Shalanda Young as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Nani Coloretti as the Deputy Director. If confirmed, Young would be the first Black woman to lead the OMB, and Coloretti would be one of the highest-ranking Asian American, Native Hawaiians, or Pacific Islanders serving in the government. Young currently serves as the Acting Director of the OMB and previously worked as the Clerk and Staff Director for the House Appropriations Committee. Coloretti has held various positions in public, private, and non-profit organizations, including deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Assistant Secretary for Management and Acting CFO of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. She is currently a Senior Vice President at the Urban Institute. Both Young and Coloretti have been confirmed by the Senate in the past.
