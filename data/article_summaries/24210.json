In a letter to the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, as well as the chairmen and ranking members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, President Barack Obama announces his determination to suspend the right to bring an action under title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996. This suspension, lasting for 6 months beyond February 1, 2012, is deemed necessary for the national interests of the United States and to expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba.
