Nasir al-Wahishi, the leader of al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), has been killed in Yemen, according to the Intelligence Community. This is a major blow to AQAP and al-Qa’ida as a whole. Wahishi was responsible for planning attacks against the United States, U.S. interests in the Arabian Peninsula, and allies in the region. He was also responsible for the deaths of innocent Yemenis and Westerners, including Americans. The death of Wahishi is a step towards degrading and defeating these terrorist groups, although they will continue to pose a threat. The President has made it clear that terrorists who threaten the United States will not find safe haven anywhere.
