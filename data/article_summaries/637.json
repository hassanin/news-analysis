One year ago, President Biden signed an Executive Order (EO 14074) on Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety. The EO aimed to make federal policing more effective and accountable by implementing various measures such as banning chokeholds, mandating body-worn cameras, and implementing stronger use-of-force policies. The EO also directed federal agencies to provide guidance, technical assistance, and grant support to state, Tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) law enforcement agencies to adopt similar reforms.

Since then, federal agencies have made significant progress in implementing the requirements of the EO. They have engaged with stakeholders, including law enforcement associations, civil rights groups, and families impacted by police violence, throughout the process. The Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to fully implementing the EO and strengthening public trust and safety.

The Executive Order has led to concrete actions to increase law enforcement accountability, raise standards for federal law enforcement agencies, support STLT law enforcement through guidance and grant support, improve conditions for incarcerated individuals, and strengthen data collection and analysis.

The Administration continues to call for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to further advance accountability, transparency, and public trust in law enforcement. Congressional action is necessary for real change at the state and local level.
