The White House has released 51 state and territory fact sheets on the 13th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) becoming law. These fact sheets highlight how the plans of extreme MAGA House Republicans to repeal the ACA and cut Medicaid will negatively impact working families. The fact sheets show that these proposals will raise premiums and healthcare costs, threaten coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions, reduce protections against high medical bills, and increase waitlists for quality care for seniors and people with disabilities. Since its implementation in 2010, the ACA has helped 40.2 million Americans gain access to affordable healthcare, lowered costs for families, and provided coverage for services like cancer detection and mental health treatment. President Joe Biden has continued to build on the progress made under the ACA by reducing healthcare prices, expanding insurance coverage, and capping out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare.
