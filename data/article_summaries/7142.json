The Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, addressed a group of leaders in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, regarding the importance of protecting women's rights and reproductive freedom. She emphasized that the recent actions of the Supreme Court in restricting these rights are deeply harmful to the nation. Harris highlighted the need for the government to respect a woman's right to make decisions about her own body and life, without imposing its beliefs upon her. She also expressed concern over states passing laws that criminalize healthcare providers and deny exceptions for rape or incest. Harris, along with members of Congress, vowed to push for national legislation to codify the protections provided by Roe v. Wade. Additionally, she acknowledged the efforts of local leaders in Pennsylvania who are fighting to defend these fundamental rights. The Vice President concluded by thanking the press and initiating a discussion with the leaders present.
