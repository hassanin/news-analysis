Second Lady Karen Pence visited the Tracy's Kids Art Therapy program at Methodist Children's Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. She toured the Pediatric Oncology unit and observed an art therapy session with young patients. Pence also participated in a roundtable discussion with the hospital's leadership and staff to learn more about the program. Pence first became aware of art therapy over 10 years ago and joined the board of Tracy's Kids in 2011. The art therapy program exists in seven locations in the United States and provides young patients with the opportunity to work with an art therapist to cope with the emotional stress and trauma of cancer and its treatment. Pence praised the positive difference art therapy is making in these children's lives. Methodist Children's Hospital believes in a holistic approach to healing, and programs like Tracy's Kids are valuable in promoting patients' mental and spiritual well-being. The CEO of Methodist Children's Hospital expressed gratitude for Pence's visit and support. Pence's chosen initiative is art therapy, which she calls "Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART." Art therapy is an integrative mental health and human services profession that enriches lives through active art-making and creative processes within a psychotherapeutic relationship. Professional art therapists facilitate art therapy, utilizing psychological and counseling theories and techniques.
