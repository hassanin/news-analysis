This article is a notice from the White House announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Cuba. The national emergency was initially declared in 1996 due to the Cuban government's destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft. The emergency was extended in 2004 to deny support to the Cuban government. The Cuban government has not shown that it will refrain from using excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft engaged in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. The unauthorized entry of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is also seen as detrimental to U.S. foreign policy. As a result, the national emergency and the authority to regulate the anchorage and movement of vessels are being continued. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
