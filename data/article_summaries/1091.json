In her speech at the White House for an Art in Embassies event, the First Lady emphasized the power of art to connect people and promote diplomacy. She recognized the State Department's efforts in distributing art to American embassies and sending artists as cultural envoys. The First Lady also highlighted the works of the five medalists, which hang in embassies around the world, and praised their efforts in forging connections between themselves and local communities. She mentioned a recent exhibition in Lisbon featuring a retelling of Norman Rockwell's "Four Freedoms," created by one of the medalists, Hank Willis Thomas. The First Lady emphasized how art can weave together history, understanding, and fellowship, crossing cultural and language barriers. She thanked all the recipients for their contributions to a brighter and more beautiful world. The speech concluded with an introduction of Deputy Secretary of State Richard Verma.
