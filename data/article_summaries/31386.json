The House Committee on Foreign Affairs is set to hold a hearing on the "Financing Overseas Development: The Administration's Proposal." The Administration supports the goals of the BUILD Act of 2018, which aims to consolidate the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and certain aid programs into a reformed Development Finance Institution (DFI) that promotes private sector development in less developed countries. The current U.S. development finance tools are outdated and fragmented, hindering the achievement of foreign policy and national security objectives. The reform will encourage market-based solutions and help the U.S. compete in strategic competition. The legislation aligns with President Trump's commitment to reform development finance institutions and is consistent with the National Security Strategy and the Fiscal Year 2019 Budget Request. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to strengthen the bills to align with national interests and enhance institutional links with USAID and other development agencies. The bills should also include a revised funding structure and risk management reforms.
