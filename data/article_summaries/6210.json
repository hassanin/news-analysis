President Biden and leaders from 13 other APEC economies announced progress on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) during a three-hour meeting. The IPEF aims to generate more growth and opportunity in the region, particularly in dealing with climate change. Consensus has been reached on three pillars of the IPEF: a supply chain agreement to identify bottlenecks, an agreement to accelerate the clean energy transition, and an agreement to combat corruption and improve tax administration. The United States is also launching the Investment Accelerator, which aims to bring private capital for major investments in clean energy and high technology. The goal is to mobilize private investment and drive nations in the Indo-Pacific to the top in standards, transparency, inclusivity, and innovation. Other nations are welcome to join the partnership.
