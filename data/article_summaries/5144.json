White House spokesperson Ian Sams held a teleconference call with reporters to discuss the ongoing investigation into classified documents found in President Biden's possession. Sams emphasized that the President and his team have been fully cooperating with the investigation, directing his personal lawyers to ensure that any materials were returned to the government. He also highlighted the importance of restoring the independence of the Justice Department and handling the investigation in the right way. Sams criticized elected Republicans for engaging in political stunts and fake outrage, pointing out their previous defense of the former President's handling of classified information. He stated that the White House intends to provide as much information as possible to the public, but is limited by the ongoing DOJ review. Sams also addressed questions about the timing of disclosures and the White House's interaction with Congress, stating that they will review and respond to oversight inquiries in good faith. He emphasized the need to strike a balance between transparency and respecting the integrity of the investigation. Sams declined to provide specific details about the documents or the ongoing investigation, deferring to the Department of Justice. He concluded the call by inviting Republicans in Congress to join the administration in addressing the important issues facing American families.
