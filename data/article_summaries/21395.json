On June 22, 2009, President Obama signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which granted authority over tobacco products to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The key elements of this legislation included the creation of a new Center for Tobacco Products at the FDA to regulate tobacco products, the banning of candy-flavored cigarettes, the requirement for tobacco manufacturers to disclose information about ingredients and additives in tobacco products, and the implementation of measures to reduce youth-focused marketing and misleading marketing practices. The act also provided the FDA with regulatory authority to regulate marketing and promotion of tobacco products and set performance standards for tobacco products. The bill signing event was attended by various government officials, members of Congress, administration officials, and representatives from advocacy organizations.
