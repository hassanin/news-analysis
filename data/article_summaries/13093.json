The President has made a determination required under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 regarding the supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. The Energy Information Administration's report shows that global oil consumption has exceeded production in recent months, but this is in line with seasonal patterns. International oil supply disruptions have been offset by increased oil production from other countries, particularly the United States and Saudi Arabia. Although Saudi Arabia's increased output has reduced spare crude production capacity, stable inventory levels and oil prices indicate a well-supplied international crude market compared to a year ago. There is currently enough non-Iranian oil supply to allow foreign countries to significantly reduce their purchases of Iranian oil. Many purchasers of Iranian crude oil have already reduced or stopped their purchases.
