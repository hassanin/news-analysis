The Department of Defense (DOD) is assisting the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in transporting Nestl√© S.A. formula from Zurich, Switzerland to Plainfield, Indiana. This is part of Operation Fly Formula, a program launched by President Biden to expedite the import of infant formula. The formula being transported includes three types that are hypoallergenic and in short supply due to the closure of the Abbott Sturgis plant. The shipments will be done using commercial aircraft contracted by the DOD. President Biden has also taken other steps, such as invoking the Defense Production Act and reopening the Abbott Nutrition facility, to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for families.
