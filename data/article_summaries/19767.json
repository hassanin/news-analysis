President Barack Obama has signed into law H.R. 3962, the "Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010." This law prevents a 21.3 percent reduction in the Medicare physician fee schedule and replaces it with a 2.2 percent increase until November 2010. The President has requested the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take immediate steps to minimize disruption to Medicare physicians and beneficiaries. These steps include implementing the legislative update to the physician fee schedule, providing resources to ensure a rapid implementation, reprocessing claims reflecting the fee schedule reduction, protecting beneficiaries from any service disruptions, and reopening the 2010 Annual Participation Enrollment Program for physicians and providers to participate in Medicare. This memorandum does not create any legally enforceable rights.
