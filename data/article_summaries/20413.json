President Obama had a call with nearly 150 business leaders to discuss the ongoing government shutdown and efforts to avoid a default. He thanked them for their engagement and updated them on his conversations with Congressional caucuses. The President emphasized the importance of reopening the government and removing the threat of default before engaging in long-term budget discussions. He expressed the need for a budget that invests in national priorities, grows the economy, and establishes a sustainable fiscal path without using the threat of default as a negotiating tactic.
