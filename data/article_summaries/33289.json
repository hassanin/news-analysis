President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order regarding Venezuela, taking additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in previous Executive Orders. The order prohibits transactions related to the purchase of any debt owed to the Government of Venezuela, including accounts receivable. It also prohibits the sale, transfer, assignment, or pledging as collateral by the Government of Venezuela of any equity interest in any entity in which the government has a 50 percent or greater ownership interest. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, has been authorized to take necessary actions to carry out the purposes of the Executive Order.
