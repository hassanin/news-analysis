Selection is highly competitive and based on professional achievement, leadership potential, and commitment to public service. The Fellows will contribute meaningfully at senior levels of the federal government and have the opportunity to foster leadership in various fields, including government, business, law, media, medicine, education, diplomacy, and the military.
