On April 5, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation to honor the memory of John Glenn. The proclamation orders that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff at the White House, public buildings and grounds, military posts and naval stations, and naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions on the day of Glenn's interment until sunset. The proclamation also directs that the flag be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
