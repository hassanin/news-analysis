First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden have written an op-ed in MilitaryTimes.com to announce commitments and pledges made by philanthropies across the country to support veterans and military families. They highlight the challenges that military families face even after the joyous homecoming moments, such as finding employment, dealing with mental and physical challenges, and adjusting to new homes and schools. With the war in Afghanistan coming to an end, the focus on military families may decrease, but the authors emphasize the importance of continued support. They announce the creation of the Veterans Philanthropy Exchange, a national funding structure to support military families, with philanthropies committing $102 million in new funding over the next five years. The op-ed serves as a call to action for all Americans to honor and support military families and create a permanent network of love and support for them.
