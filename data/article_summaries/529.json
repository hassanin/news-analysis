The article highlights the issue of Black maternal mortality and morbidity in the United States. It states that the maternal mortality rates in the country are among the highest in the developed world, with Black mothers being affected at a much higher rate than white, Hispanic, Asian American, and Pacific Islander women. This disparity exists regardless of income or education levels.

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to addressing these disparities and building a healthcare system that delivers equity and dignity to Black, Indigenous, and other women and girls of color. Both Vice President Harris and President Biden have been advocates for Black maternal health throughout their careers. Vice President Harris introduced legislation to improve access to quality maternal care and educate providers about implicit bias, while President Biden fought for the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion to support maternal health.

The article emphasizes that healthcare is a right, not a privilege, and that everyone should have equitable access to healthcare before, during, and after pregnancy. It calls for systemic policies that provide comprehensive and holistic maternal health care free from bias and discrimination. Additionally, it highlights the need to address unequal social determinants of health, such as nutrition, housing, paid leave, and workplace discrimination.

The United States is urged to address systemic barriers, improve data collection, and invest in community-based organizations to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the healthcare system. April 11-17, 2021, is proclaimed as Black Maternal Health Week, calling upon all Americans to raise awareness and commit to creating a world where Black women do not have to fear for their safety, well-being, dignity, and lives during and after pregnancy.
