The article discusses Presidential Determination No. 2022-16, which is a memorandum from President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the Secretary of Energy regarding insulation. The determination states that insulation is an essential resource for the national defense and the clean energy economy. Without Presidential action, the United States industry would not be able to provide sufficient insulation in a timely manner. Therefore, the President has determined that purchases, purchase commitments, or other action under the Defense Production Act are the most effective and practical way to meet the need for insulation. The President also finds that expanding domestic production capability for insulation is necessary to avoid a shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability. As a result, the President waives certain requirements of the Act for the purpose of expanding domestic production capability for insulation. The determination is authorized to be published in the Federal Register.
