NATO leaders met to show their support for Ukraine and condemn Russia's invasion. They heard directly from President Zelenskyy and pledged to provide significant security assistance to Ukraine. The United States has announced $1 billion in new security assistance, including anti-aircraft systems, anti-armor weapons, drones, and ammunition. Other Allies are also providing defensive support. The leaders discussed strengthening NATO's collective defense, particularly on the Eastern flank. They activated NATO's defensive plans and deployed additional forces to Europe. Four new battle groups were established in Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Plans for additional forces and capabilities will be developed before the NATO summit in June, along with an updated Strategic Concept to address the new security environment.
