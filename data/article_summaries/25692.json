The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to implement a policy that makes it harder for migrants to qualify for asylum in the U.S. The decision is seen as a victory for President Trump, as well as for the American people and the rule of law. The policy requires migrants to claim asylum in the first safe country they enter, rather than being able to choose the U.S. based on better economic opportunities. The author argues that this decision will help reduce illegal immigration and praises President Trump for his determination in enforcing immigration laws. The author believes that the American people will judge President Trump based on his record of accomplishments and his love for the United States.
