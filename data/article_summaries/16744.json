During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney states that President Obama is still reviewing options for a response to the Syrian chemical weapons attack. Carney also mentions that the intelligence community is working on an assessment of the attack and that the evidence will be provided to the public in the coming days. He emphasizes that there is no doubt that chemical weapons were used in Syria and that the Syrian regime is responsible. Carney also mentions that the President is consulting with international allies and members of Congress. He states that the goal of the response is to uphold the international norm against the use of chemical weapons and to deter further use. Carney does not provide specific details about the response options being considered, but he mentions that the President does not envision a situation in Syria that would lead to U.S. boots on the ground and that regime change is not the focus. Carney also addresses questions about the legality of any potential military action and the role of the United Nations in the decision-making process.
