President Trump signed an executive order to launch the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. The council's goal is to coordinate efforts across the federal government to deliver jobs, investment, and growth to low-income and impoverished communities. The council will focus on Opportunity Zones, which are areas designated for tax incentives to attract private sector investment. The Treasury Department estimates that these incentives could attract over $100 billion in private investment. The council will be led by Secretary Ben Carson and include other government officials and stakeholders. The president and other speakers at the event emphasized the administration's commitment to uplifting all Americans and creating economic opportunities for all.
