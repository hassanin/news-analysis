The article discusses the Obama administration's plan to reform international tax laws and crack down on tax havens. The administration aims to create a level playing field for companies investing in the US by removing tax advantages for investing overseas and providing incentives to create jobs at home. The plan includes reforming deferral rules, closing foreign tax credit loopholes, and making the tax credit for research and experimentation permanent. The administration also proposes getting tough on tax havens by eliminating loopholes for offshore subsidiaries, cracking down on the abuse of tax havens by individuals, and increasing IRS enforcement. These measures are expected to raise $210 billion over the next 10 years. The administration hopes to pass bipartisan legislation based on proposals from key leaders in Congress.
