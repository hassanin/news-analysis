President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Louisiana due to the impact of Hurricane Delta from October 6 to October 10, 2020. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The parishes of Acadia, Calcasieu, Cameron, Jefferson Davis, and Vermilion are eligible for federal funding, which can include grants for temporary housing, home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to assist individuals and business owners. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. John E. Long has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional parishes and forms of assistance may be designated as assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated parishes can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.
