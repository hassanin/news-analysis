President Trump signed an executive order directing the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs to develop a joint action plan for improving mental health services for veterans. The plan aims to ensure that every veteran who needs mental health and suicide prevention services will receive them immediately upon their separation from military service. The executive order also provides mental health coverage for 12 months for all separating military members transitioning into civilian life. Currently, only 40 percent of these servicemembers have coverage in the VA for mental health services. The order is a response to the high suicide rate among veterans, with 20 veterans taking their own lives each day. Secretary Shulkin praised the executive order, stating that it is an unprecedented action that will help prevent veteran suicide.
