President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act," also known as the "SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act." The Act aims to address the opioid crisis by reducing the supply of and access to opioids, as well as expanding access to prevention, treatment, and recovery services. However, the Act raises several constitutional concerns for the President. Certain provisions of the Act revive and restore the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998, which require congressional approval for executive action taken after the bill's enactment and expand the role of Congress in the execution of laws. The President's administration will consider these provisions while respecting the constitutional separation of powers. Additionally, there are provisions that purport to require consultation with foreign officials and mandate or regulate the submission of information protected by executive privilege. The President's administration will handle these provisions in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs and withhold information when necessary. Lastly, there are provisions that interfere with the President's authority to recommend legislation by requiring legislative recommendations or mandating budget submissions that meet certain criteria. The President's administration will treat these provisions respectfully and in accordance with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, which grants the President the exclusive authority to recommend necessary and expedient measures to Congress.
