President Barack Obama granted clemency to twenty individuals, consisting of eight commutations and twelve pardons. The commutations included individuals convicted of offenses such as conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, possession with intent to distribute heroin and cocaine base, and possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute cocaine base. The President commuted their prison sentences, allowing them to be released earlier than originally sentenced. The pardons included individuals convicted of offenses such as possession of an unregistered distilling apparatus, counterfeiting Federal Reserve notes, and filing a false tax return. The President granted them forgiveness for their crimes, removing the legal consequences of their convictions.
