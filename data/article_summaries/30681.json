The report also mentions ongoing military operations against al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and associated forces, as well as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). US forces remain in Afghanistan to prevent the reemergence of safe havens for terrorists and support the Afghan government and military in their fight against the Taliban. In Iraq and Syria, US forces are conducting airstrikes and other operations against ISIS and al-Qa'ida. The report also mentions US military presence in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Somalia, Kenya, Niger, Cuba, the Philippines, Egypt, and Kosovo.
