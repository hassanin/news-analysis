On June 25, 2018, the President signed two laws related to veterans. The first law, called the "Whistleblower Protection Coordination Act," reauthorizes and renames the position of the Whistleblower Ombudsman to be the Whistleblower Protection Coordinator. The second law, called S. 2246, designates the health care center of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Tallahassee, Florida, as the Sergeant Ernest I. "Boots" Thomas VA Clinic.
