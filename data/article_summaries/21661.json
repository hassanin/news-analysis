The President participated in a conference call with utility executives to discuss the restoration of power to the millions of Americans affected by Hurricane Sandy. He thanked the executives for their efforts in prepositioning assets and commended the work of lineman and utility workers in repairing power lines. The President directed agencies to eliminate any bureaucratic roadblocks that could delay the power restoration effort and identified steps that could be taken to speed up the process, including the deployment of an industry liaison to FEMA's National Response Coordination Center. The President also requested regular updates on the progress made by the utilities.
