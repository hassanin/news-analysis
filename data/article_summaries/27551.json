First Lady Melania Trump visited the Cabell-Huntington Health Department in West Virginia to highlight the local community's efforts to combat the opioid crisis. She spoke with key leaders from the federal, state, and local level, including Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan, Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia, and various other officials. Mrs. Trump also met with a small group of women who shared personal stories about how the opioid epidemic has affected them and the positive impact their local community had on their lives. The First Lady has been actively promoting available resources to help families affected by the opioid epidemic through her BE BEST initiative. Before leaving West Virginia, she made an off-the-record stop at Ritter Park to pay respect and view the flags symbolizing children in the foster care system due to the opioid epidemic.
