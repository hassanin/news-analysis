The Biden-Harris Administration has announced that 61 of the largest hospital and health sector companies in the US have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030. These commitments include plans to strengthen resilience to climate change, protect public health, and lower costs. The health care sector accounts for 8.5% of US emissions, so these commitments align with President Biden's goal to reduce nationwide greenhouse gas emissions. The Biden-Harris Administration sees action on climate change as a public health priority due to its impact on severe weather, extreme heat, and food and water security. Over 650 private and public hospitals and health centers, along with pharmaceutical companies and medical device-makers, have signed the Health Sector Climate Pledge. The White House and the Department of Health and Human Services are reopening the pledge to build on these commitments ahead of the United Nations Climate Conference. The administration has also established the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity at HHS and invested in programs to help low-income Americans manage energy costs. The VA has made progress in implementing its Climate Action Plan, including incorporating climate resilience requirements into construction standards. The administration is also providing resources to support the health sector in transitioning to clean energy and reducing emissions. Private health care systems are also taking action on climate resilience.
