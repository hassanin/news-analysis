In this article, President Obama sends letters to bipartisan leaders regarding the NAB fund. He proposes expanding the fund from $50 billion to $550 billion, with the US participation being up to $100 billion. The president emphasizes that this participation does not represent a budgetary expenditure or an increase in the deficit, as it effectively involves an exchange of assets. The letters also request an enlargement of NAB membership to include increased participation from major emerging market countries. The article provides links to the letters sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Minority Leader John Boehner.
