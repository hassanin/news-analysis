In recognition of National Donate Life Month, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. expresses gratitude to the families and friends of organ donors, healthcare professionals, and the American people for their support in saving lives through organ, eye, tissue, marrow, and blood donations. Last year, the United States witnessed a record number of organ transplants, with deceased donor organ donations reaching an annual record for the 11th consecutive year. However, there continues to be a critical shortage of organ donors, with 17 people dying every day while waiting for a transplant. National Donate Life Month also highlights National Pediatric Transplant Week, aimed at addressing the pediatric transplant waiting list. Additionally, efforts are being made to promote greater diversity in organ donation and advance health equity for underserved communities. The article also emphasizes the importance of blood stem cell donors, as many individuals diagnosed with life-threatening blood cancers or diseases rely on donors outside of their families. While transplantation has made significant progress, there is still a need to shorten the waiting list and encourage more people to become organ donors. President Biden calls upon every eligible person to consider becoming an organ, eye, tissue, marrow, or blood donor and provides resources for those interested in registering.
