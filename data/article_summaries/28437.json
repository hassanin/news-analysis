President Trump has signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the Supreme Leader of Iran and the Office of the Supreme Leader, as well as others closely affiliated with them. This action comes in response to recent aggressive behaviors by the Iranian regime, including the shooting down of a U.S. drone and attacks on tankers. The goal of these sanctions is to deny the Supreme Leader and his office access to key financial resources and support. The President stated that these measures represent a strong and proportionate response to Iran's provocative actions and that pressure will continue to be increased until Iran abandons its dangerous activities. The President also emphasized that the U.S. does not seek conflict with Iran or any other country, but cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon and continue sponsoring terrorism. He expressed hope for a future negotiation with Iran if they are willing, and highlighted that the people of Iran are great people who deserve a better future. The President also mentioned his friendly relationship with North Korea and his belief in their and Iran's potential for a great future.
