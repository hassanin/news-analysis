Yesterday, Jennifer Klein, Catherine Powell, and Rosie Hidalgo from the Biden-Harris Administration met with stalking survivors to listen to their experiences and recommendations for supporting survivors of gender-based violence. The meeting took place during National Stalking Awareness Month, which was established in memory of Peggy Klinke, who was murdered twenty years ago. Stalking affects one in three women and one in six men in their lifetimes, and it can occur both online and offline. Stalking can have significant negative impacts on victims' lives, including their physical and mental health. The meeting participants discussed the Administration's commitment to addressing gender-based violence and stalking, including through the implementation of the first U.S. National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence and the work of the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse. The leaders of the Biden-Harris Administration acknowledged the important role of survivors and advocates in the anti-stalking field. The meeting focused on current needs in the anti-stalking field and strategies to improve support for stalking survivors, such as increasing access to training, resources, justice, and safety.
