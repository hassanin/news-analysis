The United States supports the appointment of a Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran by the United Nations Human Rights Council. This decision highlights the global concern over the poor state of human rights in Iran. The Iranian government is committing various abuses against its citizens, regardless of age, gender, faith, or profession. The Special Rapporteur will monitor and draw attention to these abuses. The United States will continue to advocate for the rights of Iranians fighting for their universal rights.
