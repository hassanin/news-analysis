The article discusses how the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has effectively split the individual insurance market in the United States. One group of Americans, about 8 million enrollees, receive taxpayer subsidies to help pay for their health insurance, while another group of about 5 million Americans pay the full premium without any subsidies. Additionally, 28 million Americans remain uninsured due to high costs. The Trump administration has expanded the availability of short-term, limited-duration insurance plans, which are not subject to Obamacare regulations and can cost 50-80% less. These plans can be a good option for Americans who cannot afford Obamacare coverage, such as small-business owners and independent contractors. The article argues that expanding these affordable options will provide more choices for consumers and improve health-care competition.
