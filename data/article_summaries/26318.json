President Trump visited Louisiana to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Laura, which made landfall as a Category 4 storm. Trump met with Governor John Bel Edwards, Senator John Kennedy, and other officials to discuss the response and recovery efforts. The President praised the resilience of the people of Louisiana and promised federal assistance in rebuilding. FEMA has already delivered water and meals to the affected areas, and power restoration is a priority. The EPA is monitoring air quality in the region, and the National Guard will resume COVID-19 testing on Monday. Trump also urged residents to register for federal assistance by calling 1-800-621-3362 or visiting DisasterAssistance.gov.
