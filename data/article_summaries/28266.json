On October 27, a senior Trump Administration delegation visited the Navajo Nation in Arizona. The visit was part of President Trump's policy agenda for Native American communities, called "Putting America's First Peoples First: Forgotten No More." The agenda focuses on respecting tribal sovereignty, promoting safe communities, improving infrastructure and the economy, honoring Native American heritage, and improving education and healthcare. The delegation discussed various issues with Navajo leaders, including infrastructure, health, veterans' affairs, economic development, and the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous relatives. The delegation also presented Navajo leaders with the "2020 Presidential Award for Extraordinary Efforts to Combat Trafficking in Persons" for their leadership in combating human trafficking on tribal lands. The delegation participated in working sessions and formal government-to-government discussions to identify opportunities for partnership to achieve the goals of the President's plan. The delegation also visited cultural and economic development sites near Window Rock. On October 28, the delegation attended the opening of the Navajo Nation's Little Singer Community School, which received over $27 million in federal funding. They also met with leaders of the Hopi Tribe to announce a water quality project and leaders of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community to tour the construction of the River People Health Center.
