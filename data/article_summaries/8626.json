President Biden honored three soldiers with the Medal of Honor in a ceremony held at the White House. The recipients were Sergeant First Class Alwyn Cashe, Sergeant First Class Christopher Celiz, and Master Sergeant Earl Plumlee. 

Sergeant First Class Alwyn Cashe was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his acts of gallantry in Iraq in 2005. He rescued fellow soldiers from a burning vehicle while suffering severe burns himself. Despite his injuries, he went back into the vehicle multiple times to save more soldiers. He later succumbed to his injuries.

Sergeant First Class Christopher Celiz was also awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions in Afghanistan in 2018. He exposed himself to enemy fire to retrieve a heavy weapon system and shielded a helicopter and its crew from enemy fire while a wounded soldier was being evacuated. He was fatally wounded during the mission.

Staff Sergeant Earl Plumlee received the Medal of Honor for his actions in Afghanistan in 2013. He defended a base that was under attack, engaging multiple insurgents and shielding his fellow soldiers. He also carried a wounded soldier to safety and provided first aid.

President Biden emphasized the bravery and selflessness of these soldiers and expressed gratitude for their service. He also recognized the sacrifices made by military families and pledged to fulfill the nation's obligation to support and care for service members and their families.
