President Obama has declared a major disaster in South Carolina due to severe storms and flooding that began on October 1, 2015. This declaration allows federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in certain counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. The Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the area has been appointed, and damage surveys are ongoing in other areas for potential assistance. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
