Vice President Mike Pence led a discussion with the chief executives of approximately 50 states, territories, and the city of Washington, DC, and the White House Coronavirus Task Force to discuss local, state, and federal COVID-19 response and recovery efforts. Pence highlighted his recent visit to Dallas, Texas, where he met with Governor Greg Abbott and received a ground report on recent cases. Texas officials stressed that existing hospital capacity was higher than reported and emphasized their ability to "flex" capacity if needed. Pence informed the governors that he intended to travel to Arizona and Florida to receive similar updates. They also discussed best practices for limiting the spread of COVID-19 while keeping America open, expanding testing, supporting long-term care residents, and maintaining necessary healthcare capacity. The Vice President thanked the governors for their support for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and highlighted the July 1, 2020, implementation milestone. Dr. Deborah Birx discussed testing and trends, and Dr. Anthony Fauci stressed that public health measures should not be an all or nothing approach. Secretary Alex Azar urged governors to encourage previous COVID-19 patients to donate convalescent plasma and highlighted the securing of large supplies of the therapeutic, remdesivir. Admiral Brett Giroir provided an update on community-based testing, and Admiral John Polowczyk provided a logistics update on the expansion of domestic production of key resources and the restocking of the National Stockpile. Several governors discussed leading practices to control the spread of COVID-19.
