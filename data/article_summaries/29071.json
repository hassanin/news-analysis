The article discusses the issue of immigration and the current policy of prosecuting adults who cross the border illegally, but not those who bring children with them. This policy has led to a significant increase in the number of people illegally crossing with children. The article argues that this policy undermines the integrity of the system and should be ended. Instead, adults will be prosecuted for illegal entry regardless of whether they have children with them. However, the children will not be put in jail but will be cared for by the Department of Health and Human Services. The article states that these children receive quality care, including food, education, and healthcare, at taxpayer expense. The article also mentions that separations are temporary and rare, and that many children in custody came to the country by themselves and have been abused or recruited by criminal gangs. The article emphasizes that the Trump administration is taking steps to put traffickers out of business and argues that people with genuine asylum claims should come to a port of entry to make their claim legally. The article concludes by calling for a safe and lawful system of immigration and the enforcement of immigration laws.
