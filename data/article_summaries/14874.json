President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New York due to the effects of Hurricane Irene. This declaration allows federal funding to be provided to individuals and businesses affected by the hurricane. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for state and local governments and certain nonprofit organizations for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for funding. Philip E. Parr has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional counties may be designated for assistance after further damage assessments are completed. Individuals and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free phone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week until further notice. For further information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
