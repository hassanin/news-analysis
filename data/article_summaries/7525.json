Mexico's Secretary of Security, Rosa Icela Rodriguez, hosted a virtual meeting with U.S. Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and Canada's National Security and Intelligence Advisor Jody Thomas.

The committee discussed various actions to address the illicit fentanyl threat, including intensifying prosecution of drug traffickers, targeting the supply of precursor chemicals, preventing drug trafficking across borders, and promoting public health services. The three countries also committed to establishing an expert working group and an agile mechanism to share information on emerging drug trends. They will present progress on their joint efforts within the committee to the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats.
