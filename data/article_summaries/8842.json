National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, along with White House Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa Brett McGurk, will be visiting Cairo, Egypt for official meetings. The discussions between the U.S. and Egyptian delegations will focus on supporting Libyan elections, regional security in the Horn of Africa, and emphasizing the importance of human rights in the strategic relationship. Additionally, Sullivan will talk about Egypt's role in promoting security and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians, following Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's visit to Egypt earlier this month. After his regional travel, Sullivan will host Israeli National Security Advisor Dr. Eyal Hulata in Washington on October 5 for further discussions on these topics and a meeting of the U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative Group.
