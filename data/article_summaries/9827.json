On April 2, 2012, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 473, also known as the "Help to Access Land for the Education of Scouts" or "HALE Scouts Act," directs the Secretary of Agriculture to sell land at fair market value to the Indian Nations Council, Inc., of the Boy Scouts of America. The land is adjacent to the Council's existing campground. 

The second bill, H.R. 886, is called the "United States Marshals Service 225th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act." This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to mint and issue coins to commemorate the 225th anniversary of the establishment of the United States Marshals Service.
