President Trump announced a new initiative to expand VA services to veterans through telehealth services. This will allow veterans to connect with their VA healthcare team using their own smartphones or computers, significantly increasing access to care, especially in the areas of mental health and suicide prevention. The VA is launching a mobile app that will allow patients to schedule and change their appointments at VA facilities using their smartphones. The President highlighted the progress made in the past six months, including signing historic VA accountability legislation and extending and improving the Veterans Choice Program. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin, explained that the new regulation will allow VA providers to provide telehealth services from anywhere in the country to veterans anywhere in the country, thereby removing geography as a barrier to care. This will enable the use of VA providers in cities with more doctors to assist veterans in rural areas. The VA is also rolling out VA Video Connect, which allows VA providers to connect with veterans on their mobile devices or home computers, and a new technology called Veterans Appointment Request, which allows veterans to schedule their appointments directly with VA providers.
