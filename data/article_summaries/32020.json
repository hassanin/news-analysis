The Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly employment situation report confirms that the U.S. labor market continued to expand in January 2020. The report shows that the economy added 225,000 jobs, surpassing market expectations. The sectors with the largest job gains were education and health services, construction, and leisure and hospitality. The report also includes revisions to previous data, revealing that fewer jobs were added in the year ending in March 2019 than previously reported. However, due to strong job growth in January, the economy has still added 7 million jobs since President Trump's election. Wage growth has also been positive, with average hourly earnings growing 3.1% year-over-year. Historically disadvantaged groups, such as African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans, have benefited from the tight labor market, with unemployment rates reaching record lows in 2019. The slight increase in the unemployment rate in January can be attributed to an increase in labor force participation as more workers entered the job market. Overall, the strong jobs report indicates confidence in the economy and improved job prospects.
