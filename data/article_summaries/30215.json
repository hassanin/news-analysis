The United States has captured Mustafa al-Imam in Libya for his alleged role in the 2012 Benghazi attacks. The attacks resulted in the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens, Glen Doherty, Sean Smith, and Tyrone Woods. The United States vows to bring the perpetrators to justice and thanks the law enforcement, prosecutors, intelligence community, and military personnel for their efforts. The United States will continue to support Libya in preventing terrorist groups from using the country as a safe haven. Libya's stability and security depend on the formation of a unified government and military, and the United States encourages all Libyans to support the ongoing reconciliation process.
