President Biden spoke at the South Court Auditorium about the expanded Child Tax Credit, which provides monthly payments to working families with children. The tax credit is one of the largest-ever single tax cuts for families with children and aims to reduce child poverty in America. The payments are automatic and will be received by nearly all working families making under $150,000 annually. The tax credit is fully refundable and will be paid out at $300 per child under the age of 6 and $250 per child between the ages of 6 and 17 on a monthly basis between July and December. The President emphasized that this tax cut is a middle-class tax cut and will benefit hardworking families. He also highlighted the transformative impact it can have on children's lives, including better health, school performance, and future earnings. The President thanked those who advocated for the expanded tax credit and called for its extension in the future. He emphasized the importance of making the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share to afford tax cuts for working families. The President closed by urging people to spread the word about the tax credit and its positive impact on families.
