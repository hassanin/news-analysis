The article discusses the efforts of the Biden-Harris Administration to advance the human rights of LGBTQI+ individuals both domestically and internationally. The administration is implementing a Presidential Memorandum that aims to promote and protect the rights of LGBTQI+ persons worldwide. The Department of State, Department of Labor, and USAID are using diplomacy and foreign assistance to combat the criminalization of LGBTQI+ status or conduct abroad. They are also working to protect vulnerable LGBTQI+ refugees and asylum seekers, provide foreign assistance to advance nondiscrimination and human rights, respond to human rights abuses, build international coalitions, and rescind policies inconsistent with the President's Memorandum. These efforts include supporting civil society programs, providing emergency assistance, and engaging with international organizations and alliances.
