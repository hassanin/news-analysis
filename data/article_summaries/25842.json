On World Autism Awareness Day, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation recognizing and supporting individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). He mentioned that millions of adults and an estimated 1 in 68 children in the United States have been diagnosed with ASD. The proclamation emphasized the need for accurate identification and diagnosis of ASD in both children and adults, as well as access to effective care, resources, and support services. President Trump also highlighted the signing of the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage (RAISE) Family Caregivers Act, which provides a national framework to support families caring for loved ones with ASD. The Department of Health and Human Services released a report detailing available services for young people with ASD transitioning into adulthood, and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee ensures engagement with individuals with ASD and their families. The proclamation calls for increased access to information, understanding, respect, and dignity for people with ASD, and encourages Americans to learn more about autism and support individuals with autism and their families and caregivers.
