Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating condition that affects around 100,000 Americans. It can cause episodes of pain, vision difficulties, fatigue, infections, strokes, and organ failure. The disease disproportionately affects Black and Brown Americans, with 1 in 13 Black children testing positive for the sickle cell trait and 1 in 365 developing the disease. Systemic inequities in healthcare mean that these patients often struggle to access adequate treatment and pain management. While there is no universally effective cure, recent advancements include new drug therapies for pain management and ongoing research into genetic therapies and machine learning applications to predict organ function decline. It is important for Americans to be aware of the signs, risks, and resources available for sickle cell disease. President Biden has proclaimed September 2022 as National Sickle Cell Awareness Month and encourages people to learn more about efforts to reduce the burden of the disease.
