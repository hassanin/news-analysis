President Obama will be delivering remarks about the progress made in improving the health care system through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other administration efforts. He will discuss the upcoming open enrollment period for the Health Insurance Marketplace, as well as the administration's efforts to sign up young adults for coverage. The ACA has resulted in an estimated 20 million adults gaining health insurance coverage, and children have also seen major coverage gains. The uninsured rate for people of all ages is now at its lowest level on record. Health care costs have also improved, with health care prices rising at the slowest rate in 50 years since the ACA passed. The ACA has also focused on improving the quality of patient care, reducing avoidable hospital readmissions, and catalyzing the development of Medicare value-based payment models. The article also highlights the need for continued improvements, such as investing in research and technologies for initiatives like the Cancer Moonshot and reducing the costs of prescription drugs. The President believes in common-sense ways to improve the ACA, including working with states to expand Medicaid, increasing financial support for individuals struggling with insurance bills, and ensuring a choice of health insurance issuers. The article also discusses the improved access to care and affordability provided by the ACA, including tax credits, health plan disclosure requirements, and the elimination of out-of-pocket costs for preventive services. The ACA has also helped slow the growth of health care spending and created Accountable Care Organizations. The article concludes by mentioning the incentives provided by the ACA to reduce hospital-acquired infections and avoidable readmissions, as well as other actions taken by the administration to advance effective, accountable, and affordable health care.
