In this op-ed, First Lady Michelle Obama discusses the issue of girls' education around the world. She highlights that over 62 million girls are out of school, facing barriers such as unaffordable fees, early marriage, and societal beliefs that prioritize boys' education. Obama argues that this is not just a moral issue but also a public health, national security, and economic issue. She emphasizes that educating girls can lead to better health outcomes, lower rates of maternal and infant mortality, and increased earning power. Obama also shares her personal connection to the issue as a mother and expresses the need for parents and grandparents to fight against the injustice faced by these girls. She announces new partnerships between the US and the UK to educate adolescent girls in developing countries and highlights previous initiatives like Let Girls Learn. Obama calls for a global solution to the problem and pledges to continue advocating for girls' education even after her time as first lady.
