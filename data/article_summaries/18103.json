The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attacks on a religious procession in Quetta and an Ahmedi worship center in Peshawar. The attacks targeted innocent civilians during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, making them even more reprehensible. The US government offers its condolences to the families of the victims and continues to assist and work closely with the Government of Pakistan in its efforts to rebuild and recover from the devastating floods caused by monsoons. The US will stand with the people of Pakistan during these challenging times.
