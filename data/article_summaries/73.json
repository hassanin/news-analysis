During a press call, senior administration officials outlined the consequences of a lack of additional funding for the United States' COVID-19 response. They emphasized the need for immediate funding to implement the National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan and discussed the potential impacts of a lack of funding on vaccines, treatments, preventative treatments for immunocompromised individuals, the uninsured fund, testing capacity, and the global response. Without additional funding, the US may not have enough resources to purchase booster shots for all Americans, provide enough monoclonal antibody treatments, maintain testing capacity beyond June, or support global vaccination efforts. The officials highlighted the importance of acting now to prevent severe consequences and save lives. They also addressed questions about the need for government involvement in purchasing these resources, the possibility of exploring alternate avenues for funding, and the outreach efforts made to Congress.
