President Joe Biden has proclaimed September 17 through September 23, 2023, as National Farm Safety and Health Week in the United States. The proclamation highlights the importance of protecting the well-being of farmers, farmworkers, and ranchers who play a crucial role in feeding the nation, powering the economy, and leading the world. The agricultural industry is known for its high risks, with agriculture having nearly six times as many fatalities as other industries. Hazards such as tractor rollovers, road accidents, heavy labor, unsafe pesticides, extreme weather, and volatile markets pose significant risks to those working in agriculture. Additionally, the closure of rural hospitals has made it more challenging for agricultural workers to access emergency treatment and healthcare services. 

President Biden emphasizes his commitment to being the most pro-worker president in history and providing resources to rural communities to ensure the health and safety of agricultural workers. The administration has taken several measures to protect workers, including issuing the first-ever Heat Hazard Alert, increasing enforcement of heat-safety violations, conducting more inspections in high-risk industries like agriculture, and working towards a national standard for workplace heat-safety rules. The Department of Agriculture is investing $500 million in rural healthcare services, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocates $65 billion to improve broadband access, facilitating remote telehealth services. The Inflation Reduction Act aims to reduce healthcare coverage premiums and prescription drug prices for seniors. Furthermore, new rules are proposed to require health insurers to cover mental health care on par with other medical treatments, and initiatives like the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics and the nationwide Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (9-8-8) are being implemented to address mental health needs.

The administration is also focused on boosting the rural economy by providing funds to expand access to small and midsized meat and poultry processing, supporting new and innovative products like plant-based packaging materials and sustainable aviation fuels, and ensuring the success of small and midsized farmers and ranchers. President Biden concludes by urging Americans to express appreciation and gratitude to farmers, farmworkers, and ranchers for their dedicated service to the nation.
