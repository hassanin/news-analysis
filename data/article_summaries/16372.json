The President emphasizes the importance of fair competition in the global economy and states that his administration stands up for strong trade enforcement. They have filed more enforcement complaints in the World Trade Organization (WTO) than any other member and have won all of the challenges that have been decided. The President announces that they are filing a new complaint against China's trade practices, specifically mentioning unfair advantages given to China's aluminum industry through underpriced loans and illegal government subsidies. These policies have disadvantaged American manufacturers and contributed to global overproduction in sectors such as aluminum and steel. The President assures that they are taking action to protect workers affected by these policies and highlights their record of forceful and effective trade enforcement on behalf of American businesses and workers. The President concludes by stating that American workers win when the playing field is level.
