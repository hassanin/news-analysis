President Obama's Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative aims to highlight the role of fathers in creating strong families. The initiative has supported local fatherhood programs, organized town halls, and partnered with organizations. The President hosted military fathers and their children for a screening of Cars 2 as part of the Joining Forces initiative. Fatherlessness is a growing crisis in America, leading to various challenges such as school dropout, drug use, and involvement in the criminal justice system. The initiative aims to provide opportunities for fathers and kids to connect through partnerships with organizations like bowling centers, sports leagues, zoos, and aquariums. Various government offices have also organized events to emphasize the importance of fatherhood and mentorship. The Secretary of Education encouraged fathers to be more involved in education, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will focus on fathers in public housing. The White House will also spotlight 12 dads who have made a positive impact on their families and communities. The Department of Health and Human Services will announce new support for local fatherhood programs.
