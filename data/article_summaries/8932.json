President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed October 11, 2022, as General Pulaski Memorial Day, honoring the heroism and service of Casimir Pulaski. Pulaski, known as the "Father of the American Cavalry," played a crucial role in the American Revolution, leading a skillful counterattack against the British and saving George Washington's life. The proclamation recognizes the contributions of Polish-Americans, who number around 9 million and contribute to the prosperity and vibrancy of communities across the United States. It also highlights the strong alliance between Poland and the United States in defending democracy and collective security, particularly in light of Russia's actions in Ukraine. The proclamation encourages Americans to commemorate General Pulaski and honor those who defend the freedom of the nation.
