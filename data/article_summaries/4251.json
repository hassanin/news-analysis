The Heads of State and Government of Argentina, Barbados, Belize, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the United States, and Uruguay have gathered in Los Angeles to discuss and strengthen efforts to create safe, orderly, humane, and regular migration. They emphasize the importance of promoting conditions in which people can lead peaceful and dignified lives in their countries of origin and ensure that migration is a voluntary choice rather than a necessity. The leaders commit to protecting the safety and dignity of all migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless persons, regardless of their migratory status, and respecting their human rights and fundamental freedoms. They also acknowledge that addressing irregular international migration requires a regional approach and that the ongoing challenges of the pandemic exacerbate the root causes of irregular migration. The leaders value the tradition of welcoming refugees and migrants in the region and recognize their positive contributions to host communities. They commit to leveraging the benefits of migration while addressing its challenges in countries and communities of origin, transit, destination, and return. The leaders also intend to strengthen migration management institutions, promote stability and assistance for communities involved in migration, establish regular pathways for migration and international protection, manage migration in a humane way, and coordinate emergency responses. The Declaration is aligned with existing international commitments and frameworks and emphasizes the importance of human rights, transparency, non-discrimination, and state sovereignty.
