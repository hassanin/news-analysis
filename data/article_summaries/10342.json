The 2011 APEC Leaders' Meeting will be held in Honolulu on November 12 and 13, 2011. President Obama is excited to welcome other APEC economy leaders to his birthplace and showcase Hawaii's culture and hospitality. The United States sees itself as a Pacific nation with strong economic ties to the Asia-Pacific region, and hosting APEC in 2011 will allow them to highlight the potential for American companies and workers in the region. The US also aims to shape the future of the Asia-Pacific's regional architecture and promote APEC's mission of fostering regional economic integration.
