President Biden gave a speech providing an update on the vaccination program in the United States. He highlighted the progress made so far, with over 220 million shots administered and nearly 150 million Americans receiving at least one shot. The President also mentioned that cases are down in 40 states and deaths among seniors have dropped by over 80 percent. 

Moving forward, the focus will be on three areas. First, the vaccination of children between the ages of 12 and 15, pending FDA authorization. The administration is prepared to immediately vaccinate adolescents once approval is granted. Second, efforts will be made to make the vaccination process more convenient. A website, Vaccines.gov, has been launched to help people find vaccination locations, and a texting service is available for those who prefer to use their phones. Walk-in hours will also be provided at pharmacies, and vaccines will be shipped to pediatricians. The goal is to make it easier for those who have had trouble finding or scheduling appointments to get vaccinated. 

The third area of focus is addressing vaccine hesitancy. President Biden emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated to protect oneself and others, and he urged younger people, who may believe they don't need the vaccine, to reconsider. Efforts will be made to provide more information and to involve trusted community members and leaders in encouraging vaccination. 

The President set a new goal for the country: to have 70 percent of adult Americans with at least one shot and 160 million Americans fully vaccinated by July 4th. He emphasized the need for continued adherence to CDC guidelines and expressed optimism that progress can be made in convincing more Americans to get vaccinated. Additionally, President Biden mentioned that the United States is committed to sending a significant number of vaccine doses to other countries, starting with India and Brazil.
