The February Employment Situation Report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that nominal average hourly earnings rose by 3.4 percent over the past 12 months, the fastest growth since 2009. Real wages, taking inflation into account, are also growing. The economy added 20,000 jobs in February, falling short of expectations, but the average jobs growth in the past 12 months was 209,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent in February, just above the 50-year low of 3.7 percent reached in November. The labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio remain unchanged but are at their highest levels in several years. Overall, the report indicates continued growth and strength in the United States labor market.
