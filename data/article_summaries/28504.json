Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch has proven himself to be a calm and knowledgeable nominee who should be confirmed by the Senate, according to an editorial in The Detroit News. Despite attempts by Democrats on the Judicial Committee to paint Gorsuch as an extremist, the evidence to support this claim is weak. Gorsuch defended his rulings on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and pointed out that the majority of his decisions were unanimous. He has displayed an impressive depth of knowledge and patience during the hearings, refusing to reveal how he would rule on specific issues. The editorial concludes that Gorsuch is qualified and there is nothing radical in his judicial history, but Democrats want his confirmation to be a demonstration of their resistance to President Trump.
