The Department of Transportation has announced that it has initiated over 10,000 transportation projects across the United States through the allocation of funds from the Recovery Act. These projects include improvements to highways, bridges, rail, and airports, and have created job opportunities during a challenging economic period. The Department of Transportation has made $48.1 billion available for construction and repairs, with $30.6 billion already allocated to fund approved projects. Various DOT agencies have been working to quickly distribute funds for local transportation projects, including airport improvements, road and bridge projects, transit agency support, Amtrak grants, and capital improvements to small shipyards. The DOT also plans to award $8 billion in grants for high-speed rail and $1.5 billion in TIGER Discretionary Grants.
