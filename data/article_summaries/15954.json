President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring December 10, 2016, as Human Rights Day and the week beginning December 10, 2016, as Human Rights Week. The proclamation reflects on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, which proclaimed that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. It acknowledges the progress made in advancing human rights and democracy worldwide, but also recognizes the challenges that still exist, including discrimination against various groups such as LGBT individuals, people with disabilities, immigrants, women and girls, and religious and ethnic minorities. The proclamation calls for continued efforts to promote justice, inclusion, and the protection of human rights for all individuals.
