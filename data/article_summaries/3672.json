President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. has declared a major disaster in the State of Mississippi following severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes that occurred from March 24 to March 25, 2023. This declaration allows for Federal aid to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The counties of Carroll, Humphreys, Monroe, and Sharkey are eligible for assistance, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs for individuals and business owners. Federal funding is also available to State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work in these counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are eligible for Federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Mr. John F. Boyle of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing in other areas, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance through www.DisasterAssistance.gov, by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the FEMA App.
