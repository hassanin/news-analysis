More than 200 colleges and universities in the United States have signed the American Campuses Act on Climate Pledge to demonstrate their support for strong international climate action. These schools include a variety of institutions such as historically black colleges and universities, religious institutions, women's colleges, technical schools, community colleges, and all schools in the Ivy League. The signatories are also taking significant action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase campus sustainability, and incorporate environmental action into academic curriculum. Over 100 of the schools that signed the pledge have set goals to become carbon neutral in the future. In addition, a climate change campus campaign called Defend Our Future has been launched, aiming to empower over 1 million young Americans to take action on climate change. The announcement was made at a White House Summit, where university presidents, students, and NGOs gathered to discuss the important work being done to address climate change in higher education. The impacts of climate change are already being felt worldwide, and this initiative highlights American leadership on climate action and supports a successful global agreement on climate change.
