In a recent press briefing, Jeff Zients, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Dr. Vivek Murthy provided updates on the progress in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. They highlighted the rising cases driven by the Delta variant, particularly in communities with low vaccination rates. States with low vaccination rates, such as Florida, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, accounted for about half of new cases and hospitalizations in the past week. However, there has been an increase in vaccinations in these states as well as in other states with lagging vaccination rates. Businesses, universities, and medical schools are also stepping up with vaccination requirements. The officials emphasized the importance of vaccinations and the need to protect workers, communities, and the country. They also discussed the consideration of booster shots for immunocompromised individuals and the ongoing efforts to prevent the virus from mutating further. The officials acknowledged the need for vaccine verification in businesses and the private sector's efforts in developing vaccine verification systems. They also addressed questions about the severity of the Delta variant and its impact on children.
