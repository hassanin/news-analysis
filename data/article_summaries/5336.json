The President is urging Congress to take action to hold senior bank executives accountable for the failure of their banks. This includes expanding the FDIC's authority to claw back compensation, imposing civil penalties, and banning executives from working in the banking industry again. The President wants the FDIC to have the power to claw back compensation, including gains from stock sales, from executives at failed banks. Currently, the FDIC's clawback authority only applies to the largest financial institutions and should be extended to cover a broader set of large banks. The President also wants to strengthen the FDIC's authority to bar executives from holding jobs in the banking industry when their banks enter receivership. Additionally, the FDIC's authority to bring fines against executives of failed banks should be expanded. The President emphasizes the need for accountability and is ready to work with Congress to strengthen it.
