President Biden emphasizes the importance of following the science and being transparent about the situation. He highlights the success of the vaccination campaign, with over 300 million shots administered and a significant percentage of adults vaccinated. The decline in cases and deaths is attributed to the rapid deployment of vaccines, potentially saving 100,000 American lives.

The CDC's recommendation to resume wearing masks in certain parts of the country is seen as a necessary step in the fight against the Delta variant. President Biden urges Americans to adhere to the CDC guidance, including himself when he travels to those areas. However, he also stresses that the CDC has reaffirmed that schools can safely reopen in the fall, with masking being an inconvenience but providing necessary protection for students.

President Biden emphasizes the importance of vaccination as the primary defense against the Delta variant. While progress has been made, he acknowledges that there is still work to be done in increasing vaccination rates. He plans to announce further steps to encourage more Americans to get vaccinated. Vaccinations are emphasized as free, safe, and effective for every American.

President Biden reassures that by following the science and getting vaccinated, America can overcome COVID-19. He emphasizes the importance of vaccinations and mask-wearing in areas most affected by the Delta variant to prevent lockdowns, shutdowns, school closures, and disruptions experienced in 2020. President Biden believes that unlike in 2020, the country now has both the scientific knowledge and tools to control the spread of the disease and avoid returning to previous restrictions.
