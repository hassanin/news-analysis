The Biden Administration is facilitating the shipment of approximately 16 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Gerber Good Start Gentle infant formula from Mexico to Fort Worth, Texas. This is part of Operation Fly Formula, which aims to speed up the import of infant formula and make it available in stores faster. The Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, the General Services Administration, and the Department of Defense are working together to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards. In addition to this shipment, Nestl√© plans to export approximately 42 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula into the U.S. market. The Biden Administration has also taken other actions, such as invoking the Defense Production Act and issuing guidance for formula manufacturers to safely import formula that is not currently produced for the U.S. market.
