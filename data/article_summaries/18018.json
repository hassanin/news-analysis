Prime Minister Gillard and President Obama announced two force posture initiatives that will enhance defense cooperation between Australia and the United States. The first initiative involves the deployment of U.S. Marines to Darwin and Northern Australia for training and exercises on a rotational basis. Initially, a small liaison element and a company of 250 U.S. Marines will be deployed, with the goal of establishing a rotational presence of up to 2,500 Marines in the future. The second initiative involves closer cooperation between the Royal Australian Air Force and the U.S. Air Force, resulting in increased rotations of U.S. aircraft through northern Australia. These initiatives aim to strengthen regional security, increase interoperability between the two countries' forces, and enhance capabilities for combined training. Additionally, the initiatives will position Australia and the U.S. to respond effectively to contingencies in the Asia-Pacific region, including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
