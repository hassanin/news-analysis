President Biden announced that the United States has administered 300 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in just 150 days. He credited the achievement to the efforts of American scientists, companies, and a whole-of-government response. The country now has over 81,000 vaccination sites, including local pharmacies, and has deployed over 9,000 federal personnel to support the vaccination effort. Biden highlighted the progress made in closing the racial gap in vaccination rates, with over half of all vaccinations in the last month going to people of color. However, he also expressed concern about the Delta variant, which is more transmissible and dangerous, particularly for young people. Biden urged Americans to get fully vaccinated, emphasizing that the existing vaccines are effective against the variant. He also addressed the ongoing rift within the Catholic Church over abortion, stating that it is a private matter.
