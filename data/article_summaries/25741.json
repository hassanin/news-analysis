President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands due to Super Typhoon Yutu. Federal funding will be made available to affected individuals in the municipalities of Rota, Saipan, Tinian, and the Northern Islands. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery.
