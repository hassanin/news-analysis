Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo announced a new $3 billion economic development initiative that will be run by the Department of Commerce. The initiative, funded by the American Rescue Plan, is the largest local economic development initiative that the Commerce Department has ever made. It aims to create high-quality jobs for communities across America, particularly for those who have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, such as women, people of color, rural communities, and Tribes. The initiative includes a $1 billion "Build Back Better Regional Challenge" for revitalizing economies, a $500 million "Good Jobs Challenge" for workforce training and apprenticeships, $750 million for the recovery of travel, tourism, and outdoor recreation, $500 million for economic development in communities affected by the loss of jobs, $100 million for Indigenous communities, and $300 million for economic development in coal-affected communities. The grants will prioritize equity and will be distributed to states, cities, counties, nonprofits, and universities. Applications for the funding are now open. In the press briefing, Secretary Raimondo also discussed the administration's efforts to address the chip shortage and its commitment to investigating the origins of the coronavirus. The White House confirmed that it supports the World Health Organization's plan for a second phase of investigation into the origins of the virus and is disappointed with China's rejection of the plan. The White House emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in the investigation.
