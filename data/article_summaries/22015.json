The White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault has announced a series of actions to address the issue of sexual assault on college campuses. These actions include implementing climate surveys to accurately measure the prevalence of sexual assault on campuses, implementing prevention programs that change social norms and encourage bystander intervention, providing support and resources for schools to effectively respond to sexual assault cases, and improving federal enforcement efforts by increasing transparency and coordination among agencies. The Task Force will continue to work towards finding solutions and enhancing enforcement to end sexual assault on campuses.
