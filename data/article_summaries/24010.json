This article discusses an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in 2015 that establishes a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a process for soliciting and considering stakeholder input. The order aims to improve the resilience of communities and federal assets against flooding, which is anticipated to increase due to climate change and other threats. It amends Executive Order 11988, which requires agencies to avoid adverse impacts associated with occupying and modifying floodplains. The order establishes a new flood risk reduction standard for federally funded projects, known as the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (Standard). This Standard expands floodplain management to address current and future flood risk and ensures that taxpayer-funded projects are resilient. The order also sets forth a process for soliciting and considering public input, including from Governors, mayors, and other stakeholders, prior to implementing the Standard. The Water Resources Council is responsible for issuing amended guidelines to agencies for implementing the order, based on stakeholder input. The order also includes provisions for reassessing and updating the Standard periodically.
