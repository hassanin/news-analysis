President Biden is committed to honoring the Federal government's commitment to Tribal Nations and Native communities. This includes record investments through the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provide the largest direct federal investment and infrastructure investment in Indian Country, respectively. The Administration has also taken steps to improve Tribal consultation, expand protections for Tribal victims, develop public safety and justice strategies for Native communities, and secure advance appropriations for the Indian Health Service. The President's Budget, developed in consultation with Tribal leaders, continues this commitment with historic investments in the Indian Health Service, Tribal public safety, affordable housing, education, and more. These efforts aim to uphold America's trust and treaty responsibilities with Tribal Nations.
