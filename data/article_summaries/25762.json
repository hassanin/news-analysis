They praise him as a foreign policy heavyweight, an excellent leader, and adept at tough diplomacy. Supporters highlight Pompeo's intelligence, integrity, experience, and understanding of world affairs. They argue that his qualifications make him well-suited to lead the State Department and implement President Trump's foreign policy. Some critics, however, oppose Pompeo's nomination based on political differences, while others express concerns about the current dangerous global climate and the need for an effective Secretary of State. Overall, Pompeo's nomination is seen as a wise choice for the future of US foreign policy.
