President Donald J. Trump recently spoke with Lt. Col. Dick Cole, the last surviving member of the famous Doolittle Raiders. Lt. Col. Cole, who is 101 years old, was recently injured. President Trump wished him well, congratulated him on his courage, thanked him for his service, and wished him a full recovery in advance of his upcoming 102nd birthday. Lt. Col. Cole served as co-pilot of the lead B-25 bomber during the daring 1942 raid on Tokyo after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Raiders knew they would not have enough fuel to return, so they bailed out over China and received assistance from Chinese soldiers, civilians, and an American missionary. President Trump expressed his appreciation for the service and sacrifice of all veterans as Independence Day is celebrated.
