Belgium and the United States have successfully removed all excess fresh highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium from Belgium. This collaboration between the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration’s Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) and Belgium’s Studiecentrum voor Kernenergie (SCK-CEN) involved the development of a new facility, training and certification of personnel, and validation of certificates for nuclear material packaging. The material, which supported research and development activities in Belgium, was securely stored under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards before being transported to the United States. The material will be stored in secure facilities until disposal or downblending to Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) for civilian use. The United States and Belgium plan to continue working together to eliminate additional stocks of special nuclear material and assist other countries in doing the same.
