President Obama is calling for the restoration of statutory pay-as-you-go requirements, which would put fiscal responsibility into law. The President wants Congress to approve legislation that would require any new tax cuts or entitlement programs to be paid for, meaning Congress can only spend a dollar if it saves a dollar somewhere else. The plan includes automatic cuts in mandatory programs as penalties for violations of the pay-as-you-go requirements. The Office of Management and Budget would maintain a ledger to record the budgetary effects of legislation, and if Congress has not succeeded in paying for all the new costs it has enacted, the President would be required to issue an order sequestering budgetary resources from certain mandatory programs. This plan aims to bring back fiscal discipline and move towards a more sustainable budget.
