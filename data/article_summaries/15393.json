The article discusses the "Race to the Top" initiative, which aims to reform America's public schools and improve education for all students. The initiative is backed by a $4.35 billion investment and encourages states to implement innovative approaches to teaching and learning. The competition consists of two rounds, with winners announced in April and September of the following year. To be eligible to compete, states must have their second round State Fiscal Stabilization applications approved and not have any barriers to linking student achievement data to teacher evaluation. The reform areas emphasized in the Race to the Top include implementing rigorous standards and assessments, attracting and retaining great teachers, supporting data systems, turning around struggling schools, and promoting collaboration and innovation. The article also highlights progress made by states in implementing education reforms consistent with the Race to the Top principles.
