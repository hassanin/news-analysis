The article is about a presidential memorandum issued by Donald J. Trump regarding the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008. In the memorandum, Trump determines that it is in the national interest of the United States to waive the application of the prohibition in section 404(a) of the CSPA with respect to Afghanistan, Iraq, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen. This waiver allows for the provision of various forms of military assistance and support to these countries, despite the CSPA's prohibition. Trump also certifies that the governments of these countries are taking effective and continuing steps to address the issue of child soldiers. The memorandum directs the Secretary of State to submit the determination to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
