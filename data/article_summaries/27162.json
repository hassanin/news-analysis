Second Lady Karen Pence participated in the launch of the PREVENTS National Health Campaign called REACH, emphasizing the need to address suicide and focus on mental health. The campaign aims to empower veterans and all Americans to prevent suicide by changing the conversation and creating an environment where people reach out to those who may be vulnerable. On average, 132 Americans die by suicide each day, and the suicide rate is 1.5 times higher for veterans. The REACH campaign is a critical component of the President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS) initiative.
