President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation on July 26, 2019, honoring the Korean War veterans on National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. The proclamation recognizes the sacrifices made by the brave patriots who fought for freedom and democracy in the Republic of Korea. It pays tribute to the more than 23,600 Americans who were killed in action and the over 103,000 who were wounded in the conflict. The proclamation also highlights the dedication stone at the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., which honors the American soldiers who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met. It mentions the enduring alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea, which was cemented when American troops arrived to fight for liberty and human dignity. The proclamation emphasizes the ongoing effort to achieve the complete and verifiable denuclearization of North Korea, establish a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, and continue the recovery and repatriation of remains of fallen American soldiers. President Trump calls upon all Americans to observe National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor and give thanks to the distinguished Korean War veterans.
