Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a roundtable event at the Hotel Fairmont in San Francisco, California. She thanked the leaders of California for their leadership on various important issues, including healthcare. Harris highlighted the healthcare crisis in America, particularly in light of the recent Dobbs decision by the Supreme Court. She also mentioned positive economic news, such as zero percent inflation in July and the creation of over half a million jobs in the previous month. Harris emphasized the administration's focus on reducing the cost of living and supporting working families. She discussed the administration's efforts to cut poverty, support small businesses, invest in infrastructure, and improve access to high-speed internet. Harris also praised California's commitment to the environment and announced the upcoming signing of a law investing $370 billion to address the climate crisis. She criticized the Dobbs decision for taking away a constitutional right recognized by the people, particularly women, and mentioned the passing of laws in other states that criminalize healthcare providers and do not make exceptions for rape or incest. Harris expressed her opposition to such laws and praised California for respecting the principles of freedom and liberty by allowing individuals to make their own personal decisions without government interference. She concluded by expressing her gratitude to the leaders present and discussing the collaboration between the administration and California. The roundtable discussion then commenced.
