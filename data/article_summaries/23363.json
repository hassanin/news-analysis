President Obama is traveling to Afghanistan to sign a Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) between the United States and Afghanistan. The SPA provides a long-term framework for the relationship between the two countries after the process of transition and the drawdown of U.S. forces. It details how the partnership between the countries will be normalized as the war comes to an end. The agreement comes at a time when substantial progress has been made towards achieving the goal of defeating al Qaeda and denying it the ability to rebuild a safe haven. The strategy to achieve this goal and end the war in Afghanistan has five elements: transitioning to Afghan lead for security; training Afghan security forces; building an enduring partnership with Afghanistan; reconciliation within the country; and promoting regional stability. The SPA does not commit the United States to any specific troop level or levels of funding in the future, as those decisions must be made in consultation with the U.S. Congress. The agreement allows for the possibility of U.S. forces in Afghanistan after 2014 for two specific purposes: training Afghan forces and targeting the remnants of al Qaeda. The agreement also establishes implementing arrangements and mechanisms to ensure the commitments of both countries are effectively carried out. Overall, the SPA aims to bring the war in Afghanistan to a responsible end and build a lasting peace and stability in the region.
