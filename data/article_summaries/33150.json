In a proclamation issued on March 29, 2019, President Donald J. Trump recognizes Cancer Control Month and honors those battling cancer and the survivors. The proclamation highlights the importance of continued efforts to find effective medical procedures to treat and prevent all forms of cancer. While cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States, there are hopeful signs of progress, with declining death rates for many common types of cancer. The proclamation emphasizes the role of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including weight management, healthy eating, physical activity, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, in reducing the risk of developing cancer. It also encourages discussing family health history with doctors and getting recommended cancer screenings for early diagnosis. The administration is committed to supporting cutting-edge research and medical advances, particularly in genomics, precision medicine, and immunotherapy. The Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act of 2018 was signed into law to advance research on childhood cancers, support survivors, and track pediatric cancer rates. The "Right to Try" legislation was also signed into law to expand treatment options for people with terminal illnesses. The president is working with Congress to invest $500 million in cancer-related research over the next decade. The proclamation expresses confidence in the nation's innovators and scientists to find a cure for cancer and calls upon the people of the United States to learn about preventative measures and increase awareness of cancer control.
