The White House has announced new federal investments in building energy efficiency and electrification, as well as opportunities to modernize homes and businesses. The goal is to create good-paying, union jobs and upgrade buildings to be affordable, resilient, accessible, energy efficient, and electrified. President Biden's American Jobs Plan promises to build, rehabilitate, and retrofit over two million homes and improve federal facilities. The plan also aims to create new domestic manufacturing opportunities for electric heating and cooling technology, invest in research and development for smart building advances, and enable buildings to be powered by clean electricity. A report by the Coalition for Green Capital and Rewiring America suggests that the Clean Energy Accelerator proposed in the American Jobs Plan could lead to energy bill savings of up to $750 per year for nearly 12 million American households and create nearly 700,000 good-paying jobs. The plan would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 40 million metric tons per year by 2030. The Biden Administration will work with the private sector, labor unions, building owners, and manufacturers to electrify and modernize buildings. They will also collaborate with city, state, and tribal governments to develop tools and resources for energy-efficient, affordable, and healthy buildings.
