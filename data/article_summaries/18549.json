This article discusses Executive Order 13546, which focuses on optimizing the security of biological select agents and toxins (BSAT) in the United States. The policy states that a productive scientific enterprise that utilizes BSAT is essential to national security and that these agents should be secured in a manner appropriate to their risk of misuse, theft, loss, and accidental release. The order also emphasizes the need for coordinated security measures that balance efficacy with the legitimate use of BSAT. The article defines terms such as Select Agent Program (SAP), Select Agent Regulations (SAR), and Biological Select Agents and Toxins. It highlights the risk associated with the use of BSAT, the need for optimized security and risk management, and concerns about compliance and coordination among different departments and agencies. The order calls for the tiering of the Select Agent List based on risk, exploration of options for graded protection, and consideration of reducing the overall number of agents on the list. It also requests the revision of regulations, rules, and guidance to accommodate a tiered Select Agent List. The article emphasizes the need for coordination of federal oversight for BSAT security and the establishment of the Federal Experts Security Advisory Panel to provide technical and substantive recommendations. It also mentions the role of the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity in providing technical advice and facilitating public consultation. The article concludes with provisions for sharing Select Agent Program information and general provisions regarding the implementation of the order.
