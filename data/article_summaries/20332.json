President Barack Obama has proclaimed January 2015 as National Stalking Awareness Month in the United States. Stalking is considered a crime that violates the principles of respect and decency, and it infringes on the right to feel safe and secure. It affects both men and women, with 1 in 6 American women likely to be stalked at some point in their lives. Stalking involves a pattern of unwanted contact, such as text messages, emails, and phone calls, that causes fear for the victim's safety or the safety of their loved ones. Stalking can have severe consequences, including physical and emotional harm, and some victims may be forced to change their living situations or jobs. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of addressing this hidden crime and highlights the efforts of the federal government and various organizations in combating violence against women and men. It calls on Americans to recognize the signs of stalking, acknowledge it as a serious crime, and encourage victims to seek help and support. The proclamation aims to create secure and supportive communities for all Americans.
