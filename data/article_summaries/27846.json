During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders discussed a range of topics. President Trump signed an executive order to ensure that all faith-based communities have strong advocates throughout his administration and encouraged people of all faiths to pray for the nation. Sanders also extended the President's thoughts and prayers to the victims and families of a military plane crash in Savannah, Georgia. The President's nominee for CIA Director, Gina Haspel, is scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Sanders highlighted Haspel's qualifications and widespread support for her nomination. Sanders also addressed questions about the President's knowledge of the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, stating that the President did not initially know about the payment but eventually learned. She also defended the President's decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey, citing lying, leaking, and politicizing as the reasons for his dismissal. Sanders did not provide a specific timeline for a meeting between President Trump and Russian President Putin but mentioned that the President is open to sitting down with him. Sanders also discussed China's militarization of the South China Sea, the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and the potential summit with North Korea.
