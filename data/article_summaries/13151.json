In this presidential memorandum, President Barack Obama announces a freeze on discretionary awards, bonuses, and similar payments for federal political appointees. The purpose of this freeze is to ensure that taxpayer money is spent wisely and to cut costs. The memorandum directs the suspension of cash awards, quality step increases, bonuses, and other discretionary payments or salary adjustments for politically appointed federal employees. The freeze will be effective immediately and will continue until the end of Fiscal Year 2011. The Office of Personnel Management is instructed to issue guidance to help departments and agencies implement this policy. Additionally, President Obama has proposed a salary freeze for senior political appointees in his Budget for Fiscal Year 2011, but this will require legislative action. The memorandum emphasizes the need to make tough choices on spending and acknowledges the importance of these payments to many workers and their families. It clarifies that this freeze does not affect payments or salary adjustments for federal employees who are not political appointees. The memorandum concludes by authorizing the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to publish it in the Federal Register.
