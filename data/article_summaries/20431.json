In this op-ed, Vice President Joe Biden discusses the importance of background checks for gun safety. He highlights the tragic mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012 and emphasizes the need to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands. Biden mentions meeting Colin Goddard, a survivor of the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech, who advocates for gun control. The Vice President argues that expanding background checks to include gun shows, classified ads, and online sales is a reasonable measure. He mentions the bipartisan legislation proposed by Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey, which unfortunately did not pass. Biden criticizes the fear of going against the NRA that has hindered progress in gun control. He asserts that the political landscape has changed since the Newtown shooting, and senators who voted against background checks are facing backlash from their constituents. Biden believes that the tide is turning in favor of gun safety and that those who dismissed it will come to realize that this is a turning point, not the end.
