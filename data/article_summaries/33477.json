The Trump Administration has announced a significant drop in illegal southern border apprehensions, indicating progress in securing the border and supporting law enforcement. Led by Secretary Kelly, the administration is expanding the border patrol, cracking down on sanctuary cities, and directing resources towards constructing a southern border wall. In March 2017, there were 16,600 individuals apprehended or deemed inadmissible, representing a 35% decrease from February and a 61% decrease from January when President Trump took office. This decline is a 64% decrease from the same month last year.
