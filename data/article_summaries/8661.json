President Biden announced that the United States will soon have a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine available for adolescents aged 12 and older. This comes after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the Pfizer vaccine for use in this age group, and an independent advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) voted to recommend its use. Pending the CDC's final approval, vaccinations for adolescents aged 12 and up will begin. The President emphasized the importance of getting adolescents vaccinated, as they are at risk of contracting and spreading the virus. He also highlighted the convenience and accessibility of the vaccine rollout, with thousands of pharmacies, pediatricians, and community health centers ready to administer vaccines. The President encouraged parents to take advantage of the vaccine and get their children vaccinated. Additionally, he addressed concerns about the supply of gas and rising prices, stating that the government is in close contact with Colonial Pipeline and expects good news soon. President Biden also discussed the importance of investing in education to train more people proficient in cybersecurity, as cybersecurity plays a role in mitigating such incidents. Finally, the President expressed hope for a resolution to the violence in the Middle East and optimism following discussions with bipartisan leaders about infrastructure.
