The President's Commission on White House Fellows has announced the appointment of the 2021-2022 class of White House Fellows, which is the most diverse class in the program's history. The White House Fellowship program selects professionals from diverse backgrounds to work as full-time, paid fellows for White House staff, Cabinet Secretaries, and other senior government officials. The program was created in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson with the aim of giving fellows firsthand experience with the workings of the Federal Government and increasing their sense of participation in national affairs. The fellowship is non-partisan and continues to operate under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Fellows participate in an education program throughout the year to expand their knowledge of leadership, policy-making, and contemporary issues. The mission of the program is to encourage active citizenship and service to the country. The selection process for this year's fellows was highly competitive, and the class reflects the diversity of America, with over half of the fellows being women. The fellows come from a wide range of professions, including the private sector, local government, academia, medicine, law, and the military. Applications for the 2022-2023 Fellowship year will be accepted from November 1, 2021, to January 7, 2022.
