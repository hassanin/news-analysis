President Obama has signed an Executive Order to create the Task Force on 21st Century Policing, which aims to strengthen community policing and trust between law enforcement and communities. The Task Force will be chaired by Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey and Laurie Robinson, professor of Criminology, Law and Society at George Mason University. It will include law enforcement representatives, community leaders, academics, and youth leaders. The Task Force will examine how to strengthen public trust and relationships between law enforcement and communities, as well as promote effective crime reduction. The Task Force will prepare a report and recommendations to be presented to the President, with an initial report due in March. It will engage with officials, advisors, and the public through meetings and technology. The Task Force members include Charles Ramsey, Laurie Robinson, Jose Lopez, Bryan Stevenson, Brittany Packnett, Susan Rahr, Tracey Meares, Constance Rice, Roberto Villase√±or, Sean Smoot, and Cedric L. Alexander.
