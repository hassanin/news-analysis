The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has published its Cloud Smart Strategy proposal, which is the first update to cloud policy in seven years. The strategy aims to help government agencies migrate to a safe and secure cloud network, while also achieving additional savings, improved security, and faster services. The goal is to modernize the Federal government and leverage leading solutions from both the public and private sectors to better serve agency missions, improve citizen services, and enhance cybersecurity.
