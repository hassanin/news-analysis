The President of the United States has sent a letter to Congress stating that the activities of significant transnational criminal organizations pose a threat to the stability of international political and economic systems. These organizations are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous, and are increasingly involved in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system. This weakens democratic institutions, degrades the rule of law, and undermines economic markets. The organizations also contribute to violent civil conflicts and support other dangerous individuals. The President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 with regards to transnational criminal organizations.
