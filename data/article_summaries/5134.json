Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have a long and significant history of fostering academic excellence and providing opportunities for Black students in the face of discrimination. These institutions vary in size and academic focus, serving diverse students in different settings.

HBCU graduates have achieved success in various fields, including public service, science, art, law, engineering, education, and business. Several HBCU graduates hold senior positions in the Biden-Harris Administration, such as Cedric Richmond, Michael Regan, and Vice President Kamala Harris.

However, despite their accomplishments, HBCUs still face disparities in resources and opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted these challenges. To address these issues and advance equity, the Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments and provided support for HBCUs.

Some actions taken by the administration include providing significant funding for HBCUs, strengthening the White House Initiative on HBCUs, and ensuring continued support through the Build Back Better Plan. These efforts aim to promote shared prosperity and equal opportunities for all Americans.
