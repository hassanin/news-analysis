President Trump has issued a full posthumous pardon to Jack Johnson, the first African American heavyweight boxing champion. Johnson was convicted in 1913 for violating the Mann Act, a racially motivated charge, and served 10 months in federal prison. The pardon has received widespread support from Congress, including the Congressional Black Caucus, and has been a long-standing issue for many. The President, alongside Sylvester Stallone and current heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder, signed the pardon in the Oval Office. The pardon is seen as correcting a historical injustice and honoring Johnson's contributions to boxing and society.
