President Barack Obama has proclaimed April 9, 2016, as National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. The proclamation honors the selfless service members who have sacrificed their own liberty to defend the ideals of the United States. Former prisoners of war have endured unimaginable suffering, often being physically and mentally tortured, starved, and subjected to harsh conditions. The values of honor, courage, and selflessness are particularly evident in those who have been taken as prisoners of war. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of caring for and upholding the promise to never leave our men and women on the battlefield behind. Americans are encouraged to observe this day by honoring all American prisoners of war, service members, and veterans. The proclamation also calls upon government officials and organizations to hold appropriate ceremonies and activities to commemorate this day.
