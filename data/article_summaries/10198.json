This article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes aboard Air Force One. They discuss various topics including North Korea's failed rocket launch, talks with Iran, the situation in Syria, and the President's upcoming schedule. Key points include:

- The administration has not rewarded North Korea for provocative actions, and the failed rocket launch demonstrates that they cannot be trusted to keep their commitments.
- The international community will condemn North Korea's actions and consider additional steps, including tightening sanctions.
- Talks with Iran provide an opportunity for the international community to discuss their nuclear program and for Iran to demonstrate its seriousness in pursuing negotiations.
- The administration is committed to increasing exports to the Americas and promoting small business export initiatives.
- The President's trips abroad are focused on building economic relationships and supporting American businesses and workers.
- The President is focused on protecting Second Amendment rights and enforcing existing laws regarding gun ownership.
- The President's tax rate for 2011 is estimated to be in the 20-21% range, lower than in previous years due to lower income and contributions to charity.
- The President's schedule for the following week includes meetings at the White House, honoring NASCAR champion Tony Stewart, delivering remarks on the economy in Cleveland, and attending campaign events in Michigan.
