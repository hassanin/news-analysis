Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall hosted a virtual meeting of the Trilateral Fentanyl Committee (TFC), which includes representatives from the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The committee was established by President Joe Biden, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to address the illicit fentanyl threat in North America. During the meeting, the co-chairs discussed progress made by the expert working group on enhancing regulatory and statutory frameworks related to precursor chemicals and equipment used for producing illicit fentanyl. They also shared information on illicit drug trends and recent diplomatic engagements aimed at reducing the flow of synthetic drugs and their precursor chemicals. The committee agreed to meet again in person in Mexico in early 2024 to further advance their efforts in countering the fentanyl problem.
