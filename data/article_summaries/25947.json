The article discusses the efforts of the Trump Administration to prioritize the efficient management of federal operations in a cost-effective manner that supports agencies' missions and advances environmental protection. The Office of Federal Sustainability (OFS), housed within the Council on Environmental Quality, has worked with federal agencies to help them meet statutory requirements and optimize their energy and environmental performance. This includes consolidating and streamlining planning and reporting requirements, updating guidance, and providing a central website with relevant resources. These efforts have led to taxpayer savings and improvements in the management of federal operations. For example, total government-wide energy use has decreased by 3% since FY 2016, and federal agencies have reduced water consumption in buildings by 4.8 billion gallons. Additionally, federal agencies have increased the number of sustainable buildings and reduced petroleum fuel use in federal vehicle fleets. The article provides specific examples of projects and initiatives that have contributed to these achievements.
