On June 26, 2001, President Biden declared a national emergency in the Western Balkans due to the threat posed by extremist violence and acts obstructing the implementation of certain agreements in the region. This national emergency was initially declared under Executive Order 13219 and subsequently amended in Executive Order 13304. The President has determined that the threat continues to exist and therefore, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, has extended the national emergency for one year, effective from June 26, 2021. This decision has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
