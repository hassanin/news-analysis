First Lady Melania Trump has launched her initiative called Be Best, which aims to support children and address the issues they face today. In addition to her speech, she agreed to distribute an educational booklet titled "Talking with Kids About Being Online" produced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2009, adding Be Best branding to promote its positive message. Despite providing background information and comments from the FTC, some media outlets have chosen to make baseless accusations against the First Lady and her initiatives instead of focusing on promoting kindness and positive efforts for children. The FTC expressed excitement about Mrs. Trump distributing the booklet and looks forward to continuing to work with her and others to promote internet safety for parents and children. The First Lady's office will continue to focus on helping children, and she encourages the media to do the same and highlight the children and programs she discussed in her speech.
