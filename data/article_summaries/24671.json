President Obama has announced an additional $155 million in humanitarian assistance for the Syrian people. This brings America's total humanitarian aid to Syria to $365 million, making the United States the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people. The aid includes food, clean water, medicine, immunizations, winter supplies, and healthcare for victims of sexual violence and the wounded. The President called on the international community to do more to help those in need and contribute to the latest UN humanitarian appeal. He also expressed confidence that the Assad regime will come to an end and that the Syrian people will have the opportunity to forge their own future.
