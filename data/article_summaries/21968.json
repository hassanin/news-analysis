The Obama Administration has outlined its commitment to veterans, service members, and military families. The Administration has focused on five priorities: ensuring the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has adequate resources, delivering promised healthcare to veterans, ending the disability claims backlog, protecting the dignity and rights of all veterans, and providing opportunities for veterans to pursue the American Dream. The VA has made progress in improving service delivery, reducing wait times, and increasing access to care. The Administration has also worked to reduce veterans' homelessness, improve employment opportunities for veterans, and support the families of veterans and service members. The Joining Forces initiative, launched by Michelle Obama and Jill Biden, has brought together public and private sectors to provide support and resources to service members, veterans, and their families.
