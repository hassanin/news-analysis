The White House has issued a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to export control regulations, which was declared on August 17, 2001, will continue beyond August 17, 2016. This continuation is due to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, which has not been renewed by Congress. The national emergency was declared under the authority provided to the President by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The notice states that the national emergency will continue for one year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
