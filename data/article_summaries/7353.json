The article is a Presidential Determination by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding electric heat pumps. The determination states that electric heat pumps are considered industrial resources, materials, or critical technology items essential to national defense. Without Presidential action, the United States industry would not be able to provide these resources in a timely manner. Therefore, the President authorizes and directs the expansion of domestic production capability for electric heat pumps to prevent any shortfall that could severely impair national defense capability. The requirements of the Defense Production Act are waived for this purpose. The determination is to be published in the Federal Register.
