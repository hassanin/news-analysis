This article discusses the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Yemen. On May 16, 2012, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Yemen and others that threatened Yemen's peace, security, and stability. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The national emergency, which was set to expire on May 16, 2017, has been extended for another year. The continuation of the national emergency is necessary due to the ongoing threat posed by the actions and policies of certain individuals in Yemen. This notice has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
