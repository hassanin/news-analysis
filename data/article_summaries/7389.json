President Biden will be announcing new actions to protect Americans and support communities and hospitals in the fight against the Omicron variant. These actions are part of the President's Winter Plan, which aims to provide maximum protection and prepare for rising cases driven by the new variant. Currently, 73% of adult Americans are fully vaccinated, and about 1 million booster shots are administered daily. Vaccines are readily available at 90,000 locations, and there are clear guidelines on masking and other preventive measures. Additionally, federal emergency medical teams are prepared to respond to surges nationwide.

The President's actions will focus on increased support for hospitals, including deploying additional medical personnel, expanding hospital capacity, and providing critical supplies. There will also be a focus on ensuring robust access to free testing, including convenient at-home tests. The administration has already taken significant steps to increase testing, with 20,000 free testing sites and four times as many at-home tests available compared to the summer. The new actions will further expand the availability of free and convenient testing options.

Furthermore, President Biden will announce additional steps to expand capacity for vaccinations and boosters. The administration has already added 10,000 more vaccination sites across the country, totaling 90,000 locations nationwide. Many sites offer walk-in appointments and vaccinations for the whole family.

Overall, these actions aim to mitigate the impact of the unvaccinated population on the healthcare system, increase access to testing, and ensure more people are vaccinated and boosted to keep individuals safe and the schools and economy open.
