The declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding. Leda M. Khoury has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
