President Donald J. Trump has informed Congress of his intent to rescind Sudan's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. This decision comes after Sudan's recent agreement to resolve claims of U.S. victims of terror and their families. In accordance with the agreement, Sudan's transitional government transferred $335 million into an escrow account for these victims. This achievement allows for the resolution of longstanding claims related to the East Africa embassy bombings, the attack on the USS Cole, and the murder of USAID employee John Granville. It is seen as a significant accomplishment for President Trump and his Administration, providing closure to many victims. This development also marks a significant step forward in the U.S.-Sudan bilateral relationship and signals a turning point for Sudan's democratic transition. The transitional government of Sudan is commended for its efforts, and support is offered to the people of Sudan as they work towards a better future. The article emphasizes the importance of Congress passing legislation to ensure that the American people can fully benefit from this policy breakthrough.
