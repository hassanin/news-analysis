During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest discussed recent data that shows the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is successfully bending the cost curve of healthcare. He mentioned that health care prices have been growing at historically slow rates, hospitals are saving billions of dollars due to fewer unpaid bills, there is greater competition and choice in the health insurance marketplace, and the average premium for employer-provided family health care coverage has only increased 3 percent this year. Earnest also discussed the growing international coalition against the Islamic State and welcomed the support from lawmakers in Europe. He mentioned that the President is open to additional steps Congress may take to indicate their support for the Presidentâ€™s strategy against ISIL. Earnest also discussed the ongoing review of the recent security breach at the White House and mentioned that the President has full confidence in the ability of the Secret Service to protect him and the White House. Finally, Earnest discussed the airstrikes against the Khorasan group and emphasized that while core al Qaeda has been decimated, there are still threats from al Qaeda affiliates around the globe.
