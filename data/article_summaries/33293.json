President Donald J. Trump has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 regarding Zimbabwe will continue beyond March 6, 2019. Despite improvements in the July 2018 national elections, post-election violence, intimidation, and bias from the electoral commission prevented the elections from being fully free and fair. President Emmerson Mnangagwa's administration has not implemented the necessary political and economic reforms to rebuild its reputation and improve its relationship with the United States. Certain members of the Zimbabwean government and other individuals continue to pose a threat to the United States' foreign policy, leading President Trump to determine that it is necessary to maintain sanctions in response to this threat.
