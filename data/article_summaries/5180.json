Biden Jr. The order declares a national emergency in response to countries of concern engaging in strategies to advance sensitive technologies and products that are critical to their military, intelligence, surveillance, or cyber-enabled capabilities.

It also outlines the duties of the Secretary and establishes a program development and reporting framework. The order defines key terms and provides general provisions for its implementation. The annex to the order lists the People's Republic of China, the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, and the Special Administrative Region of Macau as countries of concern.
