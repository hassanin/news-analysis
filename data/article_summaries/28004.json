On October 30, 2020, the United States conducted an operation in Nigeria to rescue a US citizen named Philippe Walton, who had been kidnapped from his home in Niger on October 27. Walton's captors had taken him across the Niger border into Nigeria and demanded a ransom for his release. The operation involved a small number of combat-equipped US forces who successfully completed the mission on October 31, rescuing Walton without any US military personnel being injured or killed. Walton is now safe and in the care of the US Department of State. President Donald Trump directed this action to protect US citizens and uphold national interests, exercising his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. The President is providing this report to Congress in accordance with the War Powers Resolution.
