Ambassador Roble Olhaye, the Djiboutian Ambassador to the United States, has passed away. He was the longest-serving Ambassador to the United States and a strong advocate for Djibouti and U.S.-Djiboutian relations. Ambassador Olhaye played a significant role in promoting trade between Africa and America and contributed to the long-term renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The White House offers its deepest condolences and expresses that his legacy lives on in the strong ties between Djibouti and the United States.
