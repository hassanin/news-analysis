President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency declared with respect to Yemen will continue beyond May 16, 2022. This action is in accordance with Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, which requires the President to publish a notice in the Federal Register and transmit it to Congress within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the emergency declaration. The President has determined that the actions and policies of certain former members of the Government of Yemen and others continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, hence the need to extend the national emergency.
