President Obama welcomes President Karzai's announcement of the third tranche of areas to transition to Afghan security lead. This is seen as an important step forward in achieving objectives in Afghanistan. As transition proceeds in these areas, almost 75% of the Afghan population will be living in regions where Afghan forces are in charge. The Afghan National Security Forces are also improving their capacity, and the goal of having the Afghan government fully responsible for security across the country by the end of 2014 remains on track. World leaders will soon gather at the NATO Summit in Chicago to discuss how to advance the transition process as forces move from combat to a support role. This summit will also demonstrate the enduring support for the Afghan Government and Afghan National Security Forces. President Obama looks forward to meeting with President Karzai and other leaders in Chicago to discuss these critical steps that strengthen Afghan sovereignty while responsibly winding down the war.
