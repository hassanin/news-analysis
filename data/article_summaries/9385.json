President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance in the state of New Mexico. The funding will cover debris removal and emergency protective measures related to wildfires and straight-line winds that began on April 5, 2022. Previously, federal funding was available at 75% of the total eligible costs, but it has now been increased to 100% for the first 90 days of the incident period. This increase is intended to bridge the gap until the potential passage of the Hermits Peak Fire Assistance Act, which would provide individuals with a broader range of assistance. The additional support will ensure that New Mexico has no financial limitations in addressing the ongoing wildfires, including urgent debris removal. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
