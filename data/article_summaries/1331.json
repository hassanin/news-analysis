White House officials, including Susan Rice, Cedric Richmond, Erika Moritsugu, and Howard Ou, hosted a meeting with Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NH/PI) leaders to discuss the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to combat anti-Asian racism, xenophobia, hate, and violence. The meeting comes in light of the increasing incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes and the recent shootings in Atlanta and Indianapolis that specifically targeted women of Asian descent and Sikh Americans. The White House also engaged philanthropic and business leaders, such as the Asian American Foundation, to discuss their role in supporting AA and NH/PI advocacy, power, and representation. During the meeting, the participants announced a private funding commitment of over $1 billion to combat anti-AAPI hate and promote research and public education about AA and NH/PI communities. This commitment is the largest philanthropic effort in history focused on supporting these communities. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris also met with these leaders to emphasize their administration's commitment to AA and NH/PI communities and to condemn hate crimes while promoting racial equity.
