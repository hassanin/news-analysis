President Biden is focused on combating COVID-19 and preparing for future biological threats. The United States must invest in science, technology, and core capabilities to protect against potential pandemics. The cost of prevention is far less than the cost of a pandemic in terms of lives and economy. The President has ordered a review of national biopreparedness policies and established the National Security Council Directorate on Global Health Security and Biodefense. A plan called "American Pandemic Preparedness: Transforming our Capabilities" has been released, outlining five key areas of focus: transforming medical defenses, ensuring situational awareness, strengthening public health systems, building core capabilities, and managing the mission with seriousness and accountability. This plan aims to improve vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, enhance early warning and monitoring, strengthen public health systems, and ensure equity and access for all Americans. The transformation of capabilities will take time, so it is important to start now. This effort requires a systematic and shared vision across the government, similar to past ambitious endeavors like the Apollo mission. It is also an opportunity to strengthen the public health system and address health inequities. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting the public health workforce and preventing future inequities. The biopreparedness review will continue to learn from COVID-19 and develop strategies to build back better in the United States and globally.
