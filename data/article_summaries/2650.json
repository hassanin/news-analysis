President Biden will be announcing the final rule implementing the American Rescue Plan's Special Financial Assistance program at Max S. Hayes High School in Cleveland, Ohio. This program aims to protect workers in multiemployer pension plans who were facing significant cuts to their benefits. Before the American Rescue Plan, workers and retirees in over 200 multiemployer pension plans were at risk of not receiving their full benefits. These plans are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which was projected to become insolvent by 2026. The Special Financial Assistance program will provide relief to struggling multiemployer pension plans and ensure that families facing benefit cuts receive their full benefits. Under this program, financially struggling plans can apply to the PBGC for assistance. The Final Rule includes important policy changes that will ensure the solvency of all plans receiving Special Financial Assistance through at least 2051.
