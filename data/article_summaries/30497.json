President Donald Trump will travel to Norfolk, Virginia on March 28 to bid farewell to the hospital ship USNS COMFORT as it departs for New York City to assist with the COVID-19 response. The ship will sail earlier than planned to help ease the burden on New York City hospitals. Over 1200 medical personnel and critical supplies will be on board to provide care for non-COVID-19 patients and support the city's medical community. This deployment follows the earlier deployment of the USNS MERCY to Los Angeles. The USNS COMFORT's mission is considered one of the most important in its history.
