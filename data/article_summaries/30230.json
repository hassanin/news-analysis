The U.S. labor market has shown impressive gains during the Trump Administration. In February, nonfarm payroll employment increased by 273,000, surpassing market expectations by nearly 100,000 jobs. January and December payroll growth estimates were also revised upward by a total of 85,000 jobs. Over the past three months, the U.S. economy has added 105,000 more jobs than projected for the entire year. The strong job growth indicates a strong and resilient economy, especially considering the historically low unemployment rate. The Trump administration has been successful in bringing workers off the labor market's sidelines, with the average share of new workers coming from outside of the labor force being 72.6 percent over the past three months. Wage growth has also been significant, with nominal average hourly earnings increasing at a 3 percent rate year-over-year. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent, a 50-year low, with the female unemployment rate reaching a 66-year low of 3.4 percent in February. Women have seen impressive gains in employment, making up the majority of payroll employment and receiving 71.2 percent of new jobs. The labor market is expected to continue breaking records throughout the year, with more jobs being created and workers coming off the sidelines.
