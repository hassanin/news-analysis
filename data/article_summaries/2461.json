Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani's visit to Baghdad on June 15 is welcomed by the United States, as it supports Iraq's sovereignty, independence, and integration into the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and broader Arab region. Iraq's progress towards energy self-sufficiency, particularly through connecting its energy grid to the GCC's and Jordan's grids, is also supported by the US. President Biden's visit to the Middle East last year laid the foundation for these infrastructure projects, which are now being facilitated and supported by the US. Furthermore, a significant project signed earlier this year with TotalEnergies, along with US and Qatari companies, focuses on natural gas capture to meet the needs of the Iraqi people and reduce emissions. The active support of Sheikh al-Thani, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' al-Sudani, other regional leaders, and the Iraqi people is appreciated. The participation of Kurdistan Region President Nechirvan Barzani in these discussions is also welcomed to enhance coordination between Baghdad and the Iraqi Kurdistan region.
