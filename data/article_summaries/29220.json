The United States and Poland have reaffirmed their commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and plan to enhance their defense relationship. The United States intends to increase its military presence in Poland by about 1,000 additional personnel, focusing on defense and deterrence capabilities. Poland, in turn, will provide infrastructure and support for the increased US forces. The two countries also share values such as democracy, freedom, and individual rights. They plan to establish various military capabilities in Poland, including a division headquarters, a combat training center, an intelligence squadron, an aerial port, and special operations forces capability. Both countries aim to conclude agreements and arrangements to strengthen defense cooperation and consult on force posture adjustments.
