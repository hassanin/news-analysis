The White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, released a statement regarding the Social Security Economic Recovery Payment. Many seniors are struggling due to the economic downturn, with their savings being impacted. The Social Security Administration has announced that there will be no cost of living adjustment for social security benefits for a second year, emphasizing the challenges faced by seniors. In response, President Obama is advocating for a $250 Economic Recovery Payment to be given to seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities. Last year, around 56 million individuals, including 50 million Social Security beneficiaries, benefited from the first Economic Recovery Payment, which was implemented under the Recovery Act. Speaker Pelosi has expressed her intention to bring the new Economic Recovery Payment to a vote, and the White House urges members of Congress from both political parties to support seniors, veterans, and individuals with disabilities who rely on these benefits.
