The White House has released a fact sheet highlighting the economic benefits of America's national parks on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the creation of the national park system. The fact sheet emphasizes the importance of protecting public lands and waters as they contribute to the economy by attracting visitors from all over the world and supporting a $646 billion national outdoor economy. In 2015, more than 305 million people visited national parks, spending $16.9 billion in nearby communities. The fact sheet also mentions the Obama Administration's efforts to measure and promote the value of the outdoor economy, increase access to outdoor recreation, and protect public lands. It provides an overview of the economic impact of national parks in each state, including visitor spending, jobs supported, and state economic output.
