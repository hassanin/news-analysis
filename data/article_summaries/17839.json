This article discusses Executive Order 13519, which establishes the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force in the United States. The task force is led by the Department of Justice and consists of senior-level officials from various departments and agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, Department of Commerce, Department of Labor, and more. The task force's mission is to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes and violations relating to the current financial crisis and economic recovery efforts. It also aims to recover the proceeds of such crimes and ensure just and effective punishment for those involved. The task force will provide advice to the Attorney General, make recommendations for enhancing cooperation among authorities responsible for investigating financial crimes, and coordinate law enforcement operations. It will also conduct outreach with financial institutions, government agencies, and other interested parties to foster greater coordination in detecting and prosecuting financial fraud. The Department of Justice will provide administrative support and funding for the task force. The order replaces and continues the work of the Corporate Fraud Task Force created in 2002. The task force will terminate when directed by the President or the Attorney General.
