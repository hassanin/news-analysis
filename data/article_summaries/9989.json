The White House has announced that President Obama will not be attending a U.S.-Russia Summit in early September due to a lack of recent progress in the bilateral agenda. The statement acknowledges previous achievements in the President's first term, such as the New START Treaty and cooperation on Afghanistan, Iran, and North Korea. However, issues including missile defense and arms control, trade and commercial relations, global security, and human rights and civil society have seen little progress in the last year. The decision to grant Edward Snowden temporary asylum by Russia also played a role in assessing the current state of the bilateral relationship. Instead of the summit, Secretaries Hagel and Kerry will meet with their Russian counterparts in Washington to discuss how to make progress moving forward. The President still plans to attend the G-20 Summit in St. Petersburg on September 5-6.
