The conflict between Israel and Hamas remains a top priority for President Biden, who is actively engaged in ensuring that the Palestinian people receive urgently needed humanitarian aid. The President has been making calls and holding meetings with various leaders to address the situation. The first convoys of humanitarian assistance have reached Palestinians in need in Gaza, and efforts to provide aid will continue. The supplemental funding request made by the President includes resources for national security and support for allies in their fight against tyrants and terrorists. The administration is urging Congress to provide additional resources to address these needs. Admiral John Kirby from the National Security Council answered questions on various topics, including the release of American hostages, rocket attacks by Iranian-backed proxy groups, and the situation in Gaza. The administration is focused on providing support to Israel, ensuring humanitarian assistance flows, and working towards a peaceful resolution.
