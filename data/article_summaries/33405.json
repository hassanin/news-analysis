On August 4, 1790, Congress authorized the formation of a group of vessels to protect the commerce and revenue streams of the newly formed United States. This group, known as the United States Coast Guard, has since evolved into the world's premier maritime governance, security, and safety service. The Coast Guard, with over 40,000 active duty and civilian members, as well as 7,000 reserve members, plays a crucial role in securing and advancing the nation's preparedness, response, and economic prosperity. They defend borders, rescue mariners, facilitate commerce, and combat drug smugglers and human traffickers. The Coast Guard has been involved in counter narcotics operations, resulting in over 1,000 arrests and the interception of 120 metric tons of narcotics. On the 230th birthday of the Coast Guard, the First Lady and President send their best wishes and gratitude to all Coast Guard service members and their families for their service and sacrifice.
