President Trump's infrastructure plan aims to create more jobs by strengthening the nation's infrastructure, including modernizing roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports. The plan also focuses on investing in workforce education to provide Americans with the necessary skills for these jobs. It proposes expanding federal Pell Grant eligibility to high-quality, short-term programs, reforming career and technical education programs, and updating the federal work-study program to support workforce and career-oriented opportunities for low-income undergraduate students. Additionally, the plan calls on states to accept workers with out-of-state licenses to reduce barriers and increase mobility for American workers. Overall, the plan aims to bring America's infrastructure into the 21st century while creating new job opportunities and preparing the American workforce for sustainable careers.
