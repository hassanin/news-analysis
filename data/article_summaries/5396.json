President Biden is set to visit West Columbia, where Enphase Energy is announcing new manufacturing investments and a partnership with Flex, resulting in up to 600 new jobs in South Carolina. This is thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Biden introduced. The act has mobilized companies to invest over $500 billion in manufacturing and clean energy in the United States since the beginning of his administration. South Carolina alone has seen $11 billion in such investments, with $2.6 billion in infrastructure funding already awarded by the Biden-Harris Administration. Enphase Energy is joining the list of companies beginning clean energy manufacturing operations in the US, creating 1,800 new jobs nationwide, including up to 600 in South Carolina. However, if Republicans in Congress had their way, South Carolina would have missed out on these investments and opportunities. They also would have lost out on over $2.6 billion in infrastructure funding and nearly $1 billion in funding for high-speed internet.
