The first listening session of the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable (WH-LAIR) was convened by Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, White House Counsel Dana Remus, and Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta. They were joined by panelists and administration officials to discuss access to justice challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to address pandemic-related challenges, such as preventing evictions, expanding access to legal representation and the courts, and ensuring federal resources reach those in need. The WH-LAIR will continue to meet and explore ways to incorporate legal services into supportive services provided by the federal government, and enhance access to justice for individuals and families.
