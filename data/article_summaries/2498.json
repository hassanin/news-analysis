This memorandum, issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., addresses the issue of women's access to healthcare, both in the United States and globally. It highlights the restrictions on Federal funds that have made it difficult for women to obtain necessary healthcare, particularly in relation to reproductive health. The memorandum mentions the Title X program, which provides funding for family planning services to low-income patients, and the changes made to regulations governing the program in 2019. These changes have resulted in the termination of funding for many women's healthcare providers and have made it harder for women to receive complete medical information. 

The memorandum also discusses the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which prohibits NGOs that receive Federal funds from using those funds for abortions or to promote abortions. It mentions the "Mexico City Policy," which was introduced by President Reagan in 1984 and has been rescinded and reinstated by subsequent presidents. President Trump expanded this policy to apply to all executive departments and agencies, limiting global health assistance and hindering efforts to address health challenges. The memorandum revokes the Mexico City Policy and directs various departments and agencies to review and consider suspending, revising, or rescinding regulations that impose undue restrictions on Federal funds or women's access to medical information. It also instructs the Secretary of State to withdraw support from the Geneva Consensus Declaration and resume funding to the United Nations Population Fund. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of supporting women's health needs globally, including sexual and reproductive health and rights.
