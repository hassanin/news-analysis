President Biden has signed an Executive Order (E.O.) to address the ongoing national emergency in the Western Balkans. The order provides additional sanctions authorities to target individuals who threaten peace, security, stability, or territorial integrity in the region, as well as those involved in serious human rights abuses. The E.O. expands the designation criteria to address challenges such as corruption, which undermines key institutions and international agreements. The United States is committed to promoting accountability and combating impunity for significant corruption in the Western Balkans and globally. Corruption damages foreign policy, national security, and economic health, and allows strategic adversaries to undermine democracy and effective governance. The E.O. blocks the property and interests in property of designated individuals within the United States and prohibits transactions with them. Additionally, sanctioned individuals will be banned from entering the United States or holding a U.S. visa. The Biden Administration is dedicated to ensuring the security and political stability of the region and will continue to address its challenges. The Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State, will update the list of individuals subject to sanctions under this order.
