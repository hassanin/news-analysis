The article discusses the plan to bring the U.S. war in Afghanistan to a responsible end. Since 2001, the U.S. and Afghanistan have been working together to respond to threats and help Afghanistan become a secure, democratic, and prosperous country. The U.S. has been gradually drawing down its troops in Afghanistan since 2009, with another 22,000 troops set to come home by the end of 2014. By the end of 2016, the U.S. will have a normal embassy presence in Kabul, with a focus on training Afghan forces and supporting counterterrorism operations. The Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) have taken the lead in providing security for the country, with the support of the international community. The U.S. and Afghanistan have a strategic partnership agreement that outlines their commitments to each other, including supporting Afghanistan's social and economic development, security, and institutions. The international community has also pledged financial support to Afghanistan through 2017. The article also mentions the political transition in Afghanistan, with the presidential elections taking place in April. The U.S. supports a fair and Afghan-led election process and a peace and reconciliation process to end violence and ensure lasting stability. Afghanistan has made significant economic progress, with rapid economic growth and improvements in social indicators. However, challenges remain, and Afghanistan will need continued international assistance to sustain its gains and meet its development goals.
