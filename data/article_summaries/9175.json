The Fifth Circuit has issued a decision that invalidates the FDA's judgment on when and how a medicine is available to Americans. This decision threatens the availability of medication for various conditions, including chemotherapy, asthma, blood pressure, and insulin. It also limits access to medication abortion, which could lead to a nationwide abortion ban. The Justice Department is seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court. President Biden and the Administration are committed to protecting access to medication abortion and women's health.
