Vice President Biden has announced that the Administration has issued a 'Dear Colleague' letter that withdraws a 2005 interpretation of Title IX policy. Title IX mandates that any educational institution receiving federal funding cannot discriminate on the basis of sex. The 2005 policy's compliance standards were criticized for being inadequate and inconsistent with Title IX's goals. The announcement reverses this interpretation and returns to a more thorough test for assessing compliance. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) will now evaluate multiple indicators to determine athletic interests and abilities. The 'Dear Colleague' letter also provides recommendations for effective procedures for collecting, maintaining, and evaluating information on students' interests and abilities.
