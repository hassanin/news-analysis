President Trump is set to sign two new Executive Orders that aim to level the playing field for American families and small businesses while shedding light on the federal bureaucracy. The first order, called "Transparency and Fairness," protects Americans from secret or unlawful bureaucratic interpretations of rules and unfair penalties for non-compliance. The second order, "Bringing Guidance out of the Darkness," prevents agencies from bypassing public input on government rules that can limit freedom. The Trump administration is committed to making government agencies transparent and accountable, which not only benefits the economy but also saves the average American household $3,100 in the coming years. The administration has been focused on rolling back regulations since Trump took office, surpassing his goal of eliminating two regulations for every new one. In FY 2017, 22 regulations were rolled back for every new one, and in FY 2018, 12 rules were rolled back for every new rule.
