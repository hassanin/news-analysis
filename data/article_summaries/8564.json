The article discusses a notice sent by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the continuation of a national emergency declaration concerning the threat from securities investments that finance certain companies of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The national emergency, which was declared in Executive Order 13959 on November 12, 2020, and expanded in Executive Order 14032 on June 3, 2021, is set to continue beyond November 12, 2023. The justification for this continuation is that the PRC utilizes United States capital to support the development and modernization of its military, intelligence, and security apparatuses, posing a direct threat to the United States. The PRC's military-industrial complex, which includes civilian Chinese companies compelled to support military and intelligence activities, raises capital by selling securities to U.S. investors and engages in other acts to ensure access to U.S. capital. The President believes that this complex, along with the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declaration is deemed necessary to address these threats.
