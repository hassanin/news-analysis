The White House has expressed its pleasure over President Bingu wa Mutharika's decision to pardon Tiwonge Chimbalanga and Steven Monjeza in Malawi. The statement emphasizes that these individuals were not criminals and calls for an end to the persecution and criminalization of sexual orientation and gender identity. The White House hopes that this pardon will lead to a new dialogue in Malawi, reflecting the country's history of tolerance and advocating for LGBTQ+ rights globally.
