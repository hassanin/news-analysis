The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed a new rule that would require cable and satellite TV providers to disclose the all-in price for their services upfront. This is part of the administration's efforts to lower the cost of living for the middle class by cracking down on companies' use of hidden fees. These fees, disguised as "broadcast TV" or "regional sports" fees, do not provide any additional services but can increase customer bills by almost 25% of the base service price. The FCC's proposal aims to increase transparency, allow consumers to compare prices between providers, and promote competition. The administration is committed to reducing junk fees to bring down costs for working families who are hit the hardest by these additional charges.
