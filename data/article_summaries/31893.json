President Donald J. Trump has issued a notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12978, which targets significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, is to continue beyond October 21, 2017. The President argues that the circumstances that led to the declaration in 1995 still exist, as the actions of these traffickers pose a significant threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. The President believes that these traffickers are responsible for an extreme level of violence, corruption, and harm both within the United States and internationally.
