The economy is performing well with strong job creation, rising wages, and high confidence due to President Trump's pro-growth agenda. In October, job growth exceeded expectations with 250,000 new jobs added, and year-over-year wage gains surpassed 3% for the first time since the Great Recession. Unemployment remained at a low rate of 3.7%. Additionally, consumer confidence reached an 18-year high in October, indicating a positive outlook for the economy. Medicaid enrollment declined for the first time since 2007, suggesting that the strong economy has boosted income for low-income Americans. The US economy also grew at a faster pace than expected in the third quarter, with a 3.5% increase in gross domestic product. The tax cuts implemented by President Trump have contributed to the growth of the manufacturing sector, with many companies investing in new facilities, equipment, and employees.
