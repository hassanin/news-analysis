The American Rescue Plan (ARP) has made significant investments in expanding health care coverage and reducing costs for millions of Americans. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical shortcomings in our health care and health insurance systems, and the ARP has addressed these gaps by providing more affordable coverage to those who have lost their jobs in recent years. The Biden Administration has released a state-by-state breakdown of health insurance enrollment changes during this year's Open Enrollment Period (OEP). A total of 14.5 million Americans enrolled in a Marketplace plan through HealthCare.Gov or a State-Based Marketplace during the 2022 OEP, representing a 21% increase from the previous year. These enrollment increases are a result of the expansions of cost-saving subsidies in the American Rescue Plan. The ARP has also provided significant cost savings for individuals and families, with an average of $800 per person saved last year. Additionally, 5.8 million new consumers enrolled in health care coverage during the 2021 Special Enrollment and Open Enrollment periods. In contrast, between 2016 and 2019, 3.6 million Americans lost their coverage. Overall, the ARP has successfully reduced the cost of health care coverage for many individuals and families across the country.
