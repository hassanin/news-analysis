The article discusses an executive order issued by President Barack Obama on January 30, 2009, regarding the nondisplacement of qualified workers under service contracts. The order states that when a service contract expires and a new contract is awarded for the same service at the same location, the successor contractor should offer employment to the predecessor's employees. This helps maintain continuity of services and ensures that the government benefits from an experienced workforce. The order applies to service contracts covered by the Service Contract Act of 1965, except for certain exclusions. The order also allows for exemptions if it is determined that the requirements would not serve the purpose or impair the government's ability to procure services efficiently. The Secretary of Labor is responsible for enforcing compliance with the order, and sanctions can be imposed for non-compliance. The order also includes a contract clause that should be included in solicitations and service contracts. The article concludes by stating that the order revokes a previous executive order and provides general provisions for its implementation.
