The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) commends Congress for passing legislation that will help combat the opioid crisis. The reauthorization of the ONDCP is seen as a positive step towards keeping illicit drugs out of communities and providing treatment for those struggling with addiction. The ONDCP thanks Members of Congress for their bipartisan effort to prevent drug use, treat addiction locally, and stop the flow of drugs into communities.
