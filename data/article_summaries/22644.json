President Obama has issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency with respect to the situation in Burundi. The order is aimed at individuals within the government and armed groups who contribute to the turmoil in Burundi, including threats to peace and security, actions that undermine democratic institutions, and human rights abuses. The order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to impose sanctions on individuals and entities involved in these activities. The order also blocks the property and interests in property of those sanctioned, imposes visa restrictions, and prohibits U.S. persons from doing business with them. The order specifically names four individuals who have been listed for sanctions, including the Minister of Public Security, the Deputy Director-General of the National Police, the former Chief of Burundi Intelligence Service, and the former Minister of Defense. These individuals have been implicated in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Burundi, human rights abuses, and the obstruction of democratic processes.
