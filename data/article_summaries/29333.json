The United States strongly condemns a recent terrorist attack in Afghanistan, claimed by the Taliban, that resulted in the deaths and injuries of Afghan civilians and security personnel. The attack involved a vehicle bombing and gun assault on an Afghan defense facility, causing damage to nearby civic and cultural centers and a primary school. Numerous young children were also injured. This attack highlights the Taliban's disregard for the Afghan people and their repeated pleas for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
