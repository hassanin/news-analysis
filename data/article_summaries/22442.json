Connecticut Governor-Elect Dan Malloy expressed his support for a deal being considered in Washington, DC that would extend unemployment benefits and the existing middle-class tax cuts. He acknowledged that compromise is necessary in legislation and stated that he can support the framework of this package, especially for the benefits it would provide to unemployed workers in Connecticut and the extension of middle-class tax cuts. Malloy also emphasized the importance of the House of Representatives' involvement in the process but ultimately called for the package to be passed and signed into law.
