President Donald Trump has praised the Senate for passing the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S.2155). The President supports the bill and has expressed his intention to sign it into law. The bill aims to provide relief from the Dodd-Frank Act for community banks and credit unions, with the goal of promoting lending and economic growth without compromising the financial system. The bill seeks to tailor regulations to prevent excessive regulation from negatively impacting local and regional banks and their ability to serve their communities. The President is open to discussing any further revisions that the House may propose, with the aim of achieving bipartisan, pro-growth relief from Dodd-Frank.
