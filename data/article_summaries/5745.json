The memorandum discusses the severe energy supply interruption caused by Russia's war against Ukraine. The International Energy Agency Governing Board agreed to release petroleum reserves, and the United States committed to selling 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Russian Federation's continued attacks on Ukrainian territory and the resulting devastation to the civilian population have led to sanctions and reduced economic engagement with Russian businesses. Based on advice from the Secretary of Energy, it is determined that a drawdown and sale of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is necessary due to a national energy supply shortage resulting from an interruption in the supply of imported petroleum products. The Secretary is authorized to conduct the sale to the highest qualified bidder, but can cancel it if the circumstances change. The memorandum is signed by Joseph R. Biden Jr.
