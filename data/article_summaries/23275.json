In this press briefing, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs announces that President Obama has invited key partners in the Middle East peace process to the White House in the coming weeks. The President will meet separately with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority to discuss ways to strengthen partnerships and achieve peace in the region. Gibbs also addresses questions about the possibility of prosecuting individuals involved in CIA interrogation practices. He states that the determination of whether a law was broken will be made by the Department of Justice, and that the President believes that those who acted in good faith based on legal advice should not be prosecuted.
