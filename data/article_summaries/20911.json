FEMA is authorized to provide necessary equipment and resources to mitigate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance, will be funded at 75 percent by the federal government. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-3272.
