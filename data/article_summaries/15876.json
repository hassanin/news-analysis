The article discusses the passing of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010 by the House and Senate. This bill aims to expand and improve upon the Post 9/11 GI Bill, providing better benefits for veterans in a fiscally responsible manner. The Act allows veterans to use their benefits for vocational and on-the-job training, extends eligibility to National Guardsmen activated for domestic assistance, provides additional assistance for purchasing books to Active Duty troops, and grants more time for severely injured veterans and their caregivers to use their benefits. The President expresses appreciation for the efforts of Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Akaka, Ranking Member Burr, and Senator Webb, and states that the Administration will continue to work with Congress to further enhance the program and support veterans.
