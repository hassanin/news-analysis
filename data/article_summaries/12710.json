President Obama commends the Oregon Legislature and Governor Kate Brown for raising the state's minimum wage. He highlights that since 2013, 18 states and the District of Columbia have taken action to increase their minimum wage, which will benefit hardworking Americans and support workers trying to make ends meet. The President emphasizes that over half of the states now guarantee a wage higher than the federal minimum, but urges Congress to increase the federal minimum wage to keep up with the rest of the country. Until Congress acts, he will continue to encourage states, cities, counties, and companies to independently support hardworking families.
