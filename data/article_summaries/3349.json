The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will release over $385 million to states for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to help families and individuals with their home energy costs, including summer cooling. This funding is in addition to the $4.5 billion provided by the American Rescue Plan and the first installment of a five-year, $500 million investment from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In total, the Biden-Harris Administration is providing over $8.3 billion in LIHEAP assistance, the largest investment in a single year since the program's establishment in 1981.

President Biden is traveling to the Pacific Northwest, where record heat was experienced last year, to highlight actions taken to lower costs for families, including home energy costs. HHS announced the final state-by-state allocation of LIHEAP funding, with Oregon receiving an additional $3.8 million and Washington receiving an additional $6.5 million.

The American Rescue Plan also provided resources such as Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) programs and the Homeowners Assistance Fund to address home energy costs. State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds can also be used to provide energy relief to families.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invested $3.5 billion in the Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program to reduce energy costs for low-income households by improving energy efficiency. The Biden-Harris Administration is also taking actions to save families money through energy efficiency standards, such as proposing new standards for appliances like air conditioners.

The announcement emphasizes the administration's commitment to distributing these resources swiftly and equitably. Households in need of assistance can find resources in their area through EnergyHelp.us or by calling the National Energy Assistance Referral hotline.
