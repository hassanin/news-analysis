President Obama has announced that the General Services Administration (GSA) will use funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to purchase 17,600 new, fuel-efficient vehicles for the government fleet by June 1, 2009. This move is aimed at increasing demand for American auto companies and supporting the struggling auto industry during the economic crisis. The GSA will spend $285 million on the purchase, including 2,500 hybrid sedans. The strategy is expected to reduce gasoline consumption by 1.3 million gallons per year and prevent 26 million pounds of CO2 emissions. Additionally, $15 million will be dedicated to pilot programs for advanced technology vehicles in the GSA Fleet. The goal is to have each vehicle purchased under this strategy be more fuel-efficient than the one it replaces, with an overall goal of at least a 10 percent increase in fuel efficiency for the entire procurement. This is part of the President's commitment to supporting the auto industry and increasing auto demand during this period of restructuring.
