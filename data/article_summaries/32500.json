President Donald J. Trump has issued a memorandum regarding the certification for certain records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In the memorandum, Trump explains that the American people deserve access to these records to be fully informed about the event. However, certain information has been temporarily withheld from release due to national security, law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns. The Archivist of the United States has reviewed the proposed withholdings and believes they are consistent with the standards of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. Trump agrees with the Archivist's recommendation and orders agencies to re-review the redactions over the next three years. If any information no longer warrants continued withholding, it should be disclosed. The memorandum certifies that the information within the records proposed for continued postponement shall be withheld from full public disclosure until no later than October 26, 2021. Any agency seeking further postponement beyond this date must provide a specific basis for their conclusion. The Archivist will recommend to the President whether continued withholding is warranted after October 26, 2021. The memorandum is authorized to be published in the Federal Register.
