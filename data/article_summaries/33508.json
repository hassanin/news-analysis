The Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, delivered a speech on the state of the U.S. economy. He discussed the struggles of the U.S. economy in the past, particularly slow growth in real GDP and labor productivity. Hassett emphasized the importance of capital deepening to labor productivity growth and highlighted the negative contribution of capital deepening during the post-2009 expansion. He also mentioned the impact of tax policy on business investment and cited recent research that supports the idea that a decline in the cost of capital raises the demand for capital services. Hassett discussed the positive effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on economic growth, citing upward revisions in growth forecasts and increased business fixed investment. He also mentioned the global impact of U.S. tax changes, suggesting that they may have large effects on global growth. Hassett concluded by stating that the fundamentals of the American economy are looking strong.
