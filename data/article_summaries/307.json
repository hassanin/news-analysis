President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed September 2021 as National Recovery Month in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on those struggling with substance use disorder, and this month aims to celebrate those who have achieved recovery and offer support to those still struggling. The theme for this year's National Recovery Month is "Recovery is For Everyone: Every Person, Every Family, Every Community," highlighting that recovery is possible for all Americans. The administration is committed to supporting individuals and their families throughout their recovery journey and making treatment and recovery support services accessible to all. The American Rescue Plan has allocated nearly $4 billion to strengthen mental health and substance use disorder services. Efforts will also be made to expand employment opportunities for people in recovery and create recovery-ready workplace policies and cultures. The administration acknowledges that underserved communities, including racially-diverse, Tribal, and rural communities, often lack access to support services for addiction. Addressing this disparity and advancing equity in public health and criminal justice approaches to drug policy is a priority. By making support and service systems available to everyone and embracing those seeking to rejoin and contribute to society, sustained recovery can be within reach for more people. National Recovery Month also recognizes and thanks healthcare providers who have delivered essential care and hope to those in need. The resilience and courage of the recovery community serve as a reminder that recovery is possible for everyone. The proclamation calls upon citizens, government agencies, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other groups to take action in promoting recovery and improving the nation's health.
