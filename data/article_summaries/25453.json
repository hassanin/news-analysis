On July 10, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order regarding the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), a component of the Department of Justice. The order aimed to provide appointment authority to the USMS, allowing them to hire high-quality Deputy U.S. Marshals and Criminal Investigators. The order placed these positions in Schedule B of the excepted service, exempting them from open competition or usual competitive examining procedures. However, appointments to these positions cannot be made to positions of a confidential or policy-determining character or to positions in the Senior Executive Service. After three years of satisfactory service, Deputy U.S. Marshals and Criminal Investigators appointed under Schedule B may be converted non-competitively to career appointments, subject to qualifications and requirements established by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. The order also included general provisions, stating that it does not impair existing authorities or functions of executive departments or agencies and that it is subject to applicable law and appropriations.
