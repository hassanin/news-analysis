President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued a letter to the Congress of the United States, informing them that he has authorized the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to order certain units and individual members of the Ready Reserve to active duty. This action is being taken in response to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14059, which imposes sanctions on foreign persons involved in the global illicit drug trade. The purpose of this authorization is to enable the Department of Defense to provide support to the Department of Homeland Security in addressing international drug trafficking along the Southwest Border. The letter includes a copy of the Executive Order issued by President Biden.
