In this article, President Joe Biden proclaims December 2021 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month.

The article mentions that alcohol-impaired driving alone leads to over 10,000 deaths annually. The administration is committed to reducing impaired driving by implementing new prevention technologies in vehicles and supporting innovative strategies. They aim to identify and support individuals with substance use disorders, increase impaired driving risk screening, and provide access to evidence-based treatment and recovery support services. The administration is also running national media campaigns to raise awareness about the effects of impairment on driving ability. While technology may offer solutions in the future, individual responsibility is crucial in preventing impaired driving. The article concludes by urging Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired driving and appreciating law enforcement officers who work to keep impaired drivers off the roadways.
