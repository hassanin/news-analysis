President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Connecticut due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to affected individuals and communities. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and hazard mitigation measures. Albert Lewis has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. Damage surveys are still ongoing, and additional forms of assistance may be designated as assessments are completed.
