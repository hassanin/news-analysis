The White House has released a press call previewing President Obama's upcoming trip to Greece, Germany, and Peru. The trip is intended to show solidarity with European allies, support economic growth and global cooperation, and discuss ongoing issues such as the fight against ISIS, migration, counterterrorism, and the situation in Syria and Ukraine. In Greece, President Obama will express support for the country's efforts to balance its budget and reform its economy, and will discuss ongoing structural reforms. In Germany, he will meet with Chancellor Merkel and other European leaders to discuss a range of issues including counterterrorism, migration, and the recent U.S. election. In Peru, he will attend the APEC Summit and meet with leaders from countries in the Asia Pacific region to discuss economic and security issues, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. President Obama plans to fully brief the incoming administration on the Iran deal and the Paris agreement, but acknowledges that the new administration will make its own determinations on these policies. He will also emphasize the importance of a smooth transition and the need for the United States to continue playing a leadership role in the world.
