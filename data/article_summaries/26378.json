The future of American commercial space activity is looking bright, with space entrepreneurs planning travel to Mars and using the moon as a refueling and restocking location for Mars-bound rockets. The global space economy is rapidly growing and could become a multitrillion-dollar industry. Public-private partnerships are allowing American rockets to carry NASA astronauts into space once again, and space tourism could be just a year away. Earth-based mining companies may face competition from mining resources on asteroids and other planets. The United States is leading in space once again, but faces competition from Russia, China, and other countries. The government needs to update its regulations and create frameworks that enable, rather than stifle, the industry. President Trump recently signed Space Policy Directive 2 to modernize space policies, including the creation of a new office to oversee commercial space activities. The Department of Commerce will have a greater role in regulating and promoting space activity to support American companies and ensure American leadership in space.
