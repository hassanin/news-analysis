First Lady Michelle Obama has announced the launch of Let's Move! Active Schools, a collaboration aimed at bringing physical activity back to America's schools. The program provides schools with the tools and resources to create active environments where students get 60 minutes of physical activity before, during, and after the school day. The goal is to engage 50,000 schools in this program over the next five years. The managing organizations of the program are the President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition, the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation & Dance, and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation. Funding and resources for the program are being provided by NIKE, Inc., the GENYOUth Foundation, ChildObesity180, Kaiser Permanente, and the General Mills Foundation. NIKE, Inc. will invest $50 million over the next five years to increase physical activity in schools and communities. Other organizations are committing over $20 million to help schools engage all students in quality physical activity. The U.S. Department of Education will also support physical and nutrition education in schools by reallocating its $80 million Carol M. White Physical Education Program to prioritize schools most in need. Let's Move! Active Schools combines elements of existing programs and provides customized support for schools to encourage physical activity. The program encourages school staff, families, and communities to work together to make physical education a part of every student's day.
