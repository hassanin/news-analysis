The United States strongly condemns the recent terrorist attacks in Turkey, including an attack on a police headquarters and an attack on the convoy of the leader of Turkey's main opposition party. The PKK has claimed responsibility for the police headquarters attack, which is part of a troubling trend of increasing violence by the PKK in Turkey. The US expresses its condolences to the families of the victims and wishes a speedy recovery to those injured. The US remains committed to supporting Turkey in its fight against terrorism and is working closely with Turkish authorities to address this issue. Turkey is an important NATO ally and partner that has been targeted by terrorist attacks against both security personnel and civilians.
