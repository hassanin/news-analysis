First Lady Melania Trump has announced that Stephanie Grisham will be returning to the East Wing full time as Chief of Staff and Spokesperson. Grisham previously served in the administration and is described as a mainstay and true leader. The First Lady expressed excitement about welcoming her back and believes she will excel in her new role. Grisham thanked Lindsay Reynolds for her service over the past three years and stated that her replacements will be announced soon. Reynolds resigned earlier in the week to spend more time with her family. Grisham will begin her role immediately and will assist with a smooth transition in the West Wing for as long as necessary.
