President Obama has declared a major disaster in Puerto Rico due to the impact of Hurricane Irene. Federal aid will be provided to supplement recovery efforts in the affected areas. Assistance will include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and businesses recover. Federal funding will also be available for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures for the entire commonwealth will also be supported. Justo Hern√°ndez has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional municipalities may be eligible for assistance. Residents and business owners can apply for assistance online or by phone.
