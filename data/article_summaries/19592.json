President Obama has announced that the United States intends to contribute $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The GCF aims to reduce carbon pollution and strengthen resilience in developing countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable. The US joins other countries, including Mexico, Korea, Germany, France, Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland, in pledging financial support to the GCF. The GCF will finance investments that help countries reduce carbon pollution and adapt to climate change, leveraging public and private finance to avoid catastrophic risks. The US contribution builds on previous commitments to support climate action and demonstrates a continuation of bipartisan resolve. The GCF will also stimulate global markets in clean energy technologies, creating opportunities for US entrepreneurs and manufacturers. The GCF was established in 2009 and is an independent legal entity that will make independent funding and operational decisions. The US intends to contribute $3 billion to the initial fundraising effort, not exceeding 30% of total confirmed pledges. The US expects that its share will decline over time as more countries contribute to the GCF. A significant portion of US support will be targeted at the GCF's Private Sector Facility, recognizing the importance of mobilizing private sector financing in developing countries. The US believes that the GCF will become a leading channel for climate finance and is working to finalize its governance and policies in 2015. The GCF includes innovative features such as a dedicated Private Sector Facility, inclusive governance, strong safeguards and accountability mechanisms, and a focus on both mitigation and adaptation. It will also work through a larger network of partners to reach more regions and communities.
