On May 21, 2021, President Joe Biden will award the Medal of Honor to retired Colonel Ralph Puckett Jr. for his gallantry during the Korean War. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea will also attend the ceremony. Puckett distinguished himself as the Commander of the 8th U.S. Army Ranger Company during an attack on Hill 205 in November 1950. He mounted a tank to obtain supporting fire, exposed himself to enemy fire, and led the Rangers in the attack. Despite being wounded, Puckett continued to direct artillery support and check the company's perimeter. When the position became untenable, he ordered the Rangers to leave him behind, but they refused and successfully retrieved him. Puckett's heroism and selflessness exemplified the highest traditions of military service. Puckett enlisted in the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps in 1943 and served in combat during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. After retiring from active duty in 1971, he worked in leadership development programs and received numerous honors. He currently resides in Columbus, Georgia, with his wife. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who demonstrate conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of their own lives.
