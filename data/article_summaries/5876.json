The White House recently hosted the White House Student Veterans and Cadets Forum, which aimed to support Historically Black College and University (HBCU) student veterans and Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) students. This event emphasized the administration's commitment to HBCUs, service members, veterans, and their families. It also recognized the 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9981 signed by President Harry Truman to integrate the Armed Forces. Biden-Harris Administration officials discussed their plans to support veterans and the military-connected community by utilizing investments in education, equity, veterans' health care, and partnerships with HBCUs.
