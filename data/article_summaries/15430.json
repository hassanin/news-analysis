President Barack Obama has sent a message to the Senate, requesting their advice and consent to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade. The Convention establishes uniform rules for the assignment of receivables in international financing transactions. It aims to facilitate cross-border receivables financing by recognizing various modern financing practices, overriding certain contractual obstacles, and providing clear conflict-of-laws rules. The United States actively participated in negotiating the Convention and believes its ratification will promote the availability of capital and credit, leading to more affordable rates and the development of international commerce. The rules outlined in the Convention align closely with existing U.S. law, particularly the Uniform Commercial Code Article 9. President Obama recommends that the Senate consider and ratify the Convention, subject to certain declarations and undertakings specified in the enclosed report.
