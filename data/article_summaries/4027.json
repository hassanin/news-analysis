The violence in Sudan is a tragic betrayal of the Sudanese people's demand for civilian government and a transition to democracy. The author calls for a ceasefire and condemns the violence that has claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians during Ramadan. The United States has been facilitating the safe departure of Americans and others, as well as conducting negotiations to de-escalate the violence. They are also providing humanitarian assistance and have issued a new Executive Order to respond to the violence with sanctions against individuals responsible for threatening peace, security, and stability, undermining Sudan's democratic transition, using violence against civilians, or committing human rights abuses. Despite enduring thirty years under an authoritarian regime, the Sudanese people remain committed to democracy and hope for a better future.
