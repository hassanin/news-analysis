President Obama and President Lee of South Korea visited the GM Assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan to tour the production of the new Chevrolet Sonic subcompact. The Sonic is the first subcompact car that GM has built in the US in nearly four decades and is currently the only subcompact car sold in the US that is built in the US. The plant in Orion, Michigan was saved from closure during GM's bankruptcy restructuring, thanks to the expertise and joint venture with GM Korea. President Obama's decision to restructure GM and Chrysler at the beginning of his administration saved over a million American jobs and revitalized the auto industry. Since the restructurings, the American auto industry has created 128,000 jobs. Congress recently passed three trade agreements that will create tens of thousands of American jobs and level the playing field for American automakers. The President worked with President Lee to improve the US-Korea Trade Agreement, providing new market access to US auto companies and eliminating barriers to the South Korean market. The agreement will also cut Korean tariffs on US autos in half immediately and eliminate them within five years. The visit to the GM plant in Michigan demonstrates how the President's decision to save the auto industry is keeping plants open and how the US-Korea economic relationship benefits American workers through investments in US manufacturing.
