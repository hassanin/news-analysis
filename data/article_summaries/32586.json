In September 2017, President Trump issued a new Executive Order imposing stronger financial sanctions on North Korea. The order targets individuals, entities, and financial institutions that engage in trade with North Korea or facilitate such trade. It gives foreign financial institutions a choice between doing business with the United States or facilitating trade with North Korea and its designated supporters.
