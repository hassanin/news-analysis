This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by Barack Obama on December 15, 2011. The memorandum discusses determinations made under Section 1106(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 regarding the Russian Federation. It states that state trading enterprises in Russia account for a significant share of exports and goods that compete with imports into Russia. These state trading enterprises are deemed to unduly burden and restrict foreign trade of the United States or its economy. 

The memorandum mentions that Russia is seeking membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and that the terms and conditions for Russia's accession include commitments to ensure that state-owned and state-controlled enterprises engage in commercial activity in a manner consistent with the WTO Agreement. This includes making purchases and sales based on commercial considerations and providing non-discriminatory terms and conditions for U.S. business firms to compete.

The obligations assumed by Russia under the WTO Agreement are stated to meet the requirements of Section 1106(b)(2)(A), and therefore, the determinations made under Section 1106(a) do not require invoking the non-application provisions of the WTO Agreement. The memorandum concludes by authorizing and directing the publication of this memorandum in the Federal Register.
