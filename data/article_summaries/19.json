The temporary order issued tonight does not stop borrowers from applying for student debt relief at studentaid.gov. The Department of Education encourages eligible borrowers to join the 22 million Americans whose information is already with the department. The order also does not prevent the department from reviewing these applications and preparing them for transmission to loan servicers. It is important to note that the order does not reverse the trial court's dismissal of the case or imply that the case has any merit. It simply prevents debt from being discharged until the court makes a decision. The department will continue to prepare for student debt relief in compliance with this order, and the administration will continue to fight against Republican officials who are suing to block relief efforts for working families.
