The Bureau of Labor Statistics has released the latest metro area unemployment rates, revealing that 79 metro areas have reached their lowest rates on record, with 41 of them reaching new record lows. These record lows span across the country, from Scranton to Spokane, from Manchester to Montgomery. White House Press Secretary Jean-Pierre commended the communities for contributing to the strength of the national economy. The Biden administration's focus on growing the economy from the middle and bottom has resulted in increased wages, consumer confidence, and a surge in Americans starting small businesses. Additionally, new factories are being built across the country, leading to the rebuilding of communities around long-term employment opportunities. President Biden's agenda has facilitated the strongest economic recovery in American history, with the addition of 13.2 million jobs and a record number of states with unemployment rates at or below 3%. Despite strong economic growth, annual inflation has decreased for twelve consecutive months. The President's Investing in America agenda has already attracted over $500 billion in new manufacturing and clean energy investments, while infrastructure projects are underway in every state. President Biden intends to continue investing in communities and serving as a president for all Americans.
