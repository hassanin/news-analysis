In a briefing, President Biden announced that the United States is close to administering 300 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 150 days. Over 182 million Americans have received at least one shot, including 90 percent of seniors and 70 percent of adults over 27. The President highlighted that COVID-19 cases and deaths have decreased by 90 percent since January, and the economy is projected to have the highest growth in four decades. However, the Delta variant is a concern, as it is responsible for half of all cases in many parts of the country and is more easily transmissible. The President urged unvaccinated individuals to get vaccinated, emphasizing the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing hospitalizations and deaths. The administration plans to focus on getting the remaining unvaccinated population vaccinated by utilizing local pharmacies, doctors' offices, mobile clinics, and special events. Additionally, COVID-19 Surge Response teams will be mobilized to assist states with low vaccination rates in responding to outbreaks. The President urged everyone to continue their efforts in defeating the pandemic and emphasized the importance of vaccination in protecting oneself and the community. In response to a question about the latest ransomware attack, the President stated that the attack appears to have caused minimal damage to U.S. businesses, and more information will be provided in the coming days.
