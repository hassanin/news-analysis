The President has made a determination regarding the supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. The Energy Information Administration's report indicates that global oil consumption has exceeded production, leading to increased demand for non-Iranian crude. However, rising production from other countries, economic developments, and smaller inventory draws suggest a looser international crude market. There is currently sufficient supply of non-Iranian oil to allow foreign countries to reduce their purchases of Iranian oil. Many purchasers of Iranian crude oil have already reduced or stopped their purchases from Iran.
