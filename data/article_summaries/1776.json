President Biden recently held a call with Northeastern Governors, FEMA Administrator Criswell, and Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall to discuss preparations for Hurricane Henri's expected landfall in Long Island or Southern New England. The participants discussed the coordination between governors, FEMA, and the National Guard in preparing for the storm's potential impacts, such as power outages, storm surge, and flooding. FEMA Administrator Criswell highlighted the resources and supplies being pre-positioned in the region, including response personnel, meals, tarps, and generators. The utility companies' preparations for power outages were also discussed, including the mobilization of additional crews and equipment. The importance of residents in the storm's path preparing for significant impacts was emphasized, along with the need to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through vaccination, mask-wearing, and social distancing if sheltering becomes necessary. The President assured the states of the full support of the Federal government in assisting with local emergency response efforts.
