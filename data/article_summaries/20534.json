The White House has issued an executive order regarding Iran, taking additional steps to address the national emergency declared in 1995. The order implements certain statutory requirements of the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 and amends previous orders related to Iran. The order authorizes the imposition of financial sanctions on foreign financial institutions that conduct significant transactions related to Iranian currency or maintain significant funds denominated in Iranian currency. It also allows for the blocking of property and interests in property of persons who have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided support to Iranian individuals or entities on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list. The order further authorizes sanctions on foreign financial institutions that facilitate significant financial transactions on behalf of designated Iranian individuals or entities, or for the sale of goods or services used in Iran's automotive sector. The order also grants the Secretary of State the authority to impose sanctions on individuals engaged in significant transactions related to the automotive sector of Iran. The order provides various actions that can be taken against sanctioned persons, including denial of visas and exclusion from the United States, denial of export licenses and procurement contracts, and restrictions on financial transactions. The Secretary of the Treasury has been delegated the authority to implement the order and take necessary actions to carry out its purposes. The order becomes effective on July 1, 2013.
