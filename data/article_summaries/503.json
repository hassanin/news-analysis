The tragic loss of life in San Antonio, Texas is being investigated as an incident caused by smugglers or human traffickers. The Department of Homeland Security is leading the investigation, and initial reports suggest that these criminals have no regard for the lives they endanger in their pursuit of profit. This event highlights the need to combat the multi-billion dollar criminal smuggling industry that preys on migrants and results in numerous innocent deaths. The United States has recently launched an anti-smuggling campaign in partnership with regional allies, resulting in over 2,400 arrests in the first three months. Exploiting vulnerable individuals for profit is shameful, and the administration is committed to stopping human smugglers and traffickers from taking advantage of those seeking to enter the United States illegally.
