In a press briefing, White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre discussed several topics, including the urgency of Congress taking action to prevent default on the national debt. She emphasized that it is Congress's constitutional duty to act and prevent a default, and that the debt ceiling has been raised three times under previous administrations, including under President Trump. Jean-Pierre also mentioned that President Biden called the four congressional leaders and invited them to the White House on May 9th to discuss the urgency of avoiding default. She stated that the President will have a separate conversation with the leaders about the budget and appropriations process. She criticized House Republicans for their proposed cuts to veterans' health benefits and clean energy tax credits, and emphasized that the President will not allow those cuts to happen. Jean-Pierre also addressed questions about the exclusion of the mayor of Prospect Park from the White House's Eid celebration, the deployment of troops to the border to support border security efforts, and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
