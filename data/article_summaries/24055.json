The article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney en route to Denver, Colorado. Carney makes a quick announcement that President Obama had a phone conversation with the Prime Minister of India to express condolences for the shooting in Wisconsin, where several victims were Indian nationals. The conversation also touched on the shared commitment to tolerance and religious freedom. Carney's colleague, Jen Psaki, then discusses the President's upcoming event in Colorado, where he will focus on women's access to affordable healthcare and the stakes of the election. Sandra Fluke will introduce the President at the event, and Elizabeth Banks has released a video on the same topic. The press then asks Carney about the Priorities USA ad and its appropriateness, to which he responds that he hasn't seen the ad but condemns the false and dishonest advertisement from the Romney campaign regarding welfare reform. Psaki adds that they have no involvement with Priorities USA and highlights the dishonesty of Romney's ad. The press also asks about polling in Colorado and the importance of shoring up the women's vote and Latino turnout. Psaki acknowledges the close race and mentions that the sampling of the poll may not reflect the final electorate. She also emphasizes the campaign's efforts to reach every voter in Colorado. The press asks about Romney's vice presidential pick, to which Carney and Psaki respond that they have no inside information but mention that they would rather have Vice President Biden campaigning for them. The press then asks about the Standard Chartered issue and the replacement for Kofi Annan, to which Carney responds that he has no updates on those topics. The press also asks about the Egyptian operation in the Sinai, to which Carney expresses regret for the loss of Egyptian life and emphasizes the need for Egypt and Israel to work together against common threats. Lastly, the press asks about the choice of locations for the President's visit to Colorado, and Psaki explains that they consult with the state to determine the most important places to reach supporters and persuade undecided voters.
