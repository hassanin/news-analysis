The White House Office of the Vice President announced an investment of nearly $8 billion in weatherization funding and energy efficiency grants as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Department of Energy will partner with state and local governments to create 87,000 jobs and save families hundreds of dollars per year on their energy bills. The funding will support weatherization of homes, including adding insulation and modernizing heating and air conditioning equipment. The Weatherization Assistance Program will allow an average investment of up to $6,500 per home for energy efficiency upgrades, and the State Energy Program funding will be available for rebates to consumers for energy saving improvements, development of renewable energy projects, and other state efforts to save families money on their energy bills. The funding will help make America more energy independent, create a cleaner economy, and create jobs for the 21st century.
