Vice President Mike Pence and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met for breakfast to reaffirm the special relationship between the United States and Israel. They discussed the shared challenges faced in the Middle East, including threats from Iran, ISIS, and other radical Islamic terrorist organizations. The leaders also talked about collaborating on issues such as cyber security, intelligence cooperation, and energy. They agreed to work together against one-sided actions against Israel at international forums and boycotts targeting Israel. Additionally, they emphasized that peace between Israel and the Palestinians can only be negotiated directly between the two parties, with the United States supporting progress towards that goal.
