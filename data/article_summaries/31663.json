White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany held a press briefing regarding the recent reports of Russian bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. McEnany criticized the New York Times for publishing classified information and emphasized that the intelligence has not been verified and there is no consensus among the intelligence community. She stated that leaking classified information undermines the country's safety and security and hinders the collection of intelligence. McEnany also addressed other topics, including the President's stance on wearing masks, the testimony of Bruce Ohr before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the actions taken by the Trump administration against Russia. She defended the President's track record of protecting American troops and criticized the politicization of intelligence by the Democratic Party. McEnany did not confirm or deny whether the President had been briefed on the intelligence regarding Russian bounties.
