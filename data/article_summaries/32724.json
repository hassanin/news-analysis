A major new survey has found that the number of adults without health insurance in the US has grown by 2 million this year, with recent coverage gains starting to erode. The survey, conducted by Gallup-Sharecare, serves as an early indicator and found that progress in reducing the number of uninsured has stalled. The losses in coverage were particularly concentrated among younger adults and those buying their own health insurance policies. This may be due to rising premiums and dwindling choices in the insurance markets created under Obama. The uninsured rate rose by 1.9 percentage points among adults aged 18-25 and 1.5 points among those aged 26-34. Young adults are considered vital for keeping health insurance premiums in check, but they may not recognize the value in having coverage if they are in good health.
