The 11th meeting of the U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security took place on October 31, 2023. The meeting was attended by key officials from both sides, including Amos Hochstein and Bj√∂rn Seibert. The discussion focused on Europe's natural gas supply diversification and the increasing liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade between the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. is now the largest supplier of LNG to Europe. The meeting also discussed AggregateEU, a gas demand aggregation and joint purchasing mechanism that has helped European companies improve their supply security and negotiate competitive prices. Additionally, the EU's efforts to reduce gas demand through energy efficiency measures, renewable energy use, and changes in industrial demand patterns were discussed. The meeting also touched upon the EU's response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine by accelerating the clean energy transition, diversifying energy supplies, and saving energy. The EU has significantly reduced its dependence on Russian fossil fuels, including phasing out coal imports and reducing oil and gas imports. The Task Force reaffirmed its commitment to advancing the energy transition to climate neutrality and enhancing energy security, as well as monitoring the energy security situation and reconvening when necessary.
