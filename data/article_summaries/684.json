President Biden has announced that the Department of Energy will release 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to lower prices for Americans and address the supply-demand mismatch caused by the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. This move is being taken in parallel with other major energy-consuming nations, including China, India, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. The release of oil from the reserve is expected to have an impact on oil prices, which have already decreased by nearly 10% in recent weeks. The President is also focused on addressing anti-competitive practices in the oil and gas sector that prevent consumers from benefiting from lower oil prices. Additionally, the Biden administration remains committed to clean energy goals, as evidenced by recent infrastructure legislation and efforts to combat climate change.
