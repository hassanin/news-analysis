Yesterday, Vice President Kamala Harris hosted a meeting at the White House with civil rights and reproductive rights leaders to discuss coalition building in order to protect reproductive health care and abortion access. The meeting focused on the intersection between the civil rights movement and reproductive rights and justice, and participants discussed the impact of the recent Supreme Court decision in Dobbs, which overturned Roe v. Wade.

During the roundtable, the attendees highlighted how vulnerable communities, such as people of color, women, and Americans with disabilities, are particularly affected by the attacks on voting rights and how Dobbs further endangers important civil rights, including contraception and marriage equality. They emphasized that the United States sets an example for democracy and freedom worldwide, and the implications of Dobbs extend beyond American women to women globally.

The participants expressed gratitude for the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to protect reproductive health and committed to continuing their collaborative work. Vice President Harris commended their leadership in defending access to reproductive health care and abortion care.

This meeting is part of the Vice President's ongoing efforts to bring together leaders from across the nation who are actively advocating for women's reproductive rights. Since May, Vice President Harris has organized over 20 gatherings to address this issue, engaging with state legislators, health care providers, constitutional law experts, faith leaders, state attorneys general, disability rights leaders, higher education leaders, and advocates.
