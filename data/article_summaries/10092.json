On March 15, 1995, President Obama declared a national emergency with respect to Iran due to their actions and policies that posed a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This led to the imposition of comprehensive sanctions through various executive orders. The national emergency declared in 1995 is still in effect and has been renewed for another year, as the actions and policies of the Iranian government continue to pose a threat. This renewal is separate from a previous emergency declaration in 1979. The notice of this renewal will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
