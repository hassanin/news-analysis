President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress requesting their consideration of Fiscal Year 2015 Budget amendments for various departments and agencies, including Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, the Interior, and State. The amendments do not affect the proposed budget totals but are necessary to reflect the policies assumed in the FY 2015 Budget. The details of the amendments can be found in the enclosure from the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
