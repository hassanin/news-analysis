President Biden has announced the nominations of eight new federal judicial nominees and his intent to nominate a ninth federal judicial nominee. These nominees are described as highly qualified, experienced, and committed to the rule of law and the Constitution. The President's choices also aim to reflect the diversity of the country, both in terms of personal and professional backgrounds. If confirmed, the slate would include the first openly LGBT judge to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, the second Latina to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, and the second AAPI woman, and first Chinese American woman, to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. These nominations bring the total number of announced federal judicial nominees by President Biden to 132. The President has a long-standing commitment to strengthening the federal bench and has been moving quickly to fill judicial vacancies. He has achieved confirmation of the most lower court judges for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration. The article also provides brief backgrounds of two nominees, Ms. Rikelman and Justice Kahn, including their educational achievements and immigration backgrounds.
