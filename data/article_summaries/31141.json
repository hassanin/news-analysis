The United States congratulates the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on its 60th anniversary. The OECD has served as an important forum for democracies around the world to promote shared prosperity through free markets, good policy, economic data, and cooperation. The organization advocates for accountability, integrity, reciprocity, transparency, and the rule of law globally. The OECD was founded in the aftermath of World War II to aid in Europe's recovery, and it played a crucial role in rebuilding the continent. Today, the challenges facing the world require international cooperation, and the OECD is well-positioned to be the most influential international organization if it remains globally focused and well-managed. The United States, as the largest contributor to the OECD, will continue to play a central role in this effort. The US reaffirms its commitment to working together with OECD member countries to address substantive issues and advance freedom and shared prosperity for future generations.
