President Biden has signed an Executive Order to establish a Presidential Emergency Board, effective July 18, 2022, in order to address an ongoing dispute between major freight rail carriers and their unions. The President aims to ensure the smooth operation of America's freight rail system, which plays a crucial role in maintaining supply chains. The Presidential Emergency Board will serve as a platform for workers and management to resolve their disagreements. Within 30 days of its establishment, the Board will investigate the dispute and deliver a report with recommendations on how to resolve it. The Executive Order also initiates a "cooling off" period to encourage the parties to work towards a negotiated settlement.
