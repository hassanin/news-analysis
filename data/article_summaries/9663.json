President Obama held a roundtable discussion at Valencia College in Orlando to discuss his plan to expand economic opportunity for women and working families. The President discussed his efforts to increase access to higher education for women and ensure that they have the necessary skills to succeed in the workforce. The event marks the beginning of a series of regional forums on women's issues that will take place across the country, leading up to the White House Summit on Working Families in June. The Administration has made investments in higher education, such as creating the American Opportunity Tax Credit and increasing the maximum Pell grant award, to support women in pursuing a college degree. The Administration is also focused on increasing opportunities for women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, as these areas offer significant economic opportunities. Efforts include increasing STEM mentorship, providing real-world job experience to high schoolers, and focusing on job-driven training. Valencia College, a community college with a large and diverse student population, was highlighted as an example of a institution that provides flexible pathways for women to broaden their skills and career options. In 2011, Valencia College won the first-ever Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence for its success in serving the needs of a diverse population.
