Press Secretary Robert Gibbs held a press gaggle at Al Faw Palace in Iraq. He mentioned that President Obama and General Odierno discussed the security situation in Iraq, noting that security incidents are at their lowest since the war began. They also talked about whether the troops have all the support they need, including mental health support. They discussed the need for continued diplomatic and political efforts, including integrating Sunnis into the security forces and addressing the balance between federal and national institutions. They also mentioned the importance of upcoming elections and the hydrocarbon law. There were updates to the schedule, but it was mentioned that President Obama may have a face-to-face meeting with Talabani somewhere in Camp Victory, rather than in the Green Zone.
