This article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney, on board Air Force One en route to Ohio. Carney discusses the Obama administration's launch of an enforcement action against China at the World Trade Organization for imposing unfair duties on over $3 billion in auto exports from the United States. He emphasizes that this action is not politically motivated and has been in development for a long time. Carney also addresses questions about the timing of the action and the President's visit to Ohio, stating that the timing was determined by the USTR and that the President's commitment to ensuring a level playing field for American companies and workers extends beyond the campaign. The article also includes a discussion about Mitt Romney's stance on the healthcare mandate and the President's view that it is a penalty, not a tax. Carney and Jen Psaki, the campaign press secretary, discuss the impact of the recovery of the auto industry on the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania and how voters make decisions based on their personal challenges and the health of the national economy.
