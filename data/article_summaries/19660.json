The White House has released a fact sheet on the U.S. Global Development Policy, signed by President Obama. The policy recognizes the importance of development to national security and calls for the elevation of development as a core pillar of American power. It outlines three pillars of the President's approach to global development: a policy focused on sustainable development outcomes, a new operational model to increase effectiveness, and a modern architecture to coordinate development efforts across government. The fact sheet also highlights three major initiatives already underway to implement the policy: Feed the Future, the Global Health Initiative, and the Global Climate Change Initiative.
