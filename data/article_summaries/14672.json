President Obama has named 100 beginning researchers as recipients of the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers. This is the highest honor bestowed by the United States government on young professionals in the early stages of their independent research careers. The recipients will receive their awards at a White House ceremony in the Fall. The awards are given to researchers whose early accomplishments show promise for strengthening America's leadership in science and technology. The winners receive up to a five-year research grant to further their study in support of critical government missions. The recipients come from various federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Veterans' Affairs, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Institutes of Health, and the National Science Foundation.
