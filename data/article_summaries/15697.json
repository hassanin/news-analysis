The White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, held a press briefing to discuss a range of topics including the President’s proposed budget, the situation in Syria, and the upcoming Super Bowl. Earnest explained that the proposed budget, which will be released on Tuesday, will reflect the President’s priorities for the country and the middle class. He also expressed disappointment that Republicans have refused to have a conversation about the budget with the President’s Budget Director. Earnest discussed the ongoing crisis in Syria, expressing concern about the humanitarian situation in Aleppo and the continued support of the Assad regime by Russia. He also mentioned the possibility of Saudi Arabia sending ground forces to fight ISIS in Syria, but stated that the details of this commitment are not yet known. Earnest acknowledged the risks associated with the Zika virus and stated that the world has learned from the slow response to the Ebola crisis, and is better prepared to respond to outbreaks. On the topic of immigration, Earnest stated that President Obama has been a leading advocate of immigration reform and stressed the importance of bringing undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. Finally, Earnest expressed support for the Carolina Panthers in the upcoming Super Bowl, but acknowledged that Peyton Manning has had a remarkable career and could perform well in the game.
