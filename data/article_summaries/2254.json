The Biden Administration is embarking on an Investing in America tour to highlight how President Biden's economic agenda is growing the economy from the middle-out and bottom-up. The tour will showcase the impact of various initiatives such as the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the American Rescue Plan. These initiatives aim to unleash a manufacturing boom, rebuild infrastructure, bring back supply chains, lower costs for families, and create jobs across the country. The tour will include visits to over 20 states, with President Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady Jill Biden, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, Cabinet members, and senior White House officials participating. Prior to the tour, a Cabinet meeting will be held to discuss the implementation of the President's agenda and how various agencies are working together to expand economic opportunity, create jobs, and lower costs for American families. The tour will cover states such as California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
