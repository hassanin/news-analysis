On Transgender Day of Visibility, the strength, joy, and courage of transgender Americans are celebrated. However, there are concerns regarding the safety and support for transgender individuals, particularly transgender kids and their families, due to the advancement of hundreds of hateful and extreme state laws by MAGA extremists. These attacks are deemed un-American and must come to an end. The discrimination, bullying, and political attacks faced by transgender youth have contributed to the national mental health crisis, with more than half of transgender youth having seriously considered suicide. To address this, the Administration is providing dedicated emergency mental health resources, including a nationwide suicide prevention and crisis hotline with counselors specifically trained to support LGBTQI+ youth. The Administration is committed to fighting against discrimination, unjust state laws, and ensuring the fundamental right and freedom for individuals to be themselves. Efforts will continue to create a world where everyone can live without fear, where communities support kids regardless of their identity, and where compassion and love surround every child. The trans community is acknowledged, and their worth, dignity, and respect are emphasized. They are seen as contributing to the strength of America, and the Administration stands in solidarity with them.
