President Obama announced new efforts to expand national service and improve pathways to employment for AmeriCorps alumni in celebration of the 20th anniversary of AmeriCorps. The new initiatives include the Employers of National Service initiative, which encourages employers to create opportunities for AmeriCorps and Peace Corps alumni, and the Stars of Service award, which recognizes young people who have demonstrated outstanding examples of volunteering and service. Additionally, there will be an expansion of partnerships between CNCS, federal agencies, and private-sector partners to increase service opportunities in AmeriCorps. These commitments build upon previous actions taken by the Administration to expand opportunities for Americans to serve and increase the impact citizens have on communities and the nation.
