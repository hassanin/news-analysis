In this letter, President Barack Obama informs the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate about the deployment of a small number of combat equipped U.S. forces to central Africa. The purpose of this deployment is to assist regional forces in removing Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), from the battlefield. The LRA has been responsible for committing atrocities in central Africa, including murder, rape, and kidnapping. Despite previous efforts, regional military efforts have been unsuccessful in removing Kony and his top commanders. The deployment of U.S. forces is seen as a significant contribution towards countering the LRA in central Africa and enhancing regional efforts. The U.S. forces will act as advisors to partner nation forces and provide information, advice, and assistance. They will only engage LRA forces if necessary for self-defense. The deployment is authorized by President Obama under his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive, and he considers it to be in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. The President appreciates the support of Congress in this action.
