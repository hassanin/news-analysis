President Obama hosted Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė, along with Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves and Latvian President Andris Bērziņš, for a meeting in the White House on August 30. The visit highlighted the strong ties between the United States and the Baltic states, particularly in the areas of defense and security cooperation. Lithuania has been a staunch supporter of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan and has committed to continuing its support for NATO's post-2014 non-combat mission. Lithuania has also made cyber security a priority and actively participates in joint military exercises with the United States. As NATO allies, the United States and Lithuania are committed to each other's security and have made valuable contributions to NATO operations. Lithuania has also been actively involved in nuclear security efforts, including the establishment of a Nuclear Security Center of Excellence in Vilnius. The State Partnership Program between Lithuania and the Pennsylvania National Guard has strengthened a wide range of Lithuanian capabilities, including crisis management and disaster response. In terms of global development, Lithuania provides bilateral assistance to Afghanistan and supports democratization efforts in various countries. Lithuania also actively participates in international forums such as the Internet Governance Forum and has hosted cultural events to strengthen ties between American and Lithuanian societies. In terms of economic cooperation, trade between the United States and Lithuania exceeded $1.9 billion in 2012, and Lithuania has expressed support for the U.S.-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) negotiations. Educational and cultural ties are also strong between the two countries, with numerous exchange programs and cultural events taking place.
