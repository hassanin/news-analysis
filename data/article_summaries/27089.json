President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the U.S. Virgin Islands due to Hurricane Maria and has ordered Federal aid to assist in the recovery efforts. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals on the island of St. Croix, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover. Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures throughout the territory. William L. Vogel has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional areas and forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance online or by calling toll-free numbers. Further information can be obtained by contacting the FEMA News Desk.
