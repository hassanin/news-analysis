The administration supports innovative strategies to combat sexual assault, such as increasing access to exams through telemedicine in rural communities and providing training for forensic professionals. The proclamation also addresses the issue of sex trafficking and the signing of the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017, which makes it easier to take legal action against individuals and websites involved in sex trafficking. The proclamation recognizes the dedication of professionals, volunteers, and concerned citizens in the fight against sexual assault and emphasizes the importance of prevention and support for survivors. It calls on Americans, law enforcement, healthcare providers, and community and faith-based organizations to work together in preventing sexual assault and supporting survivors.
