Stalking is a serious crime that affects over 7 million Americans each year, with nearly half of victims enduring unwanted contact at least once a week. Many victims are stalked by someone they know, often an intimate partner. Perpetrators have increasingly used technology, such as social media and cell phones, to stalk their victims. The Department of Justice's Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety is working to prosecute those who threaten the lives and safety of Americans. During Stalking Awareness Month, the administration is committed to raising awareness, supporting victims, and holding perpetrators accountable.
