The White House has issued a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq, which was declared by President George W. Bush in 2003, will continue for another year. The national emergency was initially declared due to the threats posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by obstacles to the reconstruction, peace, security, and development of Iraq. The notice explains that these threats are still present and therefore the national emergency must continue. The notice also states that it will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
