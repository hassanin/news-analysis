President Donald J. Trump has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 will continue beyond December 20, 2018. The national emergency was initially declared in response to the prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption originating from outside the United States. Trump believes that these issues threaten the stability of international political and economic systems, weaken democratic institutions, and pose a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. As a result, he has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
