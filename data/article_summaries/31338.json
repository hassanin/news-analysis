The Trump administration is emphasizing its commitment to improving the tax system for middle-class Americans. They claim that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has boosted the American economy by providing relief to working families through increased deductions, child tax credits, and lower tax rates. The administration argues that the new law has resulted in wage growth, consumer confidence, and low unemployment rates. They also mention the passage of Tax Reform 2.0, which aims to solidify the tax cuts and continue promoting economic prosperity. Additionally, they express their intention to implement an additional 10 percent tax cut for middle-class workers in the next Congress.
