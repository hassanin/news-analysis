The U.S. has experienced the highest economic growth among the world's leading economies since the pandemic. Over 13 million jobs have been added in just two years, surpassing the job growth of any previous four-year term. This success is attributed to Bidenomics, which focuses on building the economy from the middle class and bottom up rather than top down. Bidenomics involves three key changes: smart investments in America, educating and empowering American workers, and promoting competition to lower costs and support small businesses.
