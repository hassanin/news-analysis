President Barack Obama has proclaimed October 2016 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. The proclamation highlights the importance of equal opportunity and inclusion for individuals with disabilities in the workforce. Despite progress made since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed, there are still barriers and discrimination that individuals with disabilities face in employment. The labor force participation rate and unemployment rate for Americans with disabilities are significantly lower than those without disabilities. The Obama administration has taken steps to increase employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities, including hosting a Summit on Disability and Employment, updating Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, and signing the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The theme for this year's National Disability Employment Awareness Month is inclusion, emphasizing the importance of creating diverse and accepting workplaces. President Obama urges all Americans to embrace the talents and skills of individuals with disabilities and promote equal employment opportunities.
