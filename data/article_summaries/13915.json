Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden express their gratitude to Raj Shah, the USAID Administrator, for his leadership and dedication over the past five years. They have worked closely with him on various issues such as food security, disaster relief, Ebola response, economic development, and human rights. Dr. Jill Biden has even traveled with Raj to Zambia to promote women's empowerment. In 2011, they also visited the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya, where Raj played a crucial role in raising awareness and providing support for the relief efforts. Raj Shah has consistently sought long-term solutions and has been committed to finding new partners and implementing innovative approaches for better and more efficient outcomes. The Bidens believe that Raj Shah's impact will continue even after he leaves his position. They extend their best wishes to Raj, his wife Shivam, and their children for the upcoming year.
