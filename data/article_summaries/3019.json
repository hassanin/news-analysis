President Joseph R. Biden has proclaimed September 2022 as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. In his statement, he acknowledges the lives lost to pediatric cancer and commits to finding new therapies to treat and defeat the disease. Cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease for American children under 15, and survivors often face physical, emotional, and cognitive challenges. The Biden Administration is dedicated to ending cancer and has reignited the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, with a goal of reducing the cancer death rate by at least half over the next 25 years. The administration has also formed a Cancer Cabinet to coordinate cancer care programs and research. Additionally, they created the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) to expedite breakthroughs in disease prevention, detection, and treatment. The administration is committed to strengthening the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid to ensure access to care for children and families. They have provided health care coverage to 1 million children since President Biden took office and implemented measures to save $800 per year on health insurance premiums for 13 million Americans. The administration also aims to help families navigate the complexities of a cancer diagnosis by providing information and support through trained specialists and resources. President Biden recognizes the efforts of healthcare professionals, researchers, philanthropies, support organizations, and advocacy groups working to protect children's well-being. He honors the courage of children fighting pediatric cancers and the resilience of their families and caregivers. The proclamation calls on citizens, government agencies, businesses, nonprofits, media, and other interested groups to raise awareness and support the fight against childhood cancer.
