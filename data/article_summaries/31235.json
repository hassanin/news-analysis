The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has released its Spring Agenda, which outlines the regulatory and deregulatory actions that federal agencies plan to take in the coming year. The agenda reflects the Trump Administration's commitment to regulatory reform, with a focus on promoting economic growth and innovation. The agenda includes proposals to provide relief for small businesses, repeal outdated regulations, enable technological development, streamline licensing and permitting processes for infrastructure projects, and reduce regulatory burdens. The Administration aims to eliminate two regulatory actions for each new regulation and establish a regulatory budget that reduces costs across the government. The reforms are guided by the same standards as regulatory proposals and aim to maintain protections for health and safety. The agenda also improves transparency by providing notice of regulatory actions as they are being developed, allowing the public to comment on regulatory policy. The Administration continues to prioritize responsible and meaningful regulatory reform.
