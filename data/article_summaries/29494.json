President Trump's Trade Policy Agenda for 2019 aims to improve America's international trade situation by addressing unfair practices and protecting American industries. The report highlights the challenges faced by the US due to stolen technology, subsidies, and dumping of products by overseas competitors. The Trump administration has taken steps to counter these practices, including imposing tariffs and initiating investigations into foreign subsidies. The United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) is also expected to benefit American companies by improving copyright and patent protections, as well as encouraging auto manufacturers to shift production to the US. As a result of these efforts, the US has seen a significant increase in manufacturing jobs and overall economic growth.
