The United States strongly condemns the recent violence in South Sudan and calls for an immediate end to it. The targeting of civilians and attacks on diplomatic installations, NGOs, and humanitarian actors is unacceptable and could constitute war crimes. The US will hold those responsible accountable. The UN's efforts to protect civilians in Juba are commended, and regional leaders are being urged to help end the fighting with the support of the international community. The recent violence is causing further trauma to the South Sudanese people, who have already suffered greatly. All parties involved in the fighting must cease immediately.
