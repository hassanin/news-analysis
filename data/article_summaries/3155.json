President Biden has announced his intent to appoint three new governors to the Council of Governors: Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, Idaho Governor Brad Little, and South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. They will serve two-year terms alongside five reappointed members: Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Vermont Governor Phil Scott, Delaware Governor John Carney, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Governor Walz will continue serving as co-chair, while Governor Scott has been nominated as the second co-chair. The Council of Governors is a bipartisan group that facilitates coordination and communication between the federal government and state governments on matters of homeland security, preparedness, and response. The Council includes key federal officials such as the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security. The new appointees will replace Utah Governor Spencer Cox, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, and Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, who have completed their terms. The Council of Governors was established in 2010 and focuses on issues related to homeland security, defense, and the National Guard.
