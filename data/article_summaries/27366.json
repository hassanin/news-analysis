President Donald Trump and other United States officials recently hosted leaders from Western Hemisphere countries to discuss the need for a democratic transition in Venezuela. The leaders expressed their commitment to executing a maximum pressure policy to expedite a democratic transition and called on the international community to increase pressure on Nicolas Maduro's regime. They believe that ending Maduro's repression and economic mismanagement is crucial for safeguarding democracy in the region. The United States also urged all nations to hold the Cuban regime accountable for its role in Venezuela's decline. The US commended the Presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru for their leadership in addressing the humanitarian crisis caused by the Maduro regime. The US administration is determined to work with its partners in the Western Hemisphere until democracy and the rule of law are restored in Venezuela.
