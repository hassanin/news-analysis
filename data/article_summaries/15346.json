The article discusses the creation of the "myRA," a retirement savings account offered through employers to help Americans start saving for retirement. The myRA is targeted towards Americans who do not have access to workplace retirement savings plans. It offers principal protection, meaning the account balance will never go down in value, and contributions can be withdrawn tax-free at any time. The account is user-friendly, with low initial investments and small contributions made through payroll deductions. Savers have the option of keeping the same account when changing jobs and can roll the balance into a private-sector retirement account. The myRA will earn interest at the same rate as the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan Government Securities Investment Fund. The savings opportunity will be available to low- and middle-income households earning up to $191,000 a year. The article also mentions other proposals to help Americans save for retirement, such as establishing automatic enrollment in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) for employees without access to workplace savings plans and improving retirement tax breaks for the middle class while limiting benefits for higher-income households. The importance of securing a dignified retirement for all Americans is emphasized, as many lack access to retirement savings plans and the financial crisis has negatively impacted retirement outlooks for many families. Women, minorities, and low-income Americans are particularly at risk of an insecure retirement.
