The article discusses an executive order issued by President Joe Biden to advance equity in economic and educational opportunities for all Americans, with a specific focus on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The order recognizes the proud history and legacy of HBCUs in providing educational opportunities and pathways to success for Black students. It acknowledges the systemic barriers that HBCUs face in accessing resources and funding, and the additional challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The order establishes the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through HBCUs, which will coordinate a government-wide effort to eliminate barriers and provide support to HBCUs. It also establishes the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs, composed of HBCU presidents and leaders from various sectors, to fulfill the mission of advancing equity and opportunities for HBCUs. The order outlines specific functions and responsibilities of the Initiative and the Board, including supporting HBCU participation in federal programs, addressing disparities, promoting student success, fostering partnerships, and improving information dissemination about HBCUs. The Department of Education will provide funding and administrative support for the Initiative and the Board. The order supersedes a previous executive order on HBCUs issued in 2017.
