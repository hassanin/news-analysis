This article is a transcript of a press gaggle with Press Secretary Robert Gibbs aboard Air Force One in Copenhagen, Denmark. During the gaggle, Gibbs provides an update on the President's schedule and mentions that the President is currently meeting with General McChrystal. The meeting was arranged because McChrystal happened to be in London while the President was in Copenhagen, and they wanted to continue their conversation about Afghanistan and Pakistan. Gibbs also mentions that this is the third time the two men have spoken. When asked about McChrystal's comments in London, Gibbs says he hasn't had a chance to talk to the President about it yet. The gaggle concludes with a discussion about the President potentially speaking about the Olympic decision, watching the decision on the plane, and addressing unemployment numbers in a later statement.
