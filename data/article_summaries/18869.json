President Obama will be traveling to Michigan and Missouri in July. In Michigan, he will hold a town hall meeting in the Detroit area. In Missouri, he will throw out the first pitch at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in St. Louis. The All-Star Game is focused on community service in conjunction with the President's call to service through United We Serve. More details about both events will be released at a later date.
