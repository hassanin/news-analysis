President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed September 25 to October 1, 2023, as Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs) Week. This week celebrates the opportunities that AANAPISIs provide for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander students, particularly those from low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented backgrounds. President Biden emphasizes that diversity is a strength of the nation, and by making higher education accessible to AA and NHPI students, AANAPISIs play a crucial role in broadening opportunities and realizing the full potential of these communities. AANAPISIs enroll nearly half of all AA and NHPI undergraduates and confer a significant percentage of associate and baccalaureate degrees for these students. The President's administration is committed to supporting AANAPISIs and AA and NHPI communities, as evidenced by the $5 billion investment through the American Rescue Plan and initiatives addressing equity, justice, and opportunity. Additionally, efforts to make higher education more affordable, such as increased Pell Grants and loan forgiveness programs, are being pursued. President Biden calls on public officials, educators, and all Americans to observe this week and acknowledge the contributions of AANAPISIs and their graduates to the country.
