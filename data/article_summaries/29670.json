The Republicans and Democrats in Congress have shared their priorities for a bipartisan spending agreement. They want a two-year agreement that funds the military, protects borders, and promotes a prosperous future. It is important that funding for troops is not held hostage for immigration policy. They hope that further discussions will lead to an agreement soon.
