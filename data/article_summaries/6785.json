In his speech at a summit in Saudi Arabia, President Biden highlighted the changing dynamics in the Middle East and the need to strengthen partnerships in the region. He mentioned the efforts to undermine the rules-based order, such as China's actions in the Indo-Pacific, Russia's war against Ukraine, and Iran's destabilizing activities. Biden emphasized that for the first time since 9/11, an American President is visiting the region without American troops engaged in combat. He acknowledged the sacrifices made by American troops and expressed the determination to suppress the terrorist threat. 

Biden outlined five key principles for the United States' approach to the Middle East: supporting countries that subscribe to the rules-based international order, ensuring freedom of navigation, reducing tensions and ending conflicts, building connections between partners, and promoting human rights. He emphasized the importance of partnerships and collaboration in addressing global challenges such as food security, energy security, and the climate crisis. Biden also mentioned specific diplomatic efforts, such as the truce in Yemen and the pursuit of diplomacy to address Iran's nuclear program. He concluded by reaffirming the United States' commitment to building a positive future in the region in partnership with all countries present at the summit.
