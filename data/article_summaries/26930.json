President Donald J. Trump has fulfilled his promise to improve trade deals with South Korea. The amended trade deal, known as KORUS, includes key improvements that will protect jobs in the American auto industry and increase U.S. exports. The Trump Administration's negotiations aim to eliminate burdensome South Korean regulations that have hindered U.S. exports and ensure that trade partners follow through on implementation. Additionally, the administration has reached a separate deal with South Korea to protect American steel manufacturers and national security. The administration is also working to ensure fair treatment of American goods and prevent unfair currency practices by trading partners.
