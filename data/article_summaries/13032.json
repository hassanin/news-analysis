The Obama Administration has announced a new goal to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40-45% from 2012 levels by 2025. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, with 25 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Methane emissions accounted for nearly 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2012. The Administration plans to achieve this goal through a series of actions, including proposing and setting standards for methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from new and modified sources, developing guidelines to reduce VOC emissions in areas that do not meet the ozone health standard, enhancing leak detection and emissions reporting, updating standards to reduce venting, flaring, and leaks of natural gas from oil and gas wells on public lands, proposing natural gas pipeline safety standards, driving technology to reduce natural gas losses and improve emissions quantification, modernizing natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure, releasing a Quadrennial Energy Review focused on policy actions to modernize energy infrastructure, and collaborating with industry on voluntary efforts to reduce methane emissions. The Administration believes that achieving significant methane reductions through voluntary industry programs and state actions could reduce the need for future regulations.
