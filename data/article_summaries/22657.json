President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Washington and has ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following a severe winter storm, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred from January 14-23, 2012. The declaration makes federal funding available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Michael L. Karl has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
