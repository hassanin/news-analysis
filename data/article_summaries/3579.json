President Biden has announced additional steps to combat COVID-19, including plans for COVID-19 booster shots starting in September, new vaccination requirements for long-term care workers, and directives to ensure a safe return to in-person learning. The plan for booster shots will administer a booster eight months after an individual's second dose, beginning the week of September 20. The new regulations for long-term care workers will require nursing homes to ensure that all employees are fully vaccinated. The President has also directed the Department of Education to use all available tools to safely reopen schools and issued a memorandum to prevent interference with safety protocols. Additionally, federal reimbursement for eligible COVID-19 emergency response costs will be extended through December 31, 2021, and states will continue to be fully reimbursed for National Guard deployments supporting COVID-19 response efforts. These measures aim to stay ahead of the virus and increase vaccination rates to end the pandemic.
