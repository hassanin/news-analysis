The Middle Class Task Force held a town hall meeting in St. Cloud, Minnesota to discuss how the implementation of the Recovery Act will benefit the middle class. Vice President Biden and various secretaries, including Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan, were in attendance. The meeting focused on creating new pathways to the middle class, preserving the quality of life for middle class families, and strengthening neighborhoods. The New Flyer of America Bus Company plant in St. Cloud was chosen as the venue because it represents the success of creating jobs in America and expanding public transportation. The Middle Class Task Force released a staff report highlighting the positive impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) on middle-income families, including job creation, tax benefits, and income replacement for those affected by unemployment.
