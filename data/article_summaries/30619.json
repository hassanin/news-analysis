Vice President Mike Pence is urging Congress to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which he believes will open more markets for selling U.S. products and boost the economy. Pence visited the proving grounds of manufacturing giant Caterpillar in Arizona, where he highlighted the positive impact the USMCA could have on the manufacturing industry. He stated that the USMCA is a state-of-the-art trade deal that could serve as a template for future trade agreements. According to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA could add over $68 billion to the U.S. economy and create 176,000 American jobs, including 50,000 manufacturing jobs. Pence emphasized the importance of getting the USMCA passed, as Mexico has already ratified it and Canada is ready to do so once the U.S. does.
