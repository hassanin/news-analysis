President Obama has announced steps to reduce the dropout rate and prepare students for college and careers. The administration has committed $3.5 billion to fund changes in low-performing schools, and an additional $900 million to support School Turnaround Grants. The president emphasized the importance of investing in dropout prevention and recovery strategies and announced new efforts to invest $100 million in a College Pathways program. The goal is to promote a college readiness culture in high schools, allowing students to earn a high school diploma and college credit simultaneously. The president spoke at the America's Promise Alliance GradNation event and called for collective responsibility to end the dropout crisis.
