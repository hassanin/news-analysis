In a press conference at the White House, President Biden welcomed German Chancellor Angela Merkel and expressed condolences for the recent flooding in Germany. He praised Merkel's leadership and highlighted the strong cooperation between Germany and the United States. The two leaders discussed a wide range of issues, including the importance of democratic principles, addressing climate change, countering Russian aggression, and promoting global health security. They also discussed the situation in Haiti and Cuba, with Biden expressing concern over the deteriorating situation in both countries. On the topic of Nord Stream 2, the controversial gas pipeline between Russia and Germany, Biden said that while he had opposed it in the past, imposing sanctions now would not make sense as the project is almost complete. He emphasized the need for a level playing field in trade with China and the importance of technological leadership. Merkel also spoke about the need for cooperation with China while ensuring fair trade practices and shared values. She expressed gratitude for the United States' commitment to multilateralism and its support in areas such as climate change and vaccine distribution. The press conference concluded with discussions on the travel ban for European Union countries and the ongoing evaluation of when it can be lifted based on COVID-19 conditions.
