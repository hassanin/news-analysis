The President believes that it is important for elected leaders to work together to strengthen the economy and improve the country's fiscal situation. The bipartisan compromise on deficit reduction was a step in the right direction, but the process took too long and was divisive at times. The President has called for substantial deficit reduction through long-term entitlement changes and tax reform, as well as measures to create jobs and strengthen the recovery. The President pushed for a grand bargain that would include all of these elements and require compromise and cooperation from all sides. In the coming weeks, the President will encourage the bipartisan fiscal committee and all members of Congress to prioritize the country's recovery and long-term fiscal stability over political and ideological differences.
