President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of South Dakota and has ordered federal assistance to help with recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from September 9 to September 26, 2019. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals, counties, tribal and local governments, and certain nonprofit organizations. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing, home repairs, low-cost loans, and other programs to aid in recovery. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. James R. Stephenson has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will be available seven days a week until further notice.
