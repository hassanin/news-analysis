President Obama has directed the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish an emergency leave transfer program for federal employees affected by Hurricane Sandy. This program will allow employees to donate unused annual leave to those who need additional time off for recovery. OPM will provide guidance to agencies on how to administer the program.
