North Korea's announcement of conducting a third nuclear test is deemed a highly provocative act by the President. This action undermines regional stability, violates UN Security Council resolutions, goes against commitments made in the September 19, 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, and increases the risk of proliferation. The President asserts that North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs pose a threat to US national security and global peace. The United States remains vigilant and committed to defending its allies in the region. However, these provocations have not made North Korea more secure, but rather isolated and impoverished its people. The President calls for swift and credible action by the international community and states that the United States will continue to take necessary steps to defend itself and its allies. Close coordination with allies and partners, as well as cooperation with the Six-Party partners, UN Security Council, and other UN member states, will be pursued to address this danger.
