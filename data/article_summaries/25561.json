On November 6th, the First Lady, Melania Trump, will visit Boston, Massachusetts to highlight a treatment program for babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) as part of her Be Best initiative. She will visit Boston Medical Center to learn about their Cuddling Assists in Lowering Maternal and Infant Stress (CALM) Program, which was developed to treat babies born with NAS. In addition to CALM, Boston Medical Center has developed other programs to assist pregnant women with Substance Use Disorder (SUD) and newborn babies affected by SUD. Mrs. Trump will receive a briefing from the Boston Medical Center staff on the status of these programs and then tour the Pediatric Unit to see firsthand how these programs are implemented and meet with the successfully treated children and families.
