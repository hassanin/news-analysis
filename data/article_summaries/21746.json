The White House disagrees with the Supreme Court's decision to stay the Clean Power Plan during ongoing litigation. They believe that the plan is legally and technically sound, and provides states with the time and flexibility to develop cost-effective emission reduction plans. The White House also asserts that the Clean Power Plan will result in improved air quality, public health, clean energy investment, and job creation, while addressing the risks of climate change. They remain confident that they will ultimately succeed in the legal battle. In the meantime, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will work with states that choose to continue developing their plans, and will provide necessary tools. The Administration will also continue taking aggressive steps to reduce carbon emissions.
