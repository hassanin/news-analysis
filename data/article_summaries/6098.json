President Biden has signed a proclamation establishing the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni â€“ Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument in Arizona. This marks the fifth new national monument created by President Biden and aims to conserve nearly 1 million acres of public lands surrounding the Grand Canyon National Park. The monument will protect cultural and sacred sites that are significant to Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples in the Southwest, including the Havasupai Tribe, Hopi Tribe, and Navajo Nation, among others. The designation also supports the President's America the Beautiful Initiative, which aims to conserve and restore 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing a $44 million investment to strengthen climate resilience across America's National Parks system. This commitment reflects the Administration's dedication to protecting natural wonders, honoring culturally significant areas, and advancing climate and conservation goals.
