President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed September 2022 as National Preparedness Month in the United States. The administration is committed to preparing the nation for natural and manmade disasters, particularly extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent and severe. The most vulnerable individuals often bear the brunt of these disasters, experiencing housing insecurity and health and financial hardships. The administration's efforts include addressing the climate crisis, investing in clean energy, supporting wildfire preparedness and forest restoration, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They have also taken steps to enhance the resilience of infrastructure, such as the power grid, against future disasters. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes funding for drought, heat, and flood protection, as well as weatherization of homes. The administration is also investing in resilient supply chains and preparing for future biological threats. They are requesting funding from Congress to develop new vaccine technologies, diagnostics, therapeutics, and personal protective equipment. Preparedness requires collective effort, with FEMA playing a vital role in training and equipping emergency managers. The president encourages Americans to support first responders, download the FEMA App, turn on wireless emergency alerts, and have emergency go-bags. Resources and information on readiness can be found at Ready.gov and Listo.gov. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of preparedness and calls for enhancing resilience and readiness.
