On June 26, 2001, President Barack Obama declared a national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans due to the threat posed by extremist violence and acts obstructing the implementation of peace agreements in the region. This declaration, made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, allows the President to take measures to address this threat. The President subsequently amended the order in 2003. As the threat continues to pose a risk to national security and foreign policy, the President has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
