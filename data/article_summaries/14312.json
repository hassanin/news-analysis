The White House is transmitting a proposed Third Amendment to the Agreement for Co-operation Between the United States of America and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to Congress. This amendment extends the term of the agreement for an additional 40 years, totaling 95 years. The agreement allows for the transfer of nuclear material, equipment, and facilities for research and power production. It does not permit transfers of Restricted Data, sensitive nuclear facilities, or major critical components. If the agreement is terminated, nonproliferation conditions and controls will still apply. The President has approved the amendment and urges Congress to consider it favorably. The administration is prepared to begin consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
