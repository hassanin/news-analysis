The Obama Administration has announced a series of actions to support and advance nuclear energy as part of the United States' clean energy strategy. These actions include the establishment of the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN), which provides access to technical, regulatory, and financial support for new or advanced nuclear reactor designs. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) will work with the Department of Energy (DOE) through GAIN to navigate the regulatory process for licensing new reactor technology. The DOE is also providing funding and support for small businesses in the nuclear energy sector, as well as investing in research, development, and demonstration efforts in nuclear energy technologies. Additionally, there are efforts to address the needs of small modular reactors and to design a modernized control room for existing nuclear power plants. These actions aim to ensure that nuclear energy remains a vital component of the United States' clean energy strategy, contributing to carbon emissions reduction, economic competitiveness, and energy security.
