The United States supports the Ukrainian parliament's vote on constitutional amendments on decentralization, as it is seen as a crucial step towards reforming Ukraine's governance and empowering regional and local authorities. This vote also demonstrates Ukraine's commitment to the Minsk agreements, which require the adaptation of governance structures in certain parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. However, the United States condemns the recent clashes in Kyiv that resulted in casualties and urges all Ukrainians to avoid violence in pursuit of their political goals.
