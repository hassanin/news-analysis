The Department of Commerce has announced $146 million in awards through the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program, with an additional $1 billion in funding now available. The Biden-Harris Administration aims to bring affordable, reliable, high-speed internet to every American, including Tribal communities. The investments are already making a difference, bringing new internet service to Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian households and businesses. The Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) will announce additional awards throughout August, totaling more than $500 million. NTIA is also making an additional $1 billion in funding available to Tribal communities, bringing the total available funding to $1.98 billion. This funding will be allocated to communities in need without requiring Tribes to reapply. In addition to the funding from the NTIA, there is also funding available through the Department of Agriculture's Reconnect Program and the Department of the Treasury's Capital Projects Fund. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $2.75 billion to promote digital equity and inclusion, aiming to ensure that all people and communities can benefit from the digital economy. The Administration will work with Tribes to develop digital equity plans to help their communities adopt and use high-speed internet. The Administration will continue to invest in internet access and digital equity for Tribal communities, coordinating resources across government to meet connectivity needs. The Biden-Harris Administration has made a historic investment of $13 billion in dedicated funding for Tribes, as well as additional funding that Tribes can apply for on a competitive basis. This investment will be used for Tribal infrastructure, including transportation, roads, bridges, public transit, and clean water.
