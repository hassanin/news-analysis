Melania and Donald Trump send their best wishes to those celebrating Pioneer Day. They commemorate the arrival of Brigham Young and the first group of Latter-day Saint pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. These families fled persecution and traveled over a thousand miles from Illinois to Utah to build a new home. Over the years, around 70,000 individuals followed their lead in search of religious freedom and a better life. The nation honors the hard work and dedication of these pioneers, who transformed the desert into thriving cities and towns. Their stories serve as a reminder of the significance of religious freedom and the resilience of the American people.
