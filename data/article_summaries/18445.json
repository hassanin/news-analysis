This article is a statement by the President on the one-year anniversary of the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal. The President highlights the achievements of the deal, including the rollback of the Iranian nuclear program and the prevention of Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has verified that Iran has fulfilled its commitments under the JCPOA, with strict limitations on its nuclear program and intrusive inspections. The President also expresses concerns about Iran's threats against Israel and its support for violent proxies in Syria and Yemen. The US remains committed to opposing these actions and continues to be concerned about US citizens unjustly imprisoned in Iran. Sanctions on Iran for its human rights abuses, support for terrorist groups, and ballistic missile program will remain in place until Iran changes its behavior. The President emphasizes that the Iran deal was the result of years of work and is an agreement between major world powers, not just the US and Iran. He also states that a diplomatic resolution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is preferable to an unconstrained Iranian nuclear program or another war in the Middle East.
