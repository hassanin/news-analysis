The Obama Administration has announced new commitments and actions to reduce emissions of hydroflourocarbons (HFCs), powerful greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. The commitments made by the private sector will reduce global consumption of HFCs by the equivalent of 700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2025. The Administration is also taking executive actions to continue progress in reducing HFC emissions. HFCs are used in air conditioning and refrigeration and are up to 10,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Without action, U.S. HFC emissions are expected to nearly double by 2020 and triple by 2030. The commitments and actions announced demonstrate significant U.S. leadership in reducing HFC emissions and build on progress made earlier in the Administration. The private sector commitments span the entire HFC supply chain, from production to manufacturing to consumer use. Companies such as Coca-Cola, Carrier, DuPont, PepsiCo, and Target have committed to phasing out or reducing their use of HFCs and transitioning to climate-friendly alternatives. The Administration will continue to engage with the private sector on their progress in reducing HFC emissions. In addition to the private sector commitments, the Administration is also taking new executive actions to promote the use of safer alternatives to HFCs in the Federal Government, encourage private sector investment in low-emissions technology, and invest in new technologies to support safer alternatives to HFCs. These actions will help promote the use of safer alternatives to HFCs and encourage the development of new technologies.
