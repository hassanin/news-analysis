In August 2014, Lisa Monaco, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, released a statement regarding an attempted rescue operation of American citizens who were kidnapped by ISIL in Syria. The President authorized the operation because it was deemed that the hostages were in danger. Despite sufficient intelligence, the mission was not successful as the hostages were not present. The details of the operation cannot be revealed to protect military capabilities. The President commends the US forces and professionals involved in the mission and sends thoughts and prayers to the families of the remaining hostages. The US government will not tolerate the abduction of its citizens and will make every effort to secure their safety and hold the captors accountable.
