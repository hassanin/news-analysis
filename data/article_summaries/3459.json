The Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics, Mike Pyle, along with Finance Minister of Ukraine, Sergii Marchenko, and European Commission Director-General for Neighborhood and Enlargement Negotiations, Gert Jan Koopman, chaired the third meeting of the Steering Committee of the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine. The meeting focused on discussing progress on Ukraine's early recovery priorities, such as energy infrastructure, civilian demining, critical and social infrastructure, housing, and support to the private sector. Ukraine also provided an update on its reform agenda. Deputy National Security Advisor Pyle praised Ukraine's commitment to reform efforts, which are crucial for long-term economic sustainability and attracting financial support from the private sector. The Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) in London next month will serve as an important opportunity to demonstrate the platform's ability to provide transparency, clarity, and coordination in meeting Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction needs. The Steering Committee will hold its next meeting in June on the sidelines of the URC.
