The order emphasizes the need to increase self-sufficiency, well-being, and economic mobility.

The order outlines several principles of economic mobility that the welfare system should adhere to, including improving employment outcomes, promoting strong social networks, addressing challenges faced by vulnerable populations, balancing flexibility and accountability, reducing bureaucracy, reserving benefits for low-income individuals, reducing wasteful spending, and empowering the private sector and local communities to develop solutions to poverty.

The order also calls for a review of regulations and guidance documents related to public assistance program eligibility requirements to ensure they align with the principles outlined in the order. The Secretaries of various federal departments are tasked with submitting recommendations for regulatory and policy changes to accomplish the goals of the order.

Overall, the executive order seeks to empower individuals, streamline services, reduce dependence on welfare, and allocate resources more effectively to meet community needs. It emphasizes the importance of work requirements, accountability, and the proper use of taxpayer dollars.
