The White House has launched a public awareness campaign called "It's On Us" to prevent sexual assault on college campuses. The campaign aims to shift the way people think about sexual assault and encourage everyone to take responsibility in preventing it. It will focus on engaging college students and campus communities, particularly men, to get involved in stopping sexual assault. The campaign will work in partnership with various organizations, including the Center for American Progress, collegiate sports organizations, and private companies with connections to colleges and universities. The campaign will provide tools and resources to student-led efforts and promote bystander intervention as an effective way to prevent sexual assault. The White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault will also release best practices documents to help colleges and universities improve their response to sexual assault. The Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women will award grants to colleges for comprehensive campus sexual assault prevention and response programs. The campaign has garnered support from various partners, including media platforms, college sports organizations, celebrities, and student leaders.
