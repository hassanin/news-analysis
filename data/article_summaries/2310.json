The Biden-Harris Administration has announced that over 10 million households are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program, the largest broadband affordability program in the nation. This program, created through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, provides discounts of up to $30 per month for internet service and up to $75 per month for eligible households on Tribal lands. Additionally, eligible households can receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a computer or tablet. To be eligible for the program, household income must be at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines or a member of the household must meet certain criteria. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is partnering with outreach partners to host enrollment events and provide information on eligibility and the enrollment process. More information can be found on the FCC's website. To enroll in the program, eligible households can visit the ACPbenefit.org website or mail in an application. Spreading awareness about this program is encouraged to ensure more households can benefit from affordable broadband access.
