Officials from the White House, Treasury Department, and three states (Arizona, Michigan, and Minnesota) met with stakeholders to discuss key investments from the American Rescue Planâ€™s State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) that will provide financing to small businesses in manufacturing and critical supply chain initiatives. The Biden administration has focused on bolstering manufacturing and has created nearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs, the most of any president on record. The SSBCI is expected to catalyze up to $10 of private investment for every $1 of capital funding, resulting in billions of dollars of public and private financing for small manufacturers. Each state presented their SSBCI-funded initiatives: Michigan is expanding three lending programs to support working capital revolving lines of credit for manufacturers; Arizona has developed flexible SSBCI programs and built strong relationships with Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs); and Minnesota is developing a new loan participation program to fill the financing gap for cutting-edge equipment purchases. The SSBCI has a proven track record of supporting manufacturing, and the ARP-funded SSBCI will provide both debt and equity capital to support various needs of manufacturers. Treasury has been convening meetings for states to share best practices and collaborate on supporting small manufacturers, and a report will be released soon with program initiatives that can serve as templates for other jurisdictions.
