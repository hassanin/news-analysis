The article discusses the benefits of paid family leave and the need for mothers and fathers to have access to it. The policy outlined in the administration's budget proposal aims to encourage both parents to share parenting responsibilities and minimize hiring biases. The article emphasizes that this policy will have a particularly positive effect for women, who are more likely to leave the workforce to provide unpaid care for a child. It mentions that currently only 6% of workers in the bottom income quartile have access to paid family leave, and studies show that these individuals, especially women without a college degree, are more likely to lose or quit their jobs in the event of childbirth. The article also highlights that paid family leave has been proven to increase the likelihood of women returning to work after giving birth and reduce the need for public assistance. It states that making it easier for new parents to return to work is crucial in addressing the gender and minority pay gap. The article concludes by mentioning a recent poll that found 82% of voters believe it is important for Congress to consider a paid-leave program, and the author expresses the intention to work with lawmakers to design a policy that helps those who need it the most.
