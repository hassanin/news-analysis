The United States has expressed its support for the Guatemalan Embassy's relocation from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The US government thanks Guatemala for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and encourages other countries to do the same. President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and open an embassy there is compared to President Truman's recognition of the State of Israel 70 years ago. The US hopes that more countries will follow suit and establish their embassies in Jerusalem.
