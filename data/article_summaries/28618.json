During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not working to make a deal on COVID-19 relief for the American people. McEnany showed a video of Pelosi getting her hair done in a salon, despite salons being closed for indoor service in California at the time. McEnany accused Pelosi of wanting small businesses to stay shut down while seeking special access for herself. McEnany also mentioned that Pelosi proposed the HEROES Act, which did not include additional Paycheck Protection funding. McEnany claimed that President Trump took action to provide relief for the American people, including eviction protections, unemployment insurance, paused student loan payments, and a payroll tax cut. McEnany criticized Congress for failing to authorize funding for free school lunches, while highlighting the administration's efforts to extend a summer program to ensure children have access to free meals. She also mentioned salon owner Erica Kious, who received threats after Pelosi's comments against her salon. McEnany called on Pelosi to apologize to the American people and salon owner Kious. The briefing also included discussions on voting twice, the President's authority to withhold funding from cities, investigations into contracts awarded by Peter Navarro, herd immunity, Facebook removing posts, and an upcoming immigration order.
