The White House has announced executive actions and legislative recommendations to improve incentives for innovation in high-tech patents. The administration aims to protect innovators from frivolous litigation and ensure the highest-quality patents in the system. The legislative recommendations include requiring patentees and applicants to disclose the "Real Party-in-Interest," giving more discretion to award fees to prevailing parties in patent cases, expanding the transitional program for covered business method patents, and more. The executive actions include increasing transparency in the patent system, tightening functional claiming, empowering downstream users, expanding outreach and study, and strengthening the enforcement process of exclusion orders. The goal is to level the playing field for innovators and curb abusive litigation.
