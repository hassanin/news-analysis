The Biden family is saddened by the passing of Johnny Isakson, a former United States Representative and Senator from Georgia. Isakson was a colleague and friend to Jill Biden and Joe Biden, serving together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. They traveled together and found common ground based on mutual respect for each other and the institutions of the nation. Isakson was a proud Republican who prioritized the country over party and valued consensus over political combat. He believed that the only division was between friends and future friends. In his memory, it is important to focus on working together to provide solutions rather than just describing problems. Isakson was a patriot and a gentleman, and his loss is felt by Georgia and America. The Biden family's prayers are with Dianne and the entire Isakson family.
