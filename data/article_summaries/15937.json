In this letter, President Barack Obama expresses his support for the Secure Travel and Counterterrorism Partnership Program Act of 2011, which aims to restructure the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). He agrees that it is necessary to update the program to reflect the evolving nature of counterterrorism and security partnerships. He believes that countries that cooperate with the United States on counterterrorism initiatives and share information should have the opportunity to join the VWP.

He hopes that his visit to Poland will further strengthen the alliance between the two countries.
