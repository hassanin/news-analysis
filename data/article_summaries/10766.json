President Obama issued a statement on the 45th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, calling it one of the most historic and groundbreaking pieces of legislation in US history. He highlighted the efforts of those who fought for the act, including civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. The act guaranteed African Americans the right to vote and has been reaffirmed four times since its passage. President Obama encouraged Americans to honor the legacy of those who fought for voting rights by exercising their own right to vote and continuing the journey towards equality.
