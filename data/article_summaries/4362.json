On December 15, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared a national emergency to address the threat posed by global illicit drug trafficking. The trafficking of drugs, particularly fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, into the United States has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans annually, as well as numerous non-fatal overdoses. Drug cartels, transnational criminal organizations, and their facilitators are the primary sources of these illicit drugs, which have fueled the opioid epidemic and drug-related violence in communities. The international production, sale, and distribution of illegal drugs, including the rise of potent substances like fentanyl and the growth of online drug sales, continue to pose an extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, President Biden has decided to extend the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14059 for an additional year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
