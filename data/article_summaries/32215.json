The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has released its monthly Employment Situation Report, which shows continued job growth and a low unemployment rate in October. The report highlights the creation of over 300,000 new jobs, exceeding market expectations. Since President Trump's election in 2016, the economy has added over 6.7 million jobs. The unemployment rate slightly increased from its 50-year low of 3.5 percent in September to 3.6 percent in October. However, the unemployment rate for African Americans reached a new series low of 5.4 percent. The labor force participation rate also increased, with more prime-age adults entering the labor force. While manufacturing employment fell due to the General Motors strike, nearly 500,000 manufacturing jobs have been created since the 2016 election. The strong job market is supported by private sector surveys, which show increased employment optimism. Overall, the October employment data indicate a strong American labor market and the benefits of federal policies supporting economic growth.
