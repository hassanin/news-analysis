On April 14, 2011, the President signed into law H.R. 4, the "Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and Repayment of Exchange Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011." This law repeals the expansion in the Affordable Care Act that required businesses to report information to the IRS on payments for goods of $600 or more annually to other businesses. It also increases the amount of overpayment subject to repayment of premium assistance tax credits for health insurance coverage purchases through the Exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act.
