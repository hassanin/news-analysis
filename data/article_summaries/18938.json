The U.S.-Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) was launched by Vice President Joe Biden and the Mexican government to advance economic and commercial priorities between the two countries. The HLED will meet annually at the Cabinet level and aims to promote sustained progress in various areas of cooperation. These areas include promoting competitiveness and connectivity, fostering economic growth, productivity, entrepreneurship, and innovation, and partnering for regional and global leadership. Some initial steps towards accomplishing the goals of the HLED include continuing the work of the Mexico-U.S. Entrepreneurship and Innovation Council, collaborating on information and communications technology initiatives, and expanding the bilateral air transport relationship. The United States and Mexico also emphasize the importance of public engagement in deepening the economic relationship and plan to involve the private sector, civil society, and labor organizations in the cooperation efforts.
