The United States and France are committed to protecting the environment and are advocating for a global agreement to address plastic pollution at its source. They support launching negotiations at the upcoming UN Environment Assembly on a comprehensive plan to tackle the entire lifecycle of plastics and promote a circular economy. The agreement should include both binding and non-binding commitments, encourage countries to develop ambitious national action plans, and involve stakeholders in achieving its objectives. The United States and France are eager to collaborate with other countries to ensure a successful outcome at the UN Environment Assembly and in the development of this global agreement.
