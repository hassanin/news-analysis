Vice President Joe Biden expressed his sadness over the passing of Spurgeon M. Keeny Jr., a prominent nuclear arms control expert. Keeny held high positions in the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the White House over five administrations. He dedicated his career to stopping and reversing the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms race, and his efforts contributed to reducing the threat of nuclear conflict between Washington and Moscow. Biden offered his condolences to Keeny's family.
