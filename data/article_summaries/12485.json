President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Kansas, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred in April 2012. The funding will be available for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures in several counties. Stephen R. Thompson has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future if needed.
