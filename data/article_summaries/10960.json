President Barack Obama has sent a message to the Senate requesting their advice and consent for the ratification of the United Nations Convention on Independent Guarantees and Stand-by Letters of Credit. This Convention, signed by the United States in 1997, establishes common rules on stand-by letters of credit and other independent guarantees in international commerce. The Convention is similar to provisions in the Uniform Commercial Code Article 5, which has been enacted by all states in the US. Ratifying this Convention is expected to encourage other countries to become parties to it, promoting stability and efficiency in international commerce. The Convention has received endorsement from banking and business associations in the US. The President recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention, subject to certain understandings outlined in the enclosed report. Implementation of the Convention would require separate Federal legislation to be transmitted to Congress.
