President Obama has declared a state of emergency in South Carolina due to severe storms and flooding. This declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to save lives and protect property and public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to mobilize resources and provide equipment as needed. Emergency protective measures will be funded at 75% federal funding. W. Michael Moore has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
