In this letter, President Barack Obama expresses his support for the recommendations made by the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission. He believes that these recommendations are crucial for protecting the long-term viability of the All-Volunteer Force, improving the quality of life for service members and their families, and ensuring the fiscal sustainability of the military compensation and retirement systems. The President directs his team to consider and adopt or refine the specific proposals in as many instances as possible. He promises to report to Congress by April 30, 2015, with the initial results of this work and proposes to enact the recommended changes without delay.
