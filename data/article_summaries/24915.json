The White House has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Libya. This decision is based on the extreme measures taken by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates against the people of Libya, including the use of weapons of war and violence against unarmed civilians. There was also a risk of Libyan state assets being misappropriated if not protected. The situation in Libya has improved since the fall of Qadhafi and the establishment of a democratically elected government, but it still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The White House is working with the new Libyan government and the international community to ease sanctions and restrictions on sanctioned entities. However, the national emergency will continue to ensure the protection against threats and the abuse of assets by certain members of Qadhafi's family and former regime officials.
