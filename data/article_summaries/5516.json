In a speech at the East Room, President Biden announced a historic economic framework that he believes will create millions of jobs, stimulate economic growth, address the climate crisis, and position the United States to compete with China and other major countries. The framework is fiscally responsible, fully paid for, and will not add to the deficit, according to economists. It includes investments in infrastructure, education, childcare, and clean energy. The President emphasized the need to invest in the American people and rebuild the middle class. He also highlighted the importance of addressing climate change and improving the country's infrastructure. The framework aims to make childcare more affordable, provide high-quality preschool for every child, expand access to higher education, and extend tax credits for working families. Additionally, it includes measures to combat climate change, such as investing in clean energy and building a national network of electric vehicle charging stations. The President emphasized that the plans are fiscally responsible and will be funded by making corporations and the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes. He assured that individuals earning less than $400,000 per year will not see a tax increase. The President concluded by expressing his belief in the American people and their ability to drive the country's future success.
