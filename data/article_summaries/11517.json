President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 21-27, 2014 as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week in the United States. In his proclamation, Obama acknowledges the important legacy of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and renews the commitment to their spirit of providing equal opportunities for education. HBCUs have been instrumental in providing students with the tools to meet the challenges of a changing world and have served as hubs of economic growth and community service. The President's administration is investing in HBCUs to make college more affordable and accessible for all students. The goal is to have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week is a time to recognize the contributions of these institutions and their alumni to the country and to continue working towards making higher education accessible to every child in America.
