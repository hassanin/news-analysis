This article is a presidential memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on March 1, 2016, titled "Limiting the Use of Restrictive Housing by the Federal Government." The memorandum discusses the growing evidence that the overuse of solitary confinement and other forms of restrictive housing in U.S. correctional systems undermines public safety and goes against the values of the nation. In July 2015, the President directed the Attorney General to review the overuse of solitary confinement in American prisons. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has since studied the issue and developed strategies for reducing the use of this practice. The DOJ presented a final report with specific policy recommendations for the Federal Bureau of Prisons and other DOJ entities, as well as guiding principles for all correctional systems. The memorandum emphasizes the responsibility of the government to ensure that restrictive housing is limited and used only as a last resort. The President directs the DOJ to promptly revise its regulations and policies to implement the recommendations in the report, and other agencies are also instructed to review the report and make corresponding changes at their facilities. The memorandum states that it must be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It also clarifies that it does not create any rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities. The Attorney General is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
