The article discusses an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in 2012, establishing the President's Global Development Council. The purpose of the council is to promote development as a core pillar of American power, in line with the National Security Strategy and Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development. The council is composed of officials from various government departments, as well as individuals from outside the federal government appointed by the President. Its mission is to advise and support the President on global development issues, including innovative approaches to development, collaboration between the public and private sectors, and long-term solutions to strategic planning for development efforts. The council also aims to increase awareness and action in support of development by soliciting public input and bringing concerns and ideas to the President's attention. The council is administered by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and funding and administrative support are provided by USAID within existing appropriations. The council is set to terminate two years after the date of the order, unless renewed by the President. The order does not affect the authority of other government departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
