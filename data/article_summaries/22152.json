President Obama has issued a new Executive Order imposing sanctions on individuals who have contributed to the crisis in Burundi. The order allows for the blocking of assets and imposes visa restrictions on those who have engaged in actions that threaten peace and security, undermine democratic processes, or are responsible for human rights abuses in Burundi. The United States joins the European Union and the African Union in imposing sanctions on those undermining peace in the country. The crisis in Burundi has been caused by President Nkurunziza's pursuit of a third term in office, leading to a humanitarian, economic, and security crisis. There have been reports of targeted killings, arbitrary arrests, torture, and political repression by security forces, as well as violence and abuses by youth militia affiliated with the ruling party. The United States calls on all parties to reject violence and urges leaders to engage in dialogue to find a political solution to the crisis.
