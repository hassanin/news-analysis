President Obama has signed major disaster declarations for the states of Illinois, Oregon, and Washington. This will provide federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in areas that were struck by severe winter storms. The declarations cover specific time periods during which the states experienced significant damage. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, hazard mitigation measures, and snow removal and emergency protective measures. FEMA will coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made if requested by the states and warranted by further damage assessments.
