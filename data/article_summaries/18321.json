The White House has announced new steps to develop the tech skills of the American workforce, in order to drive innovation and economic growth. The TechHire initiative, which was launched one year ago, is being expanded to include 15 new communities, bringing the total number to over 40. These communities will work with employers to provide training programs that prepare individuals for tech jobs in a matter of months. The Department of Homeland Security has also published a final rule to expand and extend the Optional Practical Training program for STEM graduates, allowing them to stay in the US for an additional 24 months to participate in on-the-job training. Additionally, the Department of Education is launching the Career Technical Education Makeover Challenge to encourage the creation of more makerspaces in American high schools, and the 2016 National Week of Making is scheduled to take place from June 17-23. The article also provides details on the 15 new TechHire communities that have been announced, as well as information on progress in existing TechHire communities and new commitments from the private sector to support expanded access to technology training.
