This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama on June 17, 2009, addresses the issue of providing federal benefits and non-discrimination to same-sex domestic partners of federal employees. The memorandum acknowledges that many federal employees have same-sex domestic partners and highlights that leading private companies offer benefits to same-sex domestic partners that are equivalent to those provided to married individuals of the opposite sex. However, federal departments and agencies can only provide benefits to same-sex domestic partners if they have legal authorization to do so. The memorandum requests the Secretary of State and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to identify benefits that can be extended to qualified same-sex domestic partners of federal employees and to consult with the Department of Justice to ensure consistency with federal law. It also instructs other executive departments and agencies to review the benefits they provide and report their findings within 90 days. The Office of Personnel Management is directed to issue guidance on compliance with civil service laws that prohibit discrimination based on non-merit factors. The memorandum includes general provisions that clarify its implementation and states that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. Finally, it authorizes the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
