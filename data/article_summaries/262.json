Vice President Kamala Harris hosted a dinner in Los Angeles with business executives and leaders of the Call to Action for northern Central America. The dinner is part of her effort to bring together the private sector and social enterprises to invest in and support the long-term development of the region. The Vice President believes that governments cannot solve the root causes of migration from northern Central America alone, so she is focusing on involving the private sector and civil society. During the dinner, they discussed how to strengthen collaboration and reviewed progress made so far, including investments from 40 companies and organizations involved in the Call to Action.
