On December 31, 2020, the President signed several bills into law. These include the "HBCU Propelling Agency Relationships Towards a New Era of Results for Students Act," which requires Federal agencies to submit annual plans on increasing the participation of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in their programs. Another law is the "Coordinated Ocean Observations and Research Act of 2020," which reauthorizes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Integrated Ocean Observing System. It also establishes the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs. Additionally, the "Federal Advance Contracts Enhancement Act" requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency to submit a report to Congress on advance contracts established prior to disasters. Other laws cover topics such as sudden unexpected infant death, environmental sensitivity index products for the Great Lakes, protection of historic Apollo lunar landing site artifacts, transparency and accountability in veteran caregiver programs, child care staff background checks, and grants for mental health services for people with serious mental illness in correctional facilities.
