On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court made a significant ruling in the case of Brown v. Board of Education, which declared racial segregation in schools to be unconstitutional. This decision overturned the "separate but equal" doctrine established in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case, which had allowed for discriminatory practices. The Brown v. Board of Education ruling marked a turning point in the fight for civil rights and equality in America. However, it took further efforts, such as the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, to enforce the principles established by Brown. The proclamation acknowledges that while progress has been made, there is still work to be done in ensuring equal opportunities for all children. The proclamation calls upon Americans to observe the 60th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education and to continue advancing the causes of equality and opportunity for all.
