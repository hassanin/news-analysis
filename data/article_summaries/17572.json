President Barack Obama has established the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument, located in Birmingham, Alabama, to commemorate the civil rights movement in America. The monument includes the A.G. Gaston Motel, which served as the headquarters for a civil rights campaign in 1963 known as "Project C." The motel hosted leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Reverend Ralph David Abernathy, who held strategy sessions and staged marches there. The campaign brought attention to racial injustice and played a significant role in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Gaston Motel and other sites in the Birmingham Civil Rights Historic District stand as a testament to the struggle for freedom and equality. The establishment of the monument is subject to valid existing rights, and the Secretary of the Interior will manage the monument through the National Park Service. A management plan will be developed within three years to preserve and protect the historic objects and interpret the civil rights movement.
