According to an editorial in Investor's Business Daily, the proposed Tax Cut and Jobs Act in the US will cut taxes by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The editorial cites a forecast from the Heritage Foundation which predicts that the tax cuts will lead to a permanent increase in GDP of 2.6% to 2.8%. The author argues that these tax cuts will stimulate economic growth and benefit average households. The editorial also mentions that annual GDP per household could increase by $4,098 to $4,403 under the House and Senate bills respectively. The author believes that these tax cuts can help end the economic stagnation experienced in the early 21st century.
