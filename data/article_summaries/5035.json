President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed November 2023 as National Lung Cancer Awareness Month in the United States. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the country, and this proclamation aims to raise awareness about the disease and encourage prevention, detection, and treatment efforts. The president reiterates the commitment to ending cancer by investing in new and affordable ways to combat the disease. The administration has secured funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) to drive breakthroughs in cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. The government is also investing in screening and early detection services, particularly in underserved communities. Smoking cessation is highlighted as a crucial step in reducing the impact of lung cancer, and resources are available to help individuals quit smoking. The affordability of cancer treatments is addressed through measures such as capping out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare and strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The president also acknowledges the impact of cancer on veterans and firefighters and the steps taken to provide them with access to benefits and services. The proclamation emphasizes the hope that exists in the courage of those facing lung cancer, the dedication of researchers, and the compassion of healthcare workers. The call to action is for individuals, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, the media, and other interested groups to increase awareness and take steps to prevent, detect, and treat lung cancer.
