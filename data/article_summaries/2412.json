President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are prioritizing climate change as a crisis and taking action to make communities in the United States more resilient. They are particularly focused on addressing the impacts of heat advisories, wildfires, droughts, and flooding caused by extreme weather events. Vice President Harris has announced over $1 billion in funding for 53 states, territories, and Washington D.C. to improve infrastructure and increase resilience to climate change and extreme weather events. This funding is double the amount from the previous year and will more than double to $2.3 billion next year. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to strengthening the nation's resilience and addressing the climate crisis. They have launched interagency efforts to build resilience to climate impacts and have secured historic investments in clean energy, wildfire mitigation, pollution cleanup, ecosystem restoration, and resilient infrastructure. These investments will create jobs and build a clean energy economy that is resilient to climate change.
