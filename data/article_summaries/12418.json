The press briefing by Press Secretary Robert Gibbs on November 29, 2010 addressed several topics. Gibbs discussed the reaction of the President to the WikiLeaks release, stating that the President was not pleased with the information becoming public. He also mentioned that world leaders have not called the President to discuss the release. Gibbs mentioned that the administration is looking at ways to tighten up procedures for handling sensitive information and that the information was vulnerable to being stolen due to the need to share information while still protecting classified information. He also mentioned that the President would be meeting with Republicans to discuss tax cuts and the START treaty, but there were no expectations for a resolution on these issues during the meeting. Gibbs also addressed questions about the pay freeze for federal employees, the leaked cables and their impact on foreign policy, and the President's meeting with Mike Duke of Walmart. Gibbs did not provide specific details on these topics.
