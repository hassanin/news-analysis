This article discusses Executive Order 13565, which establishes the Intellectual Property Enforcement Advisory Committees. The order aims to strengthen the efforts of the Federal Government to enforce laws protecting copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other forms of intellectual property. The order establishes two committees: the Senior Intellectual Property Enforcement Advisory Committee and the Intellectual Property Enforcement Advisory Committee. The Senior Advisory Committee is chaired by the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator and includes representatives from various government departments. Its mission is to advise the Coordinator and facilitate the formation and implementation of Joint Strategic Plans. The Enforcement Advisory Committee is also chaired by the Coordinator and includes representatives from departments involved in intellectual property enforcement. Its mission is to develop Joint Strategic Plans and enhance cooperation among authorities responsible for intellectual property enforcement. The Coordinator is responsible for coordinating and supporting the work of both committees. The order does not affect the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Office of Management and Budget. It is to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The Coordinator cannot control or direct any Federal law enforcement agency in their investigative or prosecutorial authority. This order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
