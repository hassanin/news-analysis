The article is a message from former President Barack Obama to Congress, stating that he has sent a notice to the Federal Register to continue the national emergency with respect to North Korea. The national emergency was initially declared in 2008 and expanded in subsequent executive orders. The reason for continuing the national emergency is due to the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of the North Korean government that destabilize the region and pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
