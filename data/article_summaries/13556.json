President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress notifying them of his intention to enter into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement. The agreement is a free trade agreement that aims to generate export opportunities for various sectors in the United States, create jobs, and provide more choices and savings for American consumers. The TPP Agreement will also benefit other signatories by offering economic opportunity and strengthening democracy. The countries currently involved in negotiations are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The President has sent this notification at least 90 days in advance of signing the agreement, as required by the Trade Priorities Act. The Obama Administration is looking forward to working with Congress to develop legislation to approve and implement the TPP Agreement.
