The article discusses President Trump's decision to shrink national monuments, specifically focusing on the Bears Ears national monument in Utah. The author argues that while previous administrations have worked to expand the power of the Executive Branch, Trump's action seems to give power back to locals and their representatives in government. The author highlights that the designation of Bears Ears as a national monument by President Obama was met with opposition from locals and elected officials who wanted to protect culturally significant areas while allowing access and use for locals. The author suggests that Trump's decision shows a shift towards being more judicious with presidential power and benefits those who depend on public lands.
