The White House and the Department of Education have announced new efforts to improve assessments in schools. These efforts aim to eliminate unnecessary or low-quality tests that consume valuable class time and take away from the joy of learning. The Department of Education is providing nearly $8 million in grants to the Maryland State Department of Education and the Nebraska Department of Education to develop new ways to measure science achievement. Additionally, the Department of Education is releasing two final regulations under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) to give states and school districts clarity and flexibility in implementing assessments. These regulations ensure that tests are valid, reliable, and fair measures of student achievement and allow for innovative approaches to assessment. The Department of Education is also providing guidance to states and school districts on how to use federal funds to create better, fairer, and fewer tests. Profiles of districts that have taken action to improve assessments are also being released. The Institute for Education Sciences is highlighting technology-delivered assessments that have been funded through their programs.
