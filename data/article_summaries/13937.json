The President issued a statement expressing his support for the Senate's decision to repeal the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. He believes that this policy undermines national security and goes against the ideals that the military defends. The President argues that ending this policy will allow thousands of patriotic Americans, who happen to be gay, to serve openly without being forced to leave the military. He also believes that this change will only enhance the professionalism of the armed forces and strengthen their readiness. The President thanks the individuals who have worked hard to make this repeal possible and urges the Senate to send the bill to his desk so that he can sign it into law.
