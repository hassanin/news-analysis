President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring October 11, 2014, as General Pulaski Memorial Day. The proclamation pays tribute to Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski, a Polish-born leader who fought and sacrificed his life for the American Revolutionary War. Pulaski is known as the "Father of the American Cavalry" for his leadership and skill on horseback. The proclamation also recognizes the contributions of Polish-Americans to the United States and highlights the strong and close relationship between the two nations. It encourages Americans to commemorate the occasion with appropriate programs and activities honoring Pulaski and all those who defend the freedom of the nation.
