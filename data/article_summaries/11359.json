In this press gaggle, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs addresses various topics. He discusses Congressman Boehner's proposal to freeze taxes at their current level and put spending at 2008 levels, stating that the administration's position is to keep tax cuts for the middle class, while Boehner's plan is to make the tax cuts for the wealthy permanent. Gibbs also mentions that the President will talk about the fiscal implications of giving a $100,000 tax break to a millionaire. 

When asked about the possibility of compromising on the upper-income tax cuts, Gibbs states that there is no talk of moving the upper limit up from $250,000. He also addresses the BP report on the oil spill, emphasizing that the focus is on finding out what went wrong and holding those responsible accountable for the damage. 

Regarding Rahm Emanuel potentially running for mayor of Chicago, Gibbs mentions that Rahm is currently focused on his job as chief of staff and will take some time to think about his future. Gibbs also acknowledges the possibility of staff turnover after the midterm elections but states that decisions regarding that are still a couple of months away. Finally, he briefly mentions the President's infrastructure investment proposal and the importance of investing in rebuilding America.
