Yesterday, the National Climate Task Force, led by National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, held its tenth meeting to discuss ways to lower prices at the pump and achieve true energy independence. The Task Force emphasized the need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy future to address Putin's Price Hike and reduce emissions that cause climate change. They highlighted the importance of electric cars powered by clean energy, homes running on clean electricity, and a resilient and reliable grid to prevent autocrats like Putin from weaponizing fossil fuels. The Task Force also discussed advancing the President's legislative agenda, which includes tax credits to save families money, lower energy bills, boost manufacturing jobs, and promote competition. Progress on achieving the President's climate goals was also discussed, including efforts to ensure climate-smart infrastructure investments and make schools more energy efficient. The Department of the Interior's work to reclaim abandoned mines and plug orphan oil and gas wells was highlighted, as well as the Administration's commitment to environmental justice. The Task Force is chaired by the National Climate Advisor and includes Cabinet-level leaders from 21 federal agencies and senior White House officials.
