The White House has issued a notice to continue the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia. This national emergency was declared in 1995 and is being continued due to the ongoing threat that these traffickers pose to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The actions of these traffickers have resulted in extreme levels of violence, corruption, and harm both in the United States and abroad. The national emergency will continue for another year, as authorized by the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
