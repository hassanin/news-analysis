Vice President Joe Biden and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi co-chaired a meeting of the U.S.-Iraq Higher Coordinating Committee (HCC) in Washington, D.C. The two sides discussed strengthening the strategic partnership between the United States and Iraq, with a focus on energy and economic cooperation. They agreed on the need for international support to stabilize areas liberated from ISIL terrorists, including the establishment of an international stabilization fund by the Government of Iraq in partnership with the United Nations. They also discussed increasing energy exports and establishing additional export routes, as well as efforts to raise revenues, manage debt, and prioritize critical investments. Both sides expressed a commitment to facilitating bilateral trade and Iraq's entry into the World Trade Organization. This was the fifth meeting of the HCC since its establishment in 2008.
