The White House has submitted a proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of Norway Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy to Congress. The proposed agreement meets all applicable statutory requirements and aims to advance the nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United States. It allows for the transfer of unclassified information, material, equipment, and components for nuclear research and nuclear power production. The agreement also provides advance consent for Norway to retransfer irradiated nuclear material subject to the agreement to France, the United Kingdom, or other agreed-upon countries. The proposed agreement will have a term of 30 years and includes nonproliferation conditions and controls that will continue even after termination or expiration. Norway is a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has safeguards agreements in place. The President has approved the proposed agreement and urges Congress to consider it favorably. The agreement will undergo a review process with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
