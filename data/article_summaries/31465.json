The United States is reimposing nuclear-related sanctions on Iran that were previously lifted under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). These actions include sanctions on Iran's automotive sector, trade in gold and precious metals, and the Iranian rial. All remaining US nuclear-related sanctions will resume on November 5, 2018, targeting Iran's energy sector and transactions with the Central Bank of Iran. The US is committed to enforcing these sanctions and urges other nations to comply as well. The US believes that the JCPOA, which it withdrew from, failed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb and provided funds to a regime that supports terrorism. The US aims to pressure Iran through economic means and is open to a more comprehensive deal that addresses Iran's ballistic missile program and support for terrorism. The US stands with the Iranian people and hopes for a prosperous and peaceful future for them and the region.
