President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in and in relation to Burma, which was declared in Executive Order 14014 on February 10, 2021, is to continue beyond February 10, 2023. The President cites the February 1, 2021 coup in Burma, where the military overthrew the democratically elected civilian government and unjustly arrested and detained government leaders, politicians, human rights defenders, journalists, and religious leaders. This coup undermined the democratic transition and rule of law in the country and continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14014 with respect to Burma.
