The United States has expressed regret over the parliamentary elections in Cambodia on July 29, stating that they were neither free nor fair and did not represent the will of the Cambodian people. The flawed elections excluded the country's main opposition party and are seen as a significant setback to Cambodia's democratic system. The US government is disappointed with the Cambodian government's decision to disenfranchise millions of voters and restrict independent media and civil society in the lead-up to the vote. The US is considering further actions in response to the elections and recent setbacks to democracy and human rights in Cambodia. They call on the Cambodian government to promote national reconciliation by allowing independent media and civil society organizations to operate freely, releasing political prisoners, and lifting the ban on the political opposition.
