Diabetes remains a serious, chronic condition in the United States. It is the seventh leading cause of death, with over 30 million Americans currently living with diabetes and an additional 84 million at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Recent research shows an alarming increase in type 2 diabetes among youth and young adults. Diabetes can lead to various health complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, and amputation. The government is committed to supporting patients, healthcare providers, and researchers in addressing diabetes. There are now better ways to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes and treat its complications. The National Diabetes Prevention Program, established by the CDC, is now covered under Medicare and available nationwide. Medicare has also expanded its Diabetes Prevention Program to provide a lifestyle change program to at-risk beneficiaries. Ongoing research funded by the NIH is helping uncover effective methods for preventing and treating type 2 diabetes. During National Diabetes Month, it is encouraged for Americans to be proactive in their health by understanding their risk for diabetes or managing their condition with healthcare providers.
