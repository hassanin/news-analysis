Vice President Joe Biden hosted a roundtable with business leaders to discuss how the Recovery Act is creating new business opportunities and saving jobs. The event highlighted the positive impact of the Recovery Act on various sectors, including construction, energy efficiency, and housing. Business leaders shared their experiences of how the Act helped them retain employees, hire new ones, and stimulate demand for their products. The Recovery Act also provided support for small businesses through guaranteed loans and eliminated fees. The Act allocated funds for developing renewable energy sources, which led to venture capital investments in companies working on clean technology. Over 150,000 jobs have been created or saved by the Recovery Act in just over 100 days, with over $126 billion obligated to stimulative programs and projects.
