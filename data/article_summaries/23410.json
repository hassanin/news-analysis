The United States expressed deep concern over the verdicts issued by an Egyptian court against representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in a politically-motivated trial. The court's decision undermines the protection of universal human rights and raises doubts about the Egyptian government's commitment to supporting civil society. Civic groups, including international NGOs, are crucial in successful democracies as they advance freedoms, support human rights, and act as checks on the government. The US urged the Egyptian government to protect the ability of these groups to operate freely and to ensure that the civil society law being considered aligns with international standards. They also called for collaboration with international and domestic civic organizations to support Egypt's transition to democracy.
