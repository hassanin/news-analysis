President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order declaring additional steps to address the use of United States Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products by foreign malicious cyber actors. The order aims to deter foreign actors from using these products for malicious cyber activities and assist in the investigation of such activities. It provides authority to impose record-keeping obligations on foreign transactions and allows for the limitation of certain foreign actors' access to United States IaaS products. The order also encourages cooperation among United States IaaS providers and delegates the Secretary of Commerce to exempt providers or specific types of accounts from the requirements. The heads of all executive departments and agencies are directed to implement the provisions of the Executive Order.
