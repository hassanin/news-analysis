President Trump has signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, a historic legislation aimed at combating the opioid crisis. The law strengthens efforts to keep illicit drugs out of communities, monitor prescribing practices, prevent addiction, and provide treatment and recovery support for those suffering from substance use disorders. The legislation also reauthorizes the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to continue coordinating efforts across the federal government. The President and Members of Congress are commended for their bipartisan efforts to address drug use, addiction treatment, recovery support, and the flow of illicit drugs into communities. The goal is to save lives, strengthen communities, and protect the country.
