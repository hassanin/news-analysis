The Senate has confirmed three nominees to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors on a bipartisan basis. The article states that inflation has decreased by two-thirds in the past year, while the job market remains strong. The author expresses confidence that the newly appointed Dr. Jefferson, Dr. Cook, and Dr. Kugler will contribute to the continued progress in these areas. The administration aims to reduce costs for families while sustaining economic growth. The confirmation of these economists is seen as a positive step towards fulfilling the Fed's mission and serving the American people without any partisan agenda. Dr. Jefferson will become the second-ever Black Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, Dr. Cook is the first-ever Black woman to serve on the board, and Dr. Kugler will be the first-ever Hispanic American to do so.
