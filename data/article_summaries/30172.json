The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney released a statement regarding the budgetary impact analysis for the executive order titled "Establishing Enhanced Collection and Enforcement of Antidumping and Countervailing Duties and Violations of Trade and Customs Laws." The executive order directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a plan to enforce US trade laws more efficiently. According to the OMB, implementing this order would have a minimal impact on costs and revenues to the Federal Government. The benefits of the order include reducing unfair foreign competition and potentially increasing revenues. The impact on mandatory and discretionary obligations, as well as revenues, is expected to be minimal in the 5-year period starting from fiscal year 2017. The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are the agencies anticipated to be affected by this executive order.
