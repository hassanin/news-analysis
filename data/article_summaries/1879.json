The memorandum establishes the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research to address the lack of timely research and data on women's health. It emphasizes the need to accelerate research on the unique health needs of women and close the gaps in knowledge. The Initiative will be led by a Chair designated by the President and will consist of heads of various executive departments and agencies. Its mission is to advance women's health research in the United States through actions such as assessing research opportunities, setting priorities, improving coordination among agencies, developing policy recommendations, addressing health disparities, and increasing public awareness. Within 45 days, the Initiative members will provide recommendations to the President on concrete actions that agencies and offices can take to advance women's health research. The memorandum also includes general provisions and directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish it in the Federal Register.
