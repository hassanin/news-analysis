The United States and the European Commission have reached an agreement on a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. This framework aims to address the concerns raised by the Court of Justice of the European Union when it struck down the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework in 2020. The new framework will establish a legal mechanism for the transfer of EU personal data to the United States and ensure the privacy of EU personal data. The United States has committed to implementing new safeguards for signals intelligence activities and creating a mechanism for EU individuals to seek redress if they believe they are unlawfully targeted. The deal will benefit citizens on both sides of the Atlantic, providing high-standard commitments for the protection of personal data and enabling the continued flow of data that supports cross-border commerce. The agreement reflects the strong U.S.-EU relationship and shared democratic values. The new framework will underpin an inclusive and competitive digital economy and further economic cooperation. The U.S. intelligence community will implement these policies to protect citizens and allies, consistent with the framework's high-standard protections. The U.S. government and the European Commission will work together to translate this agreement into legal documents to put the framework in place.
