President Joseph R. Biden has issued an order to combat and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The order utilizes the resources of the Federal Government, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to provide COVID-19 testing sites where they are needed most. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will be responsible for establishing and operating these testing sites in coordination with state and local authorities. FEMA will fully fund the cost of these activities. The memorandum also includes general provisions to ensure compliance with applicable laws and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. The Administrator of FEMA is directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
