Second Lady Karen Pence visited Heroes to Hives, a program at Michigan State University that provides professional beekeeping training for veterans. During her visit, she learned about the program and toured the hives. Two veterans who graduated from the program shared their personal stories and the benefits they gained. Mrs. Pence also observed a hive wellness check. The program, which supports veterans through comprehensive training, a supportive community, access to scientific knowledge, and a network of veteran beekeepers, has trained and impacted the lives of 456 veterans. Mrs. Pence has been actively raising awareness about the importance of bees and pollinators through her beekeeping efforts, including installing hives at the Vice President's Residence and meeting with beekeepers and bee organization leaders.
