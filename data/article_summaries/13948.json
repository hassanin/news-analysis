This press briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney covers a range of topics including the fiscal cliff negotiations, the situation in Syria, and the Affordable Care Act. Carney emphasizes the President's position that tax cuts for the top 2 percent of earners should not be extended, and that a balanced deficit reduction plan should include both spending cuts and increased revenues from the wealthiest Americans. He also discusses the President's recognition of the Syrian Opposition Coalition and the designation of al-Nusra as a terrorist organization. Carney mentions that over 20 states have agreed to operate a health insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act, but does not go into detail about the progress or lack thereof in implementing the law.
