The article discusses the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (Agreement) and its potential impact on American jobs, the economy, and U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. The Agreement aims to level the playing field for U.S. businesses, workers, farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, investors, and service providers by providing unprecedented access to Korea's economy. It eliminates tariffs on over 95 percent of U.S. exports to Korea within the first 5 years and addresses concerns of American automakers and workers regarding the lack of a level playing field in Korea's auto market. The Agreement also ensures duty-free entry for almost two-thirds of current U.S. agricultural exports to Korea and grants American service providers greater access to Korea's services market. It includes provisions to protect and enforce intellectual property rights, reduce regulatory barriers, and promote compliance with labor and environmental laws. The increased U.S. exports expected under the Agreement are projected to support over 70,000 American jobs and enhance economic competitiveness in the region. Failure to approve the Agreement could result in further loss of market share, export-supported jobs, and economic growth opportunities for the U.S. Renewal of a strong Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is also emphasized to support Americans affected by trade. President Barack Obama urges Congress to promptly enact the legislation to seize the opportunity to support American jobs and sustain U.S. leadership in the 21st century.
