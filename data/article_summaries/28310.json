President Donald Trump has signed into law the "United States Semiquincentennial Commission Amendments Act of 2020," which amends the powers of the United States Semiquincentennial Commission. The commission is responsible for organizing and commemorating the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States in 2026. The Act specifies that the Commission will include officials who are members of the House and Senate appointed by congressional leaders, private citizens appointed by congressional leaders, and nonvoting ex officio members from the executive branch. President Trump welcomes the participation of Members of Congress and private citizens in the activities of the Commission. However, he notes that the Commission, because it includes Members of Congress and congressional appointees, may provide advice and recommendations and participate in ceremonial activities but may not participate in matters involving the execution of laws, in order to uphold the separation of powers and the Appointments and Ineligibility Clauses of the Constitution.
