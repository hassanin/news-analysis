During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki introduced Anne Neuberger, Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, who provided an update on the administration's work related to the SolarWinds cyberattack. Neuberger explained that hackers launched a broad and indiscriminate effort to compromise network management software used by both the government and the private sector. She noted that an advanced persistent threat actor, likely of Russian origin, was responsible. As of the time of the briefing, nine federal agencies and about 100 private sector companies were compromised. Neuberger emphasized that the investigation is still ongoing and that the scope and scale of the compromise are being determined. She also discussed the need to modernize federal defenses and potential response options to the perpetrators.
