The President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITF) recently held its second meeting in the Biden-Harris Administration. During the meeting, a member of the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking discussed the Council's 2022 report, which provides recommendations on how the Federal Government can enhance its policies and programs related to human trafficking. The meeting also focused on the implementation of the updated National Action Plan, which was released on December 3, 2021, and aims to strengthen the government's commitment to ending human trafficking. The PITF, a cabinet-level entity established by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, coordinates the Federal Government's anti-trafficking efforts. The National Action Plan seeks to address the disproportionate impact of human trafficking on marginalized communities and aligns with the Biden-Harris Administration's goals of equity and support for underserved populations. The plan emphasizes gender and racial equity, workers' rights, combating forced labor in supply chains, and promoting safe and humane migration. The PITF agencies focus on prevention, protection, prosecution, and partnerships to combat human trafficking. This summary provides only a brief overview of the Administration's accomplishments in 2022 and plans for 2023, with references to various documents that have guided their work, including the National Action Plan, U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking Annual Report 2022, 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, Los Angeles Declaration, Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act Strategy, List of Goods Produced by Child or Forced Labor, U.S., Japan, and EU Joint Statement, and U.S.-EU Trade and Labor Dialogue.
