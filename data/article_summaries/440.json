On July 26, 2019, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the situation in Mali. This was done through Executive Order 13882, utilizing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The national emergency was declared due to the threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by various factors in Mali. These factors include ceasefire violations, terrorist activities, drug trafficking, human rights abuses, hostage-taking, a coup d'etat, the presence of foreign mercenaries, and intensified attacks on civilians, Malian defense and security forces, and international security presences. The President has determined that the national emergency declared in 2019 must continue beyond July 26, 2023, and has therefore extended it for another year. This extension is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
