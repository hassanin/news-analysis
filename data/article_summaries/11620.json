In this statement, the President addresses the issue of equal pay in America. He highlights that women make up half of the workforce and that two-thirds of American families rely on a woman's wages as a significant portion of their income. However, women still earn only 77 cents for every dollar that men earn. This pay gap is even more significant for working women of color and affects women across all education levels. The President emphasizes that paycheck discrimination not only affects hard-working women but also hurts families and the American economy. The administration has already taken steps to address this issue, such as signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and promising to crack down on violations of equal pay laws. The President supports the Paycheck Fairness Act, which aims to ensure that men and women who do equal work receive equal pay. He urges Congress to pass this bill swiftly so that he can sign it into law.
