President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 in 2003 with respect to Zimbabwe is to continue beyond March 6, 2023. This decision is based on the fact that President Emmerson Mnangagwa has not implemented the necessary political and economic reforms to warrant the termination of targeted sanctions. The government security services in Zimbabwe have been intimidating and violently repressing citizens, including opposition members, union members, and journalists. The lack of progress in fundamental reforms poses a threat to the rule of law, democratic governance, human rights, and regional peace and security. Therefore, the national emergency and sanctions will be maintained to address this ongoing threat.
