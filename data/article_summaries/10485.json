Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first Prime Minister of a free Poland, has passed away. He was a tireless advocate for human rights and democracy, who fought against the oppression and injustice of Communism. Mazowiecki played a significant role in the Solidarity movement, which helped transform Polish society. Despite enduring prison during Poland's martial law, he became the first non-Communist Prime Minister behind the Iron Curtain in over four decades. Mazowiecki's contributions to freedom and human rights continue to inspire people today. Condolences are extended to his family and all those who are inspired by his example.
