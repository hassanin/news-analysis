The Obama Administration and Univision Network will host a Spanish-language town hall meeting on the H1N1 virus. The meeting will feature Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and other Administration officials who will respond to questions from the Latino community. The aim of the meeting is to address concerns and inform the public about the government's efforts to control the impact of the virus. The town hall meeting will be moderated by Univision Anchor Edna Schmidt and portions of it will be aired on Univision's nightly news and Sunday public affairs program. The meeting will also be open to the press and will be webcast live on the White House website.
