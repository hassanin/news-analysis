The Biden-Harris Administration will hold the first U.S.-Mexico High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) since 2016. The HLED, established in 2013, aims to promote economic development, job creation, global competitiveness, and poverty reduction. This year's dialogue will focus on four pillars: Building Back Together, promoting sustainable economic and social development in Southern Mexico and Central America, securing tools for future prosperity, and investing in people. The HLED will address various issues such as COVID-19 recovery, climate resilience, migration root causes, and security cooperation.
