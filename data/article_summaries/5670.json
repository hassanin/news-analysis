President Biden has issued an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay a minimum wage of $15 per hour to workers on federal contracts. This order aims to improve the economic security of hundreds of thousands of workers and reduce income inequality. It also promotes economy and efficiency in federal contracting by enhancing worker productivity and reducing turnover and absenteeism. Research shows that higher minimum wages increase earnings growth and benefit women and people of color, narrowing racial and gender disparities in income. The order may also have a ripple effect on competitors in the same labor markets, leading to increased wages. The U.S. Department of Labor and the Federal Acquisition and Regulatory Council will be responsible for implementing and enforcing this executive order.
