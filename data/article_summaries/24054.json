President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring September 10, 2016, as World Suicide Prevention Day. The proclamation highlights the importance of preventing suicide and the impact it has on families and communities. It acknowledges the role of mental health conditions, substance use disorders, and external factors such as harassment, bullying, and discrimination in suicide. The proclamation emphasizes the need to build safe and supportive environments, eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health issues, and provide critical help to those in crisis. The Affordable Care Act is mentioned as a significant step in expanding mental health coverage and improving access to mental health care. The proclamation also addresses the issue of suicide among veterans and service members and highlights the efforts made to improve mental health care for them. The theme of this year's World Suicide Prevention Day is "Connect. Communicate. Care.", encouraging people to reach out to those who are suffering, express when they need help, and support those around them. The proclamation calls upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, healthcare providers, and research institutions to raise awareness of mental health resources and support services in their communities and encourage those in need to seek necessary care and treatment.
