The article is a transmittal message from President Barack Obama to the Senate regarding the Protocol Amending the Convention between the United States and Spain for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income. The proposed protocol aims to bring tax treaty relations between the two countries in line with U.S. tax treaty policy. It includes provisions that exempt certain cross-border payments from source-country withholding and updates existing provisions on preventing abuse by third-country investors and exchanging information between revenue authorities. The proposed protocol also introduces binding arbitration for certain cases that cannot be resolved by the competent authorities of the United States and Spain. President Obama recommends the Senate to consider and ratify the proposed protocol.
