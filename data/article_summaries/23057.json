President Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have released the final Clean Power Plan, which sets national standards to limit carbon pollution from power plants. The plan aims to protect public health, reduce energy bills, create jobs, and bring clean power to communities across the country. It sets flexible and achievable standards to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. The plan is expected to provide significant public health benefits, create tens of thousands of jobs, drive investment in clean energy technologies, save money for families and businesses, and ensure grid reliability. It also rewards states for early investment in clean energy and prioritizes low-income communities. The Clean Power Plan continues the US's leadership on climate change and sets fair state targets based on input from stakeholders. It maintains energy efficiency as a key compliance tool, requires states to engage with vulnerable populations, and includes a proposed federal implementation plan. The plan builds on previous efforts to move towards cleaner sources of energy and reduce carbon pollution.
