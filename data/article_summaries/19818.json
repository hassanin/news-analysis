The White House has announced the successful removal and destruction of nearly 500 metric tons of chemical weapons precursors from Libya. These chemicals were remnants of the stockpile accumulated by Muammar Qaddafi's regime. The removal was carried out at the request of the Libyan Government of National Accord to fulfill their obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and to prevent the chemicals from falling into the hands of ISIL or other terrorists. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the international community responded swiftly to Libya's request for assistance. Denmark provided maritime assets for the safe removal of the chemicals, and Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Finland also provided significant support. The United States played a role in organizing and supporting this coalition, which had previously helped remove Syria's declared chemical weapons. These efforts demonstrate a commitment to rid the world of chemical weapons and prevent their use by both state and non-state actors.
