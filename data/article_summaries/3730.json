President Biden is taking further action to prevent evictions in the United States. Thanks to state eviction moratoria, about 33% of the country will be protected from evictions for the rest of the month. However, in the remaining states, action is needed. The government has allocated $46.5 billion in emergency rental assistance to help Americans facing rental debt and potential eviction due to the pandemic. While some cities and states have efficiently distributed these funds to tenants and landlords, many others have been slow to act. The Biden administration has emphasized the importance of promptly deploying these resources to meet the critical needs of Americans. The administration also expressed support for extending the eviction moratorium, especially considering the spread of the Delta variant among vulnerable populations. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not grant such an extension without new legislation. Despite this setback, President Biden has asked the CDC to explore executive action for a new 30-day eviction moratorium in counties with high COVID-19 case rates. This measure aims to encourage states and localities to expedite their emergency rental assistance programs and prevent eligible families from being evicted. The CDC is currently searching for legal authority to implement this targeted eviction moratorium. In the meantime, the administration has provided states and local governments with flexibility in distributing funds and has allowed the use of American Rescue Plan funds to help those at risk of losing their housing. President Biden remains committed to keeping people safely housed and will continue to take necessary measures to prevent evictions.
