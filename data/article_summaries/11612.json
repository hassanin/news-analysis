The Obama Administration has announced the release of open government plans by all Cabinet agencies. These plans aim to make government operations and data more transparent and provide new ways for citizens to participate in their government. Each agency has also identified a flagship initiative, such as the Department of Health and Human Services' Community Health Data Initiative, the Department of Energy's Open Energy Information Initiative, the Department of Veterans Affairs Innovation Initiative, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Homelessness Prevention Resources Initiative. The White House website tracks the progress of agencies required to meet open government milestones, and independent agencies are encouraged but not mandated to participate. In addition to the open government plans, the Administration has released new policy guidance on the use of social media, transparency in the rulemaking process, and the collection and publication of subaward data for federal grants and contracts. These efforts are part of the Administration's commitment to a more transparent, participatory, and collaborative government, which began with a presidential memorandum on the first day of President Obama's term.
