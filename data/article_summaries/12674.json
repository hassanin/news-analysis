This article discusses an executive order signed by President Obama in 2012 that aims to improve access to mental health services for veterans, service members, and military families. The order recognizes the need for increased support for the emotional and mental health needs of service members and their families, especially in light of long deployments and intense combat conditions. The order directs various government departments to expand suicide prevention strategies, increase the capacity of the Veterans Crisis Line, develop a national suicide prevention campaign, and review and realign existing mental health and substance abuse prevention programs. The order also focuses on enhancing partnerships between the Department of Veterans Affairs and community providers, expanding mental health services staffing, improving research and development efforts, and establishing a Military and Veterans Mental Health Interagency Task Force. The task force is responsible for reviewing relevant statutes, policies, and agency training and guidance to identify reforms and take actions to improve mental health and substance abuse treatment services. The order emphasizes collaboration between agencies, consultation with experts and organizations, and the development of specific goals and metrics to measure progress.
