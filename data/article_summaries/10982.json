President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the Commonwealth of Virginia in response to the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy from October 26 to November 8, 2012. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement the recovery efforts of the state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations. The funding will be available for emergency work, as well as the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Additionally, federal funding will also be provided for hazard mitigation measures throughout the entire state. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Donald L. Keldsen as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, and further designations may be made based on damage assessments.
