In this letter, President Donald Trump notifies the Congress that he has sent a notice to the Federal Register, stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566 regarding Libya will continue beyond February 25, 2020. The ongoing instability in Libya, caused by the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his associates, poses a significant threat of civil conflict. There is a risk that Libyan state assets could be misappropriated by parties seeking to undermine the United Nations peace process. The diversion of these resources could benefit ISIS and other terrorist groups, posing a risk to the national security of the United States and regional partners. The President believes that maintaining sanctions and the national emergency declaration is necessary to protect against the abuse of assets by individuals hindering Libyan national reconciliation, including Qadhafi's family and associates.
