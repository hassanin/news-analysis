President Biden has declared a major disaster for the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation due to wildfires that occurred from July 12 to August 8, 2021. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement the tribe's efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Thomas J. Dargan has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
