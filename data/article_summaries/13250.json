President Obama has announced the establishment of a special rapporteur on LGBT issues at the Organization of American States, which will be the first of its kind in the international system. This announcement was made during his trip to Brazil, where he discussed promoting respect for the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. The United States, along with 85 other countries, has reaffirmed its commitment to ending acts of violence and human rights abuses based on sexual orientation and gender identity at the United Nations Human Rights Council. President Obama is proud of the progress made in building international consensus on this issue and is dedicated to continuing efforts to advance the human rights of all people, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
