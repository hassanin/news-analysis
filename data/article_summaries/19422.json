President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Illinois due to severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between April 16 and May 5, 2013. This declaration allows federal aid to be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available to affected individuals in various counties, and assistance can include grants for temporary housing, home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. W. Michael Moore has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are still ongoing in other areas, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are completed. Residents and business owners who suffered losses in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.
