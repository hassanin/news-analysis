President Donald Trump has signed H.R. 366, the "DHS Stop Asset and Vehicle Excess Act," which assigns responsibility for determining optimal vehicle fleet size in the Department of Homeland Security to the Under Secretary for Management. The President applauds this effort to eliminate waste. However, he notes that one provision of the bill requires the Under Secretary to recommend budget rescissions to Congress if adequate steps have not been taken to achieve optimal fleet size in the previous fiscal year. The President asserts his exclusive authority, as provided by the Constitution, to recommend spending measures to Congress. The Administration is committed to working with Congress to identify and implement proposals to eliminate wasteful spending.
