President Trump signed an executive order to expand "Made in America" production, bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, and ensure access to life-saving medicines. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to use the Defense Production Act to buy essential medicines from within the US, keeping drug prices low and allowing American companies to compete fairly. The FDA and EPA will give priority to domestic manufacturers during regulatory reviews, and federal agencies will help prevent the trafficking of counterfeit medicines. President Trump has prioritized bringing blue-collar jobs back to America, and his trade accomplishments include replacing NAFTA with a stronger agreement and holding China accountable.
