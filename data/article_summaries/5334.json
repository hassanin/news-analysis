Vice President Harris launched the Root Causes Strategy to address the economic, governance, and security drivers of irregular migration from Central America. The strategy aims to foster long-term development in the region through sustained political will and cooperation. Harris has traveled to Guatemala, Mexico, and Honduras to launch initiatives that address the root causes of migration. She has also brought together private sector leaders through a Call to Action, resulting in over $1.2 billion in private sector commitments in Central America. The strategy focuses on inclusive economic growth, democratic governance, combatting corruption, women's empowerment, climate change, human rights, security, and gender-based violence. It utilizes various U.S. Government tools, including foreign assistance, development finance, public diplomacy, and economic sanctions. Additionally, Harris has engaged partners worldwide to support the work and generate new commitments. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of partnerships with the private sector and international partners. The private sector commitments aim to create new jobs and opportunities in the region. The six focus areas of the Call to Action include a reform agenda, digital and financial inclusion, food security and climate-smart agriculture, climate adaptation and clean energy, education and workforce development, and public health access. Several companies, including Microsoft, Nespresso, Mastercard, CARE International, Cargill, and PepsiCo, have made investments and commitments in the region. The strategy also highlights the Vice President's diplomatic efforts, including working with the European Union and Canada to establish United Nations Humanitarian Response Plans for Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.
