In this speech, Vice President Kamala Harris addresses the tragedy of gun violence in Monterey Park, California, and expresses condolences for the victims. She then shifts the focus to the topic of reproductive rights and the recent Supreme Court decision that limited access to abortion. Harris criticizes the Court's ruling and the impact it has had on healthcare providers and patients. She highlights specific cases where individuals were denied care or faced legal consequences due to restrictive abortion laws. Harris announces that President Biden has issued a memorandum directing the administration to identify barriers to access to prescription medication and to recommend actions to ensure safe and legal access to reproductive care. She also mentions that several states have enacted total abortion bans, leading to a loss of access to other basic healthcare services. Harris emphasizes that the right to make decisions about one's own body is fundamental and criticizes those who seek to restrict those rights. She asserts that the majority of Americans oppose these attacks on reproductive rights and calls on Congress to pass a bill that protects these rights. Harris concludes by urging Americans to join in the fight to secure reproductive rights for all.
