President Biden has declared a major disaster in North Dakota due to a severe storm, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from June 7 to June 11, 2021. Federal assistance will be provided to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The declaration makes federal funding available to governments and certain nonprofit organizations for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. It also allows for cost-sharing for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Lance Davis has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
