President Barack Obama will present the Medal of Honor to Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator Edward Byers, U.S. Navy, for his courageous actions in rescuing an American civilian held hostage in Afghanistan in 2012. Byers will be the eleventh living service member to receive the Medal of Honor for actions in Afghanistan. He was born in Toledo, Ohio in 1979 and graduated from Otesgo High School in 1997. Byers currently holds a National Paramedics License and is expected to graduate from Norwich University with a Bachelor of Science in Strategic Studies and Defense Analysis in early 2016.

Byers has received several awards and decorations, including five Bronze Star Medals, two Purple Hearts, and the Joint Service Commendation Medal with Valor device. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who demonstrate gallantry and self-sacrifice above and beyond the call of duty in actions against enemies of the United States or in military operations involving conflict with foreign forces.
