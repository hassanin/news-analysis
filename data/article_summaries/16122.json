President Obama has granted commutations to 111 individuals who were serving sentences for drug-related offenses. These individuals had been convicted for crimes such as conspiracy to distribute cocaine, possession with intent to distribute drugs, and possession of firearms in relation to drug trafficking. The commutations will result in reduced prison sentences or early release for these individuals.
