President Joseph R. Biden has proclaimed December 2023 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month in an effort to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk or drug-impaired driving. The article highlights that over 10,000 Americans die each year in preventable crashes caused by impaired driving. It emphasizes the importance of planning ahead, calling for a ride, and only driving when sober to save lives. Nearly a third of fatal car wrecks in the United States involve alcohol, and approximately 26 million people drove under the influence in 2020. The article also mentions the need for prevention through awareness campaigns and treating substance misuse. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has invested in media campaigns, but it is encouraged for individuals to spread the word and offer to be designated drivers. President Biden has requested additional funding for prevention, treatment, and recovery support services for substance misuse, as well as efforts to reduce the supply of illicit substances entering the country. The administration is also advancing technologies to prevent driving under the influence and improve road safety. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes investments in technologies that can detect and prevent impaired driving, as well as requirements for collision warnings and automatic emergency braking in new passenger cars. The Department of Transportation's National Roadway Safety Strategy aims to eliminate traffic deaths and make crashes less destructive. As the holiday season approaches, Americans are urged to make responsible decisions, arrange sober rides home, and never get behind the wheel if they have used any substance. It is also important to offer help if someone is putting themselves or others at risk. The proclamation serves as a call to action for all Americans to prevent impaired driving and save lives.
