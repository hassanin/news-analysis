President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 2010 as Older Americans Month. The theme for this year is "Age Strong, Live Long," which recognizes the efforts of people of all ages to promote the well-being, community involvement, and independence of senior citizens. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of supporting and appreciating older Americans, who have contributed significantly to the nation. The administration is committed to ensuring that older Americans can age with dignity by strengthening Medicare and Medicaid, protecting Social Security, and enacting the Affordable Care Act, which provides free preventive care, enhances care coordination, and closes the prescription drug coverage gap. The proclamation also highlights the need to prevent and eliminate elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, invest in wellness and prevention programs, and expand efforts to fight fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid. The proclamation concludes by calling upon citizens of all ages to honor older Americans with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
