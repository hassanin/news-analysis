The Biden administration is taking a whole-of-government approach to address the extreme heat impacting nearly half of the U.S. and boost climate resilience. The National Climate Task Force, led by National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, held a meeting where Cabinet members and senior officials from 17 federal agencies discussed efforts to tackle climate impacts such as heatwaves, droughts, water scarcity, and wildfires. They discussed near-term readiness plans and long-term resilience measures to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Agencies are also preparing Climate Action Plans to ensure resilient federal operations and address climate-related challenges. The Task Force, comprising government officials from 21 federal agencies, is implementing a whole-of-government approach as directed by President Biden's executive order on tackling the climate.
