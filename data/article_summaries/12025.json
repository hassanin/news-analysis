In this article, it is mentioned that President Obama received a phone call with the latest information on the response efforts to the oil spill. The Secretary of Energy, Admiral Allen, and other scientists concluded that testing the integrity of the well should proceed with modifications and safety requirements. New guidelines will be issued to BP, including additional seismic testing and monitoring, as well as control of noise and temperatures during the test. The test will take up to 48 hours and periodic evaluations will be conducted. Additional resources have been positioned to deal with the additional oil that will be released during the test. After the test, valuable data on the well's condition will be obtained, which is important for future actions to permanently seal the well. Containment efforts will resume with a new pipeline and equipment with the potential to capture up to 80,000 barrels per day.
