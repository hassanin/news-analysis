The Burmese military overthrew the democratically elected government and seized power in a coup one year ago. Since then, the regime has committed numerous brutal actions and violence against civilians, resulting in over 1,500 deaths. Thousands have been unjustly detained or subjected to sham trials, corruption is widespread, and civil conflict has escalated. The coup has caused immense suffering and undermined regional stability. The regime denies humanitarian access and attacks aid workers, despite the desperate need for life-saving aid. The international community, including ASEAN, is working together to hold those responsible accountable. They demand the release of all unjustly detained individuals, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and the restoration of democratic processes. Until then, further consequences will be imposed on the military and its supporters. The people of Burma are not forgotten, and support will continue for their struggle to bring democracy and the rule of law to their country.
