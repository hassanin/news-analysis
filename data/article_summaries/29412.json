The article discusses the issue of American exporters facing higher tariffs in more than 100 U.S. trading partner markets. This disparity in tariffs is due to the World Trade Organization's "most favored nation" rule, which prohibits discrimination among trading partners. The rule states that a WTO member state must apply the lowest tariffs it applies to any one country to every other country. However, WTO members can charge higher tariffs if they apply those nonreciprocal tariffs to all countries. The article highlights the negative impact this nonreciprocity has on American exporters, particularly in larger markets such as China, the European Union, South Korea, India, and Vietnam.
