President Obama is set to host a trilateral meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on September 22. Prior to the trilateral meeting, President Obama will have separate bilateral meetings with both leaders. These meetings are part of the ongoing efforts by President Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Special Envoy George Mitchell to lay the groundwork for the relaunch of negotiations and create a positive context for their success. The President's personal engagement in this process demonstrates his deep commitment to comprehensive peace and encouraging all sides to take responsibility for peace.
