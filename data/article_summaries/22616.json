This article is a notice from the President regarding the annual renewal of the Cuba emergency. The national emergency was declared on March 1, 1996, to address the disturbance caused by the Cuban government's destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft. The emergency was extended and expanded in 2004 to deny support to the Cuban government. The Cuban government has not shown that it will refrain from using excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft engaging in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. Unauthorized entry of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban waters is also detrimental to U.S. foreign policy. As a result, the President is continuing the national emergency and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of vessel movement. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
