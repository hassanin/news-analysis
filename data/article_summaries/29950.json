On February 25, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring the continuation of a national emergency with respect to Ukraine. This national emergency was initially declared on March 6, 2014, in response to the actions and policies of individuals that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine, threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets. Over the years, the President has issued several executive orders expanding the scope of this national emergency, addressing actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation, including its annexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine. This notice states that the national emergency and the measures adopted to address it must continue beyond March 6, 2020, in order to protect the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
