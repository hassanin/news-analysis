Tomorrow, President Obama will announce investment in sixty-six new Recovery Act broadband projects nationwide. These projects are expected to create approximately 5,000 jobs and help spur economic development in hard-hit communities. Tens of millions of Americans, businesses, healthcare facilities, and schools stand to benefit from the grants and loans totaling $795 million. These funds have been matched by over $200 million in outside investment, resulting in a total public-private investment of over $1 billion. The goal is to bring broadband service to communities with little or no access, enabling them to compete in the global marketplace. The National Economic Council predicts that the investments in broadband will create tens of thousands of jobs and expand economic development in communities that would otherwise be left behind. The grants and loans are part of a $7.2 billion investment the Recovery Act is making in expanding broadband access nationwide. Since December 2009, over $2.7 billion in Recovery Act broadband grants and loans have been awarded to more than 260 projects across the country. The awards being announced tomorrow include infrastructure awards to build and improve middle mile connections and last mile awards to connect end users to broadband infrastructure. There will also be awards to expand public computing centers in libraries, community colleges, and other public venues.
