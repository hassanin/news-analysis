This article is a presidential memorandum from September 13, 2011, regarding the continuation of the exercise of certain authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act. The memorandum states that the exercise of these authorities with respect to Cuba is scheduled to terminate on September 14, 2011, but the President determines that the continuation for one year is in the national interest of the United States. Therefore, the President authorizes the exercise of these authorities for one more year, until September 14, 2012, as implemented by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register. The memorandum is signed by President Barack Obama.
