President Donald J. Trump has announced a reform and reorganization plan to make the Federal Government more responsive and accountable to American taxpayers. He believes that the current Executive Branch is not equipped to meet the needs of the 21st century. This plan aims to eliminate wasteful spending and improve the efficiency of government activities. Trump's reform efforts build upon previous actions taken to streamline the Federal Government.
