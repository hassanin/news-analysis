This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama declaring May 11-17, 2014 as National Women's Health Week in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of expanding women's access to healthcare, fighting discrimination, and advancing the opportunity agenda. It highlights the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its provisions that prohibit insurers from charging women higher premiums based on gender, and ensure coverage for pregnancy and pre-existing conditions. The ACA also provides preventive services like contraceptive care and cancer screenings at no out-of-pocket cost. The proclamation acknowledges efforts to roll back women's rights in recent years and encourages the rejection of policies that aim to limit access to healthcare. The proclamation encourages Americans to celebrate the progress made in protecting women's health and promote awareness, prevention, and educational activities to improve women's health.
