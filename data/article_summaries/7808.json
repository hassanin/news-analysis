President Biden has directed the Department of Defense to provide technology support to Canada in order to help reduce air pollution caused by wildfires. This support will enable Canada to quickly identify and suppress new fires, preventing them from spreading and becoming uncontrollable. The initiative involves analyzing and sharing real-time data from U.S. satellites and sensors through a cooperative agreement between the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center and the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. The Biden Administration is also deploying additional personnel and equipment, including airtankers and smokejumpers, to assist with wildfire suppression efforts in Canada. The United States will continue to coordinate closely with the Canadian government in responding to the ongoing wildfires.
