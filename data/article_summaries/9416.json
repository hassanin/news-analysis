The President has made a determination regarding the supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran, as required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. The Energy Information Administration's report states that while production disruptions and concerns about Iran's nuclear activities have affected the oil market, production increases in other countries and weaker demand growth have helped alleviate the tightness in the market. There is currently enough supply of non-Iranian oil for foreign countries to significantly reduce their import of Iranian oil. Many purchasers of Iranian crude oil have already reduced their purchases or are in discussions with alternative suppliers.
