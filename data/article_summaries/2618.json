President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has declared a national emergency in response to the situation in northern Ethiopia, which poses a threat to the peace, security, and stability of Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa region. The conflict in northern Ethiopia has resulted in widespread violence, atrocities, serious human rights abuses, and obstruction of humanitarian operations. The humanitarian crisis has left millions in need of assistance and has pushed the region to the brink of famine. The United States supports international efforts to promote a negotiated ceasefire and political resolution, the withdrawal of Eritrean forces from Ethiopia, and the unity, territorial integrity, and stability of Ethiopia. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to impose sanctions on foreign individuals, entities, and military or security forces responsible for or complicit in actions or policies that threaten peace, security, or stability in Ethiopia, corruption, human rights abuses, obstruction of humanitarian assistance, violence against civilians, attacks on UN or African Union personnel, or actions that undermine democratic processes or the territorial integrity of Ethiopia. The sanctions include blocking property and interests in property, prohibiting US persons from investing in or providing financial services to sanctioned persons, and imposing restrictions on visas and entry into the United States. Transactions that evade or violate the sanctions are prohibited, and donations to sanctioned persons are prohibited. The order also provides definitions and authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to take necessary actions to implement the order.
