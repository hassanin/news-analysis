President Biden will award the Medal of Valor to fifteen public safety officers, including two who died in the line of duty, for acts of bravery in various incidents during the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 award cycles. The recipients include firefighters and police officers who showed exceptional courage to save or protect others. Some examples of their bravery include rescuing individuals from a frozen pond, engaging in a gunfight with a violent assailant, rappelling down a burning building to save a child, shielding colleagues from gunfire, plunging into a frozen lake to rescue a person, rescuing elderly residents from a burning nursing home, diving into freezing water during a blizzard to save trapped occupants, and saving swimmers from dangerous rip currents. These officers demonstrated extraordinary courage and put themselves at risk to save lives.
