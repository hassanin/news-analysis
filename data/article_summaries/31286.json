The opioid crisis in America is a major issue, with over 72,000 Americans dying from drug overdoses in 2017, mostly involving opioids. President Trump has made combating the crisis a priority, but there are signs of hope and resilience in communities affected. A clinic in Dayton, Ohio treats new mothers struggling with addiction and their babies born dependent on opioids. One young mother's story highlights the impact of treatment, as her baby would not have survived if she hadn't gone to the hospital. While the epidemic continues, there are signs of progress being made nationally.
