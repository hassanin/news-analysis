The Government of Japan has announced that it will transfer Patriot interceptor missiles to the United States to replenish U.S. inventories. This decision is seen as contributing to the security of Japan and the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region. The move ensures that U.S. forces, working closely with the Japan Self-Defense Forces, will maintain a credible deterrence and response capability. President Biden appreciates and supports Japan's leadership role and will continue to work closely with them to promote peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.
