President Donald J. Trump has signed a proclamation stating that the Republic of Chad has improved its identity-management and information sharing practices enough to meet the United States' baseline security standard. As a result, Chad nationals will once again be able to receive visas for travel to the United States. This decision is based on the Department of Homeland Security's 180-day review of entry restrictions imposed on nationals of eight countries. The review considered enhanced global security measures and whether countries have improved their identity-management and information-sharing protocols. The travel restrictions imposed by Proclamation 9645 are meant to keep the country safe and encourage countries to meet the US' baseline requirements. By lifting travel restrictions on nationals of Chad, the US is demonstrating that the criteria set forth in Proclamation 9645 can enhance the security of the country.
