The Obama administration has expressed concern over a Moscow court's decision regarding the election monitoring NGO Golos and the alleged harassment it has faced. Golos is a well-known and respected Russian independent election monitoring organization that has been operating for over a decade. The data it publishes is collected from Russian observers and citizens across the country. The administration believes that international and domestic observation is crucial for electoral transparency and that allowing observers to work without obstruction is essential. As a participating State of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Russia has agreed to the presence of foreign and domestic election observers to improve the electoral process. The United States supports Golos and other organizations working for free and fair elections in Russia and globally, with the intention of strengthening democratic institutions and processes rather than influencing elections.
