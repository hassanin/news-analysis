The Biden-Harris Administration has made significant progress in implementing the Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan. They have announced over $4 billion in funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and annual appropriations to replace lead pipes and eliminate lead exposure. Vice President Harris, along with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, are in Pittsburgh to provide an update on the Administration's commitment. They have announced $500 million for states and local governments to reduce lead exposure and create healthier homes. The awards will target disadvantaged communities in line with the President's Justice40 Initiative. The Administration is also focusing on removing lead in federally-assisted housing, schools, and child care centers, as well as closing gaps in childhood lead testing. They are developing new regulations to protect communities from lead in drinking water. The goal is to ensure that no child, family, or American is exposed to lead in their water or homes. The actions taken by the Administration are creating jobs and supporting low-income and communities of color that are disproportionately affected by lead exposure.
