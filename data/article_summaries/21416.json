President Obama will be visiting the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Friday to meet with members of the intelligence community and thank them for their work in tracking down Osama bin Laden. This visit is a presidential decision and is something that the President has been wanting to do for a while. The President believes that the situation in the Middle East and North Africa is a moment of opportunity for America, and he will be discussing this in his upcoming speech. He will also be taking this message to the G8 summit. The President urges both sides to negotiate and move forward on the peace process in the Middle East. Regarding the deficit talks, even though Senator Coburn has dropped out of the Gang of Six, the President remains optimistic that progress can still be made towards a deficit-reduction deal. The President is committed to getting our fiscal house in order and believes that it is important for both the goal itself and to continue investing in areas that will enhance growth and create well-paying jobs. There is no comment on IMF personnel, and the President will be speaking at the United States Coast Guard Academy about the unique role of the Coast Guard in protecting the United States. There is no update on Vice President Biden's talks with lawmakers, but meetings are expected to take place when both houses are back in session.
