The President has issued an Executive Order that prohibits the export of goods, technology, or services to Crimea and the import of goods, technology, or services from Crimea. It also prohibits new investments in Crimea and authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to impose sanctions on individuals and entities operating in Crimea. The order aims to clarify the stance of U.S. corporations doing business in the region and reaffirm that the United States does not accept Russia's occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea. The President calls on Russia to end its occupation and annexation of Crimea, stop supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine, and fulfill its commitments under the Minsk agreements. The Administration will continue to work with allies and partners to respond to events in Ukraine, support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and assist in its democratic development and reform efforts. Sanctions will be reviewed and adjusted in coordination with international partners to address Russia's actions.
