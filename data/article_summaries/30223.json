The Department of Commerce has filed a petition to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in response to President Trump's Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship. The petition asks the FCC to clarify that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act does not protect social media companies that alter or editorialize users' speech from civil liability. It also requests transparency requirements on their moderation practices. President Trump intends to combat what he sees as unfair and politically biased censorship of Americans online.
