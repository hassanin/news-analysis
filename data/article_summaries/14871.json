The G-20 Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies at the Toronto Summit. They reviewed the progress made in developing implementation strategies and timeframes and committed to continued and full implementation of this effort. The International Energy Agency, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and World Bank will publish a Joint Report analyzing global energy subsidies and offering recommendations for rationalization and phase out. Recent successes include India's decision to deregulate retail gasoline prices and raise prices for diesel, kerosene, and liquid petroleum gases, as well as Mexico's phased-out motor fuel subsidies and implementation of a support program for low-income households. The G-20 Leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to the implementation of the Copenhagen Accord and are working with countries around the world to cut emissions, promote clean technologies, mobilize financing, and ensure transparency in national efforts.
