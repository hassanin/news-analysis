The Supreme Court recently overturned Roe v. Wade, which eliminated a woman's Constitutional right to choose. This decision has denied fundamental rights to millions of women, disproportionately affecting women of color, low-income women, and rural women. President Biden believes that Congress needs to restore the protections of Roe as federal law to secure a woman's right to choose. In the meantime, he has committed to defending reproductive rights and protecting access to safe and legal abortion. To further these goals, President Biden will sign an Executive Order Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services. This order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take actions to safeguard access to reproductive health care services, protect patient privacy, combat digital surveillance related to reproductive health care, and promote safety and security. The order also calls for a coordinated approach from the federal government in addressing reproductive rights. The Biden-Harris Administration has already taken steps to protect access to reproductive health care and defend reproductive rights, including denouncing the Supreme Court decision and taking additional actions.
