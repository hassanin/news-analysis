President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Arizona, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that occurred between July 20 and August 7, 2010. The declaration allows for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures in Coconino County. Sandy Coachman has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
