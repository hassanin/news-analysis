In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims April 2013 as National Child Abuse Prevention Month. He highlights the importance of ensuring children know they are not alone and have support in their communities. The government has made addressing child abuse a priority and has implemented measures to prevent and address abuse. However, there is still work to be done as many children continue to experience abuse and neglect. The President calls on all Americans to observe this month by participating in programs and activities that help prevent child abuse and meet children's needs.
