In a recent Cabinet meeting, President Biden expressed relief that Congress passed a spending bill to keep the government open, avoiding a shutdown. He urged Republicans to pass a year-long budget agreement instead of waiting for the next deadline in 44 days. The President also emphasized the importance of supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression and ensuring American support is not interrupted. He highlighted the strength of the US economy and the need to act as the "indispensable nation" in the world. The meeting also addressed the topics of artificial intelligence and gun violence, with updates provided on both issues.
