The White House Office of the Vice President has issued a statement regarding the new quarterly reports posted on Recovery.gov. These reports, mandated by statute, provide detailed information about a portion of the Recovery Act activity during the fourth quarter of 2009. The reports indicate that about 600,000 workers were funded by Recovery dollars during this period. The Vice President states that these reports are a snapshot of the impact of a small portion of funds, but they are indicative that the Recovery Act is on track to create or save 3.5 million jobs by the end of 2010. The Vice President also emphasizes the unprecedented transparency effort in making this information available to the public, allowing them to see how Recovery dollars are benefiting their neighborhoods and communities.
