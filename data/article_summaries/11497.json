President Obama has declared a major disaster in North Dakota due to severe storms and flooding that occurred between May 17 and June 16, 2013. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Funding will be available for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures in various counties and tribes within the state. Gary R. Stanley has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
