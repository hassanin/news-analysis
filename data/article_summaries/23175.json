President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Minnesota and has ordered federal aid to assist in recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that occurred in September 2016. The declaration makes federal funding available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The counties of Blue Earth, Fillmore, Freeborn, Goodhue, Houston, Le Sueur, Rice, Steele, and Waseca are eligible for this assistance. David G. Samaniego has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
