Senator Tom Harkin, Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, expressed his support for President Obama's American Jobs Act. Harkin believes that the most urgent issue facing Americans is the jobs deficit, rather than the budget deficit. He commends the President's proposal for investing in jobs that sustain a strong middle class, including funding for educator jobs to prevent layoffs and renovating schools. Harkin also supports increased federal investments in infrastructure to create construction jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness. He emphasizes the need to address the unemployment rate among adults with disabilities and encourages the President to fight for the passage of the American Jobs Act. Harkin believes that breaking up the gridlock in Washington and putting America back to work is crucial for the future of the middle class and the economy.
