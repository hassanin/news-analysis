Dr. Jill Biden has arrived in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as part of her three-country visit to Africa. Her trip aims to highlight the importance of girls' education and women's participation in government, the economy, and civil society. In Kinshasa, Dr. Biden will meet with Madame Kabila to discuss the status of women, children, and vulnerable populations in the DRC. She will also meet with women entrepreneurs, including one who builds and sells robots, to showcase the US government's support for women entrepreneurs. Additionally, Dr. Biden will meet with women parliamentarians and aspiring political leaders to discuss efforts to politically empower women in the DRC. She will attend a Fourth of July reception at the Chief of Mission's Residence and then travel to Bukavu, where she will meet students enrolled in USAID-supported Accelerated Learning Programs. She will also visit Panzi Hospital to see the response services provided to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and the UNICEF Boys Reintegration Center. Dr. Biden will then return to Kinshasa for an overnight stay.
