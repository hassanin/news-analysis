In this press gaggle, Press Secretary Josh Earnest discusses President Obama's plans for the final two weeks of the election campaign, which include traveling in support of Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. Earnest also addresses the President's concerns about Donald Trump becoming president and his view that Republican majorities in Congress have obstructed progress. He also comments on the ongoing battle for Mosul in Iraq, saying it's too early to call it a failure. In response to a question about the AT&T-Time Warner deal, Earnest explains that it is a regulatory decision and the White House does not take a position on it. Earnest also dismisses a video released by Project Veritas, cautioning that their videos often distort the views of the people featured. Finally, he addresses a report that President Obama will not take any significant action on Syria before the next President takes office, saying that the President has not ruled out any options and will continue to pursue diplomatic efforts.
