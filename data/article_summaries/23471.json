President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Missouri due to flooding that occurred between June 1 and August 1, 2011. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The funding will be available to individuals in Andrew, Atchison, Buchanan, Holt, Lafayette, and Platte Counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the disaster. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Elizabeth Turner has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are ongoing in other areas, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by calling the designated phone numbers provided.
