President Barack Obama has sent a message to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13396 regarding the situation in Côte d'Ivoire is to continue beyond February 7, 2010. The situation in Côte d'Ivoire has resulted in the massacre of civilians, human rights abuses, political violence, and attacks against international peacekeeping forces. While progress has been made in implementing the Ouagadougou Political Agreement, the situation still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and related measures blocking the property of certain individuals contributing to the conflict in Côte d'Ivoire.
