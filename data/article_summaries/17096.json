President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of New York and ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in several counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help with recovery. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional counties may be designated for assistance after assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone.
