This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama to establish the Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal. The medal is awarded to members of the Armed Forces of the United States who serve or have served in Iraq, Syria, or contiguous waters or airspace on or after June 15, 2014. The executive order also states that members who qualified for the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal by serving in Iraq, Syria, or contiguous waters or airspace between June 15, 2014, and a terminal date determined by the Secretary of Defense, can remain qualified for that medal. However, they can also apply for the Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal. The order also allows for posthumous awards of the Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal and includes general provisions regarding its implementation.
