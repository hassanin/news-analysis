President Obama signed an Executive Order focused on federal leadership in environmental, energy, and economic performance. The order requires federal agencies to set sustainability goals and make improvements in their environmental, energy, and economic performance. It requires agencies to set a 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, increase energy efficiency, reduce fleet petroleum consumption, conserve water, reduce waste, support sustainable communities, and use environmentally-responsible products and technologies. The order builds on previous requirements and expands on energy reduction and environmental requirements. The projected benefits include energy savings and avoided costs from improved efficiency. The order also requires agencies to meet various energy, water, and waste reduction targets. Implementation will focus on integrating sustainability goals with agency mission and strategic planning. Examples of federal agencies promoting environmental stewardship include the Department of Veterans Affairs and the General Services Administration. Many federal agencies have received recognition for their efforts to integrate environmental considerations into their operations and management decisions.
