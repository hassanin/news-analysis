Tonight, two Americans who were wrongfully detained in Venezuela, Gustavo Cardenas and Jorge Fernandez, will be able to reunite with their families. Cardenas, who was arrested in 2017 as part of the CITGO-6, has endured five years of hardship and imprisonment. Fernandez was arrested last year on false charges. These men are fathers who have lost precious time with their children, and their families have suffered greatly during their absence. The Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, Roger Carstens, and the diplomatic team have worked tirelessly to secure their release. While celebrating the return of Cardenas and Fernandez, it is important to remember the names and stories of every American who is being unjustly held in various countries around the world. The administration will continue to fight for their freedom.
