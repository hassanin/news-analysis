President Obama spoke with Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto to discuss the influx of unaccompanied children coming from Central America to the U.S.-Mexico border. They talked about Mexico's strategy to improve controls along its border with Guatemala and Belize and how they can deepen cooperation. They also discussed the vulnerability of these children to crime and abuse and Mexico's efforts to target criminals and alert potential migrants to the dangers of the journey. President Obama reiterated that arriving migrants will not qualify for legalization under proposed immigration reform legislation or deferred action for childhood arrivals. They also discussed working with regional partners and Central American leaders to address the underlying causes of migration, including regional programs to improve public security and increase economic opportunities in Central America.
