The White House Press Secretary released a statement on the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. The statement highlights the President's commitment to fair trade agreements that allow American workers and businesses to compete globally. The legislation, which has been passed by the Senate, aims to crack down on unfair competition by trading partners and foreign companies. While there are provisions in the bill that the administration does not support, such as one related to Israeli settlement activity, it also includes measures to strengthen trade enforcement at ports and borders, improve transparency and accountability, and address unfair currency practices. The President intends to sign the bill into law in order to strengthen enforcement of trade rules and level the playing field for American workers and businesses.
