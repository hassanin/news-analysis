President Barack Obama sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives requesting Congress to consider a budget request for disaster response needs through Fiscal Year 2012. The request includes a supplemental appropriations request for Fiscal Year 2011 of $500 million and a budget amendment for Fiscal Year 2012 of $4.6 billion for the Department of Homeland Security. The total proposed funding would increase by $5.1 billion, which would be used for disaster response needs in the Disaster Relief Fund, including $1.5 billion for the Federal share of costs to respond to Hurricane Irene. The supplemental appropriations request would be designated as an emergency requirement, while the request for Fiscal Year 2012 would adjust the discretionary spending levels pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The details of the request are provided in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
