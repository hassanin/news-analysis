President Obama issued a statement expressing his support for the Small Business Jobs Bill. He stated that the bill, which was written by both Democrats and Republicans, would cut taxes and provide loans to small business owners. The President emphasized that the bill is fully paid for and would not add to the deficit. He thanked Senators Reid, Baucus, Landrieu, and the two Republican Senators who put aside partisanship to overcome a filibuster on the bill. President Obama urged all members of the Senate to support the bill's final passage as soon as possible.
