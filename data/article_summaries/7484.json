The order blocks property and interests in property of individuals and entities involved in these activities. It also suspends the entry into the United States of noncitizens who meet certain criteria. The order prohibits transactions that evade or violate the prohibitions set forth in the order and prohibits donations to blocked persons. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to take necessary actions to implement the order. The order does not affect the official business of the Federal Government or the United Nations. Recurring and final reports on the national emergency will be submitted to Congress. The order does not impair existing authorities or functions of executive departments or agencies. It is intended to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to appropriations.
