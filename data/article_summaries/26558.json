On December 1, 2018, President Donald Trump issued executive orders to mark the closure of all executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government on December 5, 2018, in honor of George Herbert Walker Bush, the forty-first President of the United States. However, heads of executive departments and agencies have the authority to keep certain offices and installations open and require certain employees to report for duty on December 5, 2018, for reasons of national security, defense, or other public need. The order also ensures that December 5, 2018, falls within the scope of certain statutes regarding the pay and leave of employees. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management is responsible for implementing this order. The order must be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, nor the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Lastly, the order does not create any right or benefit enforceable by any party against the United States or any other person.
