During a press briefing, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney announced that the 46th G7 Summit will be held at the Trump National Doral facility in Miami, Florida from June 10th to June 12th, 2020. The focus of the summit will be on global growth and challenges to the global economy, including rejuvenating incentives for growth, rolling back regulations, ending trade barriers, and reopening energy markets. Mulvaney addressed concerns about potential conflicts of interest, stating that the President will not profit from the event and that the facility was chosen based on its suitability for hosting such an event. Mulvaney also discussed the process of selecting the site, which involved visiting multiple locations and narrowing down the options. He emphasized that Doral was the best physical facility for the meeting. Mulvaney faced questions about the President's involvement in the decision, potential political motivations, and the role of Rudy Giuliani. He denied any quid pro quo related to Ukraine and maintained that the President has the right to use whoever he wants for foreign policy matters. Mulvaney also addressed concerns about the withholding of aid to Ukraine, stating that it was due to concerns about corruption and lack of support from other countries. He denied any inappropriate pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and defended the President's right to ask for cooperation in ongoing investigations. Mulvaney stated that he was not involved in pressuring Ukraine and that the President did not want to have a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He also addressed questions about the President's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, stating that he sees no issue with Giuliani's role and that it is up to the President to choose who he works with.
