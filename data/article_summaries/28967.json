The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released annual estimates of coca cultivation and cocaine production for Peru and Bolivia. The report highlights the ongoing challenge of cocaine production in the Andean region, emphasizing the threat it poses to the United States' drug addiction crisis. Peru has seen a 20% increase in potential cocaine production, reaching the highest level in 25 years, while coca cultivation has increased by 13% in 2017. The main contributing factor to this growth is increased production in the Valley of the Apur√≠mac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers (VRAEM), which poses significant security challenges for the Peruvian government. Bolivia has experienced modest decreases in coca cultivation and potential cocaine production, but still exceeds the limit set by the government for religious and cultural use by approximately 9,000 hectares. The major growing region of Yungas has consistently averaged 20,000 hectares of cultivation over the past decade. The ONDCP calls for collaborative efforts between governments to address this problem and save lives affected by drug trafficking.
