President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring October 2017 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. In the proclamation, he emphasizes that domestic violence is never acceptable and calls on all Americans to promote the safety and liberty of those subjected to violent, intimidating, or controlling behavior. He highlights the prevalence of domestic violence in the country, with nearly 1 in 4 American women aged 18 and older being victims of physical violence by an intimate partner. The proclamation recognizes the importance of addressing and stopping domestic violence and encourages individuals to be a voice for those suffering in silence. President Trump also acknowledges the efforts of advocates, victim-service providers, law enforcement officers, and others who support victims of domestic violence. He emphasizes the need to provide funding for domestic violence shelters and hotlines and to hold offenders accountable. The proclamation concludes with a call for Americans affected by domestic violence to seek help and reaffirms the commitment to creating a nation free of fear, violence, and abuse.
