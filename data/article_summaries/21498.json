The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a statement about a meeting that took place between health insurance executives and senior administration officials. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss open enrollment and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The administration is committed to working with the insurers to meet the demand for affordable health care coverage. Specifically, they are collaborating to address problems with "834" forms and direct enrollment. They have established "alpha teams" made up of insurance and CMS technology experts to fix these issues. The teams have been meeting virtually with CMS and CGI, as well as tech teams from the industry. This collaboration is part of the ongoing effort to improve performance at HealthCare.gov. The meeting included CEOs and executives from various health insurance companies.
