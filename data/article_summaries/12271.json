The Obama Administration has announced that state governments will credit the Recovery Act with creating and saving at least 250,000 education jobs across the country. A report by the Domestic Policy Council and the U.S. Department of Education shows that Recovery Act funding has enabled states to fill their education budget shortfalls, preventing layoffs and driving reform. The final individual reports on Recovery Act spending will be published on October 30th. Preliminary data also shows that federal contracts funded by the Recovery Act have created 30,000 direct jobs. The Recovery Act, signed into law in 2009, was designed to create jobs and stimulate economic growth through various means such as tax relief and funding for infrastructure projects.
