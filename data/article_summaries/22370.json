Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter expresses his support for President Obama's Middle Class Tax Cut Framework. He commends the President for prioritizing the well-being of all Americans and for not treating governance as a game. Nutter highlights the positive impact of the agreement, including the extension of tax credits for working families and incentives for businesses to create jobs. He emphasizes the importance of job creation in Philadelphia and mentions successful efforts to attract investments from major corporations. Nutter also mentions a program called Way to Work Philly, which provided employment opportunities but had its funding cut by Congressional Republicans. He emphasizes that the American people want their leaders to focus on creating jobs rather than playing political games. Nutter concludes by stating that without this deal, taxes would have increased for all Americans, including those hardest hit by the recession, and that the purpose of government is to help people, not score political points. He praises President Obama for fulfilling his role as a leader who gets things done.
