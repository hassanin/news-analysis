The White House recently convened a meeting with representatives from states, tribes, the mining industry, environmental groups, legal experts, and other stakeholders to discuss the need for reforms to the Mining Law of 1872. The law governs the extraction of minerals on federal lands and has remained largely unchanged since it was signed by Ulysses S. Grant. The current law does not require royalties to be paid for the extraction of minerals, lacks environmental provisions, and lacks a single department in charge of mining. The meeting aimed to address these issues and establish strong environmental and engagement standards for the responsible and sustainable development of domestic minerals. Participants highlighted the importance of reforming the current system and promoting a sustainable minerals economy. The Biden-Harris Administration issued principles for mining reform in February and intends to continue discussions and stakeholder engagement in the coming months.
