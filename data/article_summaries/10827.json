The United States is providing assistance to Ukraine in various forms, including financial support, law enforcement capacity building, and efforts to strengthen national unity. Vice President Joe Biden announced an additional $48 million in assistance, pending approval from Congress. This assistance is in addition to the $1 billion loan guarantee, $50 million crisis-response package, and $23 million in security assistance already provided. The $48 million assistance package aims to support economic growth, constitutional reforms, national unity, border security, anti-corruption efforts, trade diversification, and energy security. The assistance builds upon previously announced aid and is tailored to help Ukraine through the ongoing crisis. The US has also contributed funding and personnel to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to promote peace, stability, and security in Ukraine.
