A single district judge in California has reinstated a nationwide injunction to halt the implementation of rules aimed at reforming the broken asylum system. This comes after the Ninth Circuit had previously struck down the same injunction. The Attorney General has expressed concerns about the threat such injunctions pose to the Constitutional order. The ruling is seen as beneficial to human smugglers and traffickers, and it undermines the rule of law. The Supreme Court has been asked to set aside the district court's injunction, and the request is still pending.
