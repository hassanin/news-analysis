The White House has announced the opening of two new national centers to improve the administration of the US export control system. The Export Enforcement Coordination Center (E2C2) will enhance information sharing and coordination between law enforcement and intelligence officials regarding possible violations of export control laws. The Information Triage Unit (ITU) will assemble and disseminate relevant information to make informed decisions on proposed exports requiring a US government license. These centers aim to streamline and improve the export control system, protect national security, and strengthen the US defense industrial base.
