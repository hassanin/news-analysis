The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its final monthly Employment Situation Report of 2018, revealing that the U.S. economy added 312,000 jobs in December. This exceeded market expectations and was higher than the average monthly job additions in the previous two years. Overall, the U.S. economy created 2.6 million new jobs in 2018. Industries such as education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and manufacturing saw significant job gains. Manufacturing, in particular, has seen a resurgence since President Trump's election, adding an average of 20,000 new jobs per month. Wages also increased, with nominal average hourly earnings rising by 3.2 percent over the year. The unemployment rate increased slightly to 3.9 percent in December, but this was due to more workers entering the labor force. The labor force participation rate also rose. Unemployment rates for demographic groups such as Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, and individuals with less education reached record lows throughout the year. The strong labor market and consistent job growth in 2018 are attributed to the effectiveness of the administration's economic policies.
