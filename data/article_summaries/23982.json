This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama in 2009, emphasizes the importance of tribal consultation in the United States. It recognizes the unique legal and political relationship between the United States and Indian tribal governments and highlights the need for regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of federal policies that affect tribal communities. The memorandum directs each agency head to submit a detailed plan of actions they will take to implement Executive Order 13175, which promotes tribal consultation. It also requires agencies to provide progress reports on their implementation efforts. The memorandum further mandates the review of agency plans and progress reports by the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Within one year, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget is to submit a report on the implementation of Executive Order 13175 across the executive branch, including any recommendations for improvement. It clarifies the definitions of "Indian tribe," "tribal officials," and "policies that have tribal implications." The memorandum concludes by stating that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities, and that agencies must carry out its provisions within the limits of the law and their authorities.
