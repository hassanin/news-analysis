The Corporation for National Community Service (CNCS), along with The Rockefeller Foundation and Cities of Service, has announced the selection of ten Resilience AmeriCorps cities as part of a pilot program to support communities in building capacity and technical support for climate resilience. The program will recruit, train, and embed AmeriCorps VISTA members in these cities to increase civic engagement and community resilience in low-income areas. The selected cities include Anchorage, Boulder, Chicago, El Paso, Minot, New Orleans, Norfolk, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, and Tulsa. Each city will focus on different resilience challenges, such as energy efficiency, disaster response, infrastructure improvement, and community engagement. The program will also provide federal tools and support, improve electric reliability and resilience, and provide better support to communities. The Resilience AmeriCorps program aims to help communities identify and prepare for climate-related risks and develop community preparedness plans. The program is a public-private partnership between CNCS, The Rockefeller Foundation, and Cities of Service.
