President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House regarding the suspension of duty-free treatment for all AGOA-eligible goods in the agricultural sector for the Republic of South Africa. This decision was made due to South Africa's imposition of longstanding barriers to U.S. trade, particularly in the agricultural sector. President Obama believes that the suspension of benefits will be more effective in promoting compliance than the termination of South Africa's designation as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country. However, he acknowledges that South Africa has expressed an interest in resolving these concerns and will continue to assess their progress in eliminating trade barriers.
