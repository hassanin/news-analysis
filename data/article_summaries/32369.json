The article discusses the passing of the MISSION Act, which aims to improve healthcare for veterans in the United States. The law gives the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the ability to provide veterans with the best healthcare possible, whether at VA health care facilities or with community providers. The legislation received overwhelming bipartisan support and the backing of veterans service organizations. The MISSION Act will consolidate the department's community care efforts into a single, easy-to-use program that empowers veterans to choose their healthcare providers. The implementation of the act is set to take place on June 6, 2019, and is expected to result in less bureaucracy, increased patient satisfaction, improved efficiency for clinicians, and better value for taxpayers.
