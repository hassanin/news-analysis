The Biden-Harris Administration has taken steps to protect and conserve outdoor spaces and historical sites in the United States. President Biden has signed a proclamation establishing the Camp Hale – Continental Divide National Monument in Colorado. This monument honors veterans, Indigenous people, and their legacy while supporting jobs and the outdoor recreation economy. Additionally, the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior have proposed a withdrawal to protect the Thompson Divide in western Colorado.

The Camp Hale – Continental Divide National Monument holds historical significance as the training grounds for the 10th Mountain Division, the Army's first mountain infantry division, during World War II. It is also culturally important to the Ute Tribes and features diverse ecosystems and wildlife. The monument will be managed by the Forest Service and will continue to support recreational activities such as skiing, hiking, and camping.

The proposed withdrawal of the Thompson Divide area aims to protect its wildlife habitat, recreation opportunities, grazing lands, and clean air and water. The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service have submitted a withdrawal petition to the Secretary of the Interior, initiating a two-year segregation that would prohibit new mining claims and Federal mineral leases in the area.

Furthermore, the Biden-Harris Administration is addressing the historic drought in the Colorado River Basin through the Inflation Reduction Act. The act provides funding for water infrastructure improvements and conservation efforts. A portion of the funding will be allocated to the Lower Colorado River Basin System Conservation and Efficiency Program, benefiting communities, tribes, and irrigators in Arizona, California, and Nevada.

The Antiquities Act, first used by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, has been utilized by multiple presidents to protect natural and historic features in the United States.
