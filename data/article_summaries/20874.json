Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, John Brennan, called Yemeni President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi to express President Obama's condolences for a terrorist attack in Sana'a that killed and injured over 100 Yemeni soldiers. Brennan condemned the violence and offered U.S. assistance in the investigation. President Hadi thanked the U.S. for their support and pledged to continue the fight against al-Qa'ida. Both parties reaffirmed the partnership between Yemen and the United States and Hadi promised not to let terrorist acts disrupt Yemen's peaceful political transition.
