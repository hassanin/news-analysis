Five years ago, a shooting at a College Night in Thousand Oaks, California, resulted in the loss of twelve lives. Since then, numerous communities across the country have also been affected by gun violence. The President is committed to addressing this issue through various measures, including the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, executive actions, and the establishment of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. The President is urging Republicans in Congress to support common-sense gun safety policies such as banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. On the anniversary of the Thousand Oaks attack, thoughts are with the victims, survivors, and those mourning their loved ones. The President calls for action to end the nation's gun violence epidemic.
