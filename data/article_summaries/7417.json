In honor of National Donate Life Month, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recognizes the generosity and courage of organ donors and their families. He urges everyone to register as organ, eye, tissue, or bone marrow donors to bring hope and healing to those in need. Despite the milestone of one million organ transplants completed in the United States last year, there are still over 100,000 people on the waiting list, including 1,900 children. The President emphasizes that each person has the power to save lives and improve the quality of life for many others through organ donation. The administration is actively working to support organ donation and ensure affordable healthcare for living donors and recipients. Efforts are also being made to modernize the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) to better serve patients and families. Additionally, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health has been launched to fund breakthroughs in disease prevention, detection, and treatment, potentially reducing the need for transplants in the future. President Biden encourages all Americans to become organ donors and provides resources for more information on organ, eye, tissue, and bone marrow donation. He proclaims April 2023 as National Donate Life Month and calls for the observance of National Pediatric Transplant Week to address the pediatric transplant waiting list.
