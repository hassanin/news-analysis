In a recent teleconference, senior administration officials discussed the historic agreement reached between Israel and Lebanon to formally end their maritime boundary dispute and establish a permanent maritime boundary. The negotiations, mediated by the United States, have been ongoing for years and recently resumed in late 2021. The agreement aims to provide economic opportunities and stability for both countries. For Lebanon, it offers the potential for foreign direct investment, exploration of hydrocarbon resources, and improvement in the energy conditions of the country. Israel, on the other hand, gains security and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, allowing it to continue relying on its gas resources and potentially exporting them. The agreement does not address any threats from Hezbollah, but both parties have expressed their commitment to avoiding conflict and pursuing their economic interests. The details of the agreement, including compensation for potential developments and the Arab Gas Pipeline, will be addressed by the governments of Israel and Lebanon. Despite criticism from some former officials, the agreement is considered historic and beneficial for both parties. The timing of the agreement, just days before the Israeli elections, has raised some political discussions, but the focus remains on the substantive benefits for both countries.
