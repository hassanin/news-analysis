Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced funding for 191 new Recovery Act transit projects in 42 states and Puerto Rico. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) met its aggressive deadline to award 100 percent of its Recovery Act transit formula dollars by March 5. Since the signing of the Recovery Act in February 2009, the FTA has awarded 881 grants totaling $7.5 billion. These funds have been committed to specific transit projects, allowing contracts to be bid, workers to be hired, and work to begin on transit construction projects that create jobs and drive economic growth. Recovery Act transit projects have already generated enough work to employ thousands of people nationwide, with activity expected to increase as new projects break ground and equipment orders are fulfilled. The investments not only put construction workers on the job but also support American manufacturing jobs throughout the supply chain. The Recovery Act has also supported the purchase of buses, vans, and rail vehicles, the construction or renovation of transit facilities, and preventive maintenance. In addition to the direct employment impact, domestic bus, seating, and rail car manufacturers have received orders that are helping to boost production and support jobs. The U.S. Department of Transportation has made $48.1 billion available through the Recovery Act for all transportation projects, with $36.8 billion already awarded.
