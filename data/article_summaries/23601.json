The Obama Administration has launched the Quadrennial Energy Review (QER), which will focus on the development of a comprehensive strategy for the infrastructure involved in transporting, transmitting, and delivering energy. This review will study the opportunities and challenges faced by the energy infrastructure due to transformations in energy supply, markets, and use, as well as issues of aging and capacity, climate change, and cyber and physical threats. The QER will provide rigorous analysis and recommendations for policymakers, and will include broad outreach to the private sector, government entities, labor organizations, and the academic community. The Department of Energy will play a key role in providing analytical support. The review aims to provide an integrated view of federal energy policy, assess the adequacy of existing activities, recommend additional actions, prioritize research and development programs, and identify analytical tools and data needed for policy development and implementation. The QER will help policymakers make decisions based on unbiased data and rigorous analysis in the face of an aging infrastructure and changing energy landscape.
