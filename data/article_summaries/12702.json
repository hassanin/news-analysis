President Barack Obama has proclaimed January 2016 as National Stalking Awareness Month in the United States. The proclamation highlights the seriousness of stalking as a violation of fundamental freedoms and emphasizes the need to bring stalkers to justice. Stalking affects people from all walks of life and is often perpetrated by individuals known to the victims. It can involve various means of harassment, such as text messages, emails, and phone calls. Stalking not only breaches privacy and liberty but also causes victims to feel scared and anxious, potentially leading to post-traumatic stress symptoms. The proclamation mentions the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 2013, which recognizes stalking as a crime and provides more resources for victims. The Act also includes protections for LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and Native American women. The President's Executive Order allows victims to use sick leave for stalking-related absences and protects their privacy in the workplace. The 2016 budget proposal includes additional funding to help stalked individuals make emergency moves to safer housing. Institutions of higher education are also required to collect and report information on stalking and other crimes, making their disciplinary processes more transparent and providing prevention and awareness campaigns. The proclamation urges Americans to recognize the signs of stalking, acknowledge it as a serious crime, and support victims and survivors.
