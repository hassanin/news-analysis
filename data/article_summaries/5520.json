On November 14, 1979, the President declared a national emergency with respect to Iran due to the threat it posed to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The emergency measures taken at that time are still in effect and will continue beyond November 14, 2023. The President is renewing the national emergency for 1 year in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This renewal is separate from the emergency declared in 1995 and the renewal in March 2023. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
