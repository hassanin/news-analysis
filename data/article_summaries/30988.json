President Donald Trump's leadership has resulted in North Korea committing to return the remains of American service members who died in the Korean War. This agreement is significant for many families in America and demonstrates the President's unwavering dedication to those who have served in the US military. As a result, Vice President Mike Pence has been asked to travel to Hawaii on August 1 to participate in the Honorable Carry Ceremony and receive the remains as they are brought back to American soil. Being the son of a Korean War combat veteran, Pence finds it deeply humbling to be part of this historic moment and emphasizes the importance of never forgetting the sacrifices made by these brave service members and their families.
