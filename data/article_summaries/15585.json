President Obama and Vice President Biden have announced a roadmap to recovery in order to accelerate the implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. They have set key targets for the second 100 days of the Act, including enabling health centers to provide expanded services, beginning work on national parks, airports, and highways, funding education jobs, improving veterans medical centers, hiring law enforcement officers, starting waste and water systems in rural America, initiating cleanup work at Superfund sites, creating summer youth jobs, and initiating construction and rehabilitation projects at military facilities. The roadmap aims to create or save over 600,000 jobs in the second 100 days, four times the number in the first 100 days. A new website, WhiteHouse.gov/Recovery, has been launched to allow the public to follow the progress of the Recovery Act and share their stories. Since the Act was enacted, over 150,000 jobs have been created or saved and over $135 billion has been obligated to programs and projects.
