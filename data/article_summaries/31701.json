President Trump has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, proposing an alternative plan for pay adjustments for civilian Federal employees in January 2019. The current law mandates a locality pay increase of 25.70% in addition to a 2.1% across-the-board increase for the base General Schedule. However, President Trump argues that these increases are inappropriate due to the fiscal situation of the country. Therefore, he has determined that both across-the-board pay increases and locality pay increases will be set at zero for 2019. The President believes that Federal employee pay should be performance-based and strategically aligned to attract and retain high-performing employees. The proposed changes will take effect in January 2019.
