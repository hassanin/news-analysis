American Business Women's Day is a day to recognize and celebrate the contributions of women in strengthening the American economy. Women make up 47% of the labor force and hold over 51% of management and professional positions. They are also now the majority of the college-educated labor force. Despite progress, there is still work to be done to support and empower women. The President's National Council for the American Worker and the Pledge to America's Workers initiative have been established to provide training and education opportunities. Since the current administration took office, over 6.3 million jobs have been added to the economy, with wage growth at its highest pace in a decade. The unemployment rate is near record lows, including among minorities. Minority female-owned firms have also contributed to job growth and economic success.
