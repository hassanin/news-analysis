Senator Mark Udall expressed his support for the American Jobs Act following President Obama's speech about job creation and boosting the economy. He emphasized the need for Congress to work together in a bipartisan manner to get the job done. Udall praised the president's proposal, which included tax cuts for working families and investments in infrastructure, as practical and responsible. He also urged the president to consider his own job creation bills, which aim to lift regulations and allow businesses to expand. Udall sat with GOP Senator Lisa Murkowski during the speech as a symbolic gesture of bipartisanship.
