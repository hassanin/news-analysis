On October 20, 2009, President Barack Obama issued a notice stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This national emergency was initially declared on October 27, 2006, through Executive Order 13413. The President took this action to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States posed by the widespread violence and atrocities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The measures adopted in response to this emergency, which involved blocking the property of certain individuals contributing to the conflict, must continue beyond October 27, 2009. This continuation is in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. The notice was published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
