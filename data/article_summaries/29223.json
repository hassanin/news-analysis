President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Alabama and ordered federal assistance to support recovery efforts in areas affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes on April 19, 2020. The federal funding will be available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Barbour, Chilton, Coffee, Coosa, Covington, Crenshaw, Dale, Henry, Pike, and Tallapoosa are included in the declaration. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Terry L.
