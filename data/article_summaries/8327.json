The Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to disrupt the trafficking of illicit fentanyl and dismantle firearms trafficking networks. Firearms enable drug traffickers to expand their operations and bring deadly drugs, including illicit fentanyl, into the United States. These weapons are used against the Mexican people, including law enforcement and military personnel. To combat this issue, the administration is focusing on expanding firearms trafficking investigations, holding traffickers accountable, countering the rise of ghost guns and other dangerous weapons, stemming the supply of illegal guns, and deepening collaboration with Mexico. They are also prioritizing U.S. outbound operations and enforcement and driving ongoing research in this area.
