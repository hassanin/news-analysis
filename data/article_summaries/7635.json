The Biden-Harris Administration has released the National Cybersecurity Strategy, aiming to secure a safe and secure digital ecosystem for all Americans. The strategy focuses on achieving economic security, respecting human rights, promoting trust in democracy, and fostering an equitable and diverse society. It recognizes the need for a coordinated approach to protect national security, public safety, and economic prosperity. The strategy emphasizes collaboration in five key areas: defending critical infrastructure, disrupting and dismantling threat actors, shaping market forces for security and resilience, investing in a resilient future, and forging international partnerships. The implementation of the strategy is already underway, led by the Office of the National Cyber Director.
