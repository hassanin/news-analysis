On December 1, 2016, President Barack Obama issued a Presidential Determination (No. 2017-3) to suspend limitations under the Jerusalem Embassy Act. This act, passed in 1995, aimed to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The President determined that it was necessary to protect the national security interests of the United States to suspend the limitations set forth in sections 3(b) and 7(b) of the Act for a period of 6 months. The Secretary of State was instructed to transmit this determination to Congress, along with a report, and to publish the determination in the Federal Register. The suspension would take effect after the transmission of the determination and report to Congress.
