President Donald Trump has implemented a new rule requiring healthcare systems to provide Americans with secure access and control of their health records. This rule allows patients to easily share their records with family members and care providers, choose their own doctors and treatments, and avoid redundant medical tests and record collection processes. The seamless transfer of Electronic Health Records prioritizes patients' needs, allowing doctors to spend more time with patients and less time on paperwork. Additionally, this rule will facilitate medical research by providing scientists with faster and more powerful ways to analyze health data. The Obama/Biden Administration previously invested $36 billion in Electronic Health Records, but access to full health records remains limited. President Trump aims to address this issue and create a healthcare system where patients have control, including the ability to shop for care, understand what they're receiving, and know the associated costs.
