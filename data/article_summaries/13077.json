President Obama expresses his satisfaction with the passing of H.R. 3962, which ensures the security of seniors' healthcare. He emphasizes that a 21% pay cut to physicians' payments would have led to some doctors no longer accepting Medicare patients, which is unacceptable. However, he also states that delaying these cuts is not a sufficient solution and that the current system of recurring cuts and temporary fixes is untenable. The President believes that a permanent reform of the Medicare formula is necessary to address fiscal problems without penalizing hard-working doctors or endangering seniors' benefits. He looks forward to collaborating with Congress to achieve this goal and commends them for temporarily blocking the pay cut.
