The White House is proposing an alternative plan for pay increases for civilian federal employees in January 2016. This plan is being implemented due to "national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare." The plan aims to maintain a sustainable fiscal course for the nation, as federal agency budgets cannot sustain the current locality pay increases. The proposed plan includes locality-based comparability payments, based on an allocation of 0.3 percent of payroll, which will not significantly affect the ability to attract and retain qualified federal workers. These adjustments will take effect in the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
