The article discusses a statement made by the Press Secretary regarding the supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. The analysis shows that global oil consumption has exceeded production, resulting in a small withdrawal from global oil stocks. However, disruptions in global oil supply have been offset by increased petroleum production, particularly in the United States. Although there appears to be sufficient supply of non-Iranian oil to reduce purchases of Iranian oil, the United States has committed to pausing efforts to further reduce Iran's crude oil sales for a 6-month period. This is in accordance with the Joint Plan of Action between the P5+1 and Iran, where Iran has agreed to take steps to halt and roll back progress on its nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency has verified Iran's compliance with these commitments.
