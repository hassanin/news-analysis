President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as the health insurance reform bill, into law. The bill not only reduces the deficit and makes healthcare more affordable for millions of Americans, but it also permanently reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. The act was first approved by Congress in 1976 and aims to address the healthcare disparities faced by Native American communities. The reauthorization of this act is seen as a critical step in modernizing the Indian health care system and improving access to healthcare for American Indians and Alaska Natives.
