The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed the first case of the Omicron variant in the United States. The President has stated that it was expected for the variant to be detected in the country. The President's medical team believes that existing vaccines will still provide some level of protection against severe illness from Omicron, and individuals who have received booster shots have even stronger protection. Therefore, the administration is urging all adults to get their booster shots and to vaccinate themselves and their children if they haven't already. The President will announce the strategy for fighting COVID this winter tomorrow. It is emphasized that the Omicron variant should be approached with vigilance, not panic. The known measures to limit the spread of COVID, such as getting vaccinated, getting boosted, and practicing masking and social distancing, should continue to be followed. The administration is committed to fighting the virus and will be guided by science and proven public health measures to ensure people's safety.
