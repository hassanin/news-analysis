President Donald J. Trump awarded the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor to five first responders for their heroic efforts during the shooting incident in Alexandria, Virginia on June 14, 2017. The recipients of the medal were Special Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner of the United States Capitol Police, and Officers Nicole Battaglia, Kevin Jobe, and Alexander Jensen of the Alexandria Police Department. These officers were on the field when a heavily-armed assailant opened fire, and their bravery saved numerous lives. President Trump also announced that twelve other recipients from 2015-2016 will be honored with the Medal of Valor at a later date.
