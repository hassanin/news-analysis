The joint statement by the Presidents of the United States and Russia emphasizes the importance of counterterrorism cooperation. They recognize that terrorism is a major threat to global peace and security. Recent events, such as the bombing at Domodedovo Airport and the attempt to put bombs on cargo planes, highlight the need to strengthen joint efforts against this threat. The statement outlines various areas of cooperation, including law enforcement, transportation security, intelligence sharing, combating terrorism finance, and counterterrorism technology. They also intend to work together in multilateral organizations such as the United Nations and the Global Counterterrorism Forum. The protection of the traveling public is a key focus, and they plan to enhance security measures in airports and other modes of transportation. The Presidents reaffirm their commitment to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaâ€™ida, and they welcome the actions taken by the United States to designate Doku Umarov and his group as terrorists and offer a reward for information on Umarov. They are pleased with the progress made so far but acknowledge the need for further cooperation to promote international security and bring terrorists to justice.
