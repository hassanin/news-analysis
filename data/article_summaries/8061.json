The article is a tribute to Herb Kohl, describing him as a kind and principled man of integrity and character. It highlights his rise from being a bag boy in his father's market to building an iconic retail chain and owning the Milwaukee Bucks. As a Senator, he prioritized work and responsibility over personal gain, focusing on the common good. Kohl's accomplishments include passing significant gun safety legislation, supporting community policing and juvenile justice programs, and advocating for workers and a fair economy. He also fought for farmers, food safety, affordable healthcare, childcare, education, and prescription drugs. The article emphasizes Kohl's care for the people he served and his humility as a source of strength. The author, Jill, and I send condolences to his family, friends, and the people of Wisconsin, recognizing Kohl as the best of what America represents.
