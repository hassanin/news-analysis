The article discusses the recent expansion of Medicaid in North Carolina, which allows 600,000 residents to access affordable and quality healthcare. Governor Roy Cooper's leadership, along with bipartisan support, has led to North Carolina becoming the 40th state to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. This expansion will immediately provide coverage to 300,000 people and help rural hospitals stay operational. However, there are still concerns as some Republicans, who support the "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) movement, want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Repealing the law would jeopardize the healthcare of the 40 million Americans who rely on it, including those in North Carolina who benefit from Medicaid expansion. The article calls for strengthening the Affordable Care Act instead of getting rid of it, and encourages collaboration to lower healthcare and prescription drug costs while expanding Medicaid in the remaining states. The author emphasizes their commitment to preventing the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
