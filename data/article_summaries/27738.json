The executive order issued by President Donald Trump on April 24, 2019, transfers the primary responsibility for conducting background investigations from the Office of Personnel Management to the Department of Defense. The order also renames the Defense Security Service (DSS) as the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) and assigns it the role of conducting background investigations for the federal government. The DCSA will be responsible for determining the suitability, fitness, and eligibility of individuals for access to classified information or sensitive positions within the Department of Defense. The order also includes provisions for the transfer of functions, resources, and personnel from the Office of Personnel Management to the DCSA, as well as the development of information technology systems to support personnel vetting processes. The order further requires a review of vetting policies and the submission of recommendations for any necessary legislative, regulatory, or policy changes.
