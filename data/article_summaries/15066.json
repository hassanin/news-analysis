In this press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney addressed several topics. Regarding Mitt Romney's speech at the NAACP meeting, Carney stated that President Obama's policies have been focused on helping all Americans recover from the recession, particularly middle-class families. He also mentioned that the President's policies, such as the Recovery Act and his call to extend middle-class tax cuts, will benefit all Americans, including African Americans and other minority communities. Carney also addressed questions about the President's decision not to attend the NAACP meeting, saying that the President has addressed the organization in the past and has met with Ben Jealous to discuss concerns in the African American community. On the topic of Syria, Carney stated that Iran's role in the crisis has not been constructive and that the US is focused on working with international partners who want to play a positive role in resolving the situation. Carney also discussed the issue of outsourcing and tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, stating that the President supports a tax code that creates incentives for companies to bring jobs back to the US. He mentioned that there is a constituency in Congress that supports tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, which has hindered progress on this issue. Carney also addressed questions about the looming fiscal cliff and the sequester, stating that the President has proposed a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes revenue increases, entitlement reform, and discretionary spending cuts. He called on Congress to take action to avoid the sequester by passing balanced deficit reduction measures.
