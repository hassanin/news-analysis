Vice President Kamala Harris announced the largest investment in child care in US history, as part of the American Rescue Plan. She provided updates on the implementation of the plan, including the distribution of checks to American households, funding for vaccine administration, support for schools and unemployment insurance. The Vice President highlighted the challenges faced by child care providers and parents during the pandemic, with many child care centers closing down and parents unable to work due to lack of affordable child care. The $39 billion investment will help child care centers and family providers reopen or stay open by covering expenses such as rent, utilities, and insurance. It will also make child care more affordable for families through subsidies and an expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. The Vice President emphasized the importance of child care in enabling parents, especially women, to work and contribute to society. She concluded by expressing hope for the future and the positive impact the American Rescue Plan will have on the American people.
