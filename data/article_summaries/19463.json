President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Maryland and authorized federal aid to assist in recovery efforts following severe storms and straight-line winds that occurred between June 29 and July 8, 2012. The federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also be eligible for funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Regis Leo Phelan has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
