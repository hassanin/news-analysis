The White House has announced a renewed commitment to the Power Africa initiative, aimed at increasing access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa. The goal is to add 30,000 MW of additional capacity to Africa and increase electricity access by at least 60 million household and business connections. The President has pledged $300 million in assistance per year, bringing the total private sector commitments to over $20 billion. Power Africa has already facilitated the financial closure of transactions expected to generate almost 2,800 MW of electricity and is actively supporting transactions expected to generate an additional 5,000 MW. The initiative has also formed strategic partnerships with African governments, multilateral institutions, donors, and the private sector to maximize impact and accelerate private sector investment in renewable energy. Additionally, the article highlights various specific projects and partnerships that have been undertaken as part of the Power Africa initiative.
