This article discusses a presidential memorandum issued by Donald J. Trump on December 8, 2017. The memorandum addresses the submission of a report by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA). The TFTEA requires the SBA to submit a report on the economic impacts of a covered trade agreement on small businesses within 180 days of convening an Interagency Working Group for the relevant trade agreement. The report for the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is soon due. However, to prevent disruption of the negotiations, President Trump has directed the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA to delay the submission of the report until after the negotiations are concluded, but not later than 30 days after a renegotiated agreement is signed. The memorandum also states that the report should be submitted to Congress not later than 45 days before the Senate or the House of Representatives acts to approve or disapprove the trade agreement.
