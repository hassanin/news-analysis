The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has reached a milestone with a record-breaking 20 million Americans enrolling in health care coverage through the ACA marketplaces. This is 8 million more than when the current administration took office. The ACA is more popular than ever and coverage is more affordable, with millions of Americans saving hundreds or thousands of dollars each year on health insurance premiums. Efforts to make lower health care premiums permanent are being blocked by extreme Republicans who want to repeal the ACA. If repealed, it would strip coverage from 20 million people, end Medicaid coverage for millions more, and allow insurance companies to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions and charge women more than men. The current administration is committed to fighting against these efforts and continues to work towards bringing down health care and prescription drug costs. Americans are encouraged to visit HealthCare.gov to sign up for health coverage before January 16th.
