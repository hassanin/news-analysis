Former Congressman William H. Gray III, known as Bill Gray, has passed away. He was a trailblazer, being the first African-American to chair the Budget Committee and serve as the Majority Whip in Congress. Gray's leadership was instrumental in various areas such as housing, transportation, and supporting efforts to end apartheid in South Africa. The President and Michelle Obama extend their condolences to Gray's family, particularly his wife Andrea and their three sons.
