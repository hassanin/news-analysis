President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Texas due to severe storms and flooding that occurred in October 2013. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding is available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The counties of Caldwell, Hays, and Travis are specifically mentioned, but additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. William J. Doran III has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
