President Biden announced that a bipartisan budget agreement has been reached with Speaker McCarthy, which will be moved to the full Congress. This agreement takes the threat of catastrophic default off the table and protects the economic recovery. It is a compromise that protects key priorities such as Social Security, Medicare, and veterans. President Biden emphasized the importance of bipartisan cooperation and urged both chambers to pass the agreement. He clarified that the negotiations were about the budget, not the debt ceiling, and that he did not compromise on the debt ceiling itself. When asked about concessions made in the deal, President Biden stated that he did not make too many concessions. He also mentioned that the process of handling the deficit and debt has happened before and will likely happen again, but it is not expected to happen for at least another two years. President Biden does not believe it is time to get rid of the debt limit but mentioned exploring the idea of the 14th Amendment's impact on reducing the debt limit in the future. He confirmed that Speaker McCarthy negotiated in good faith and expressed confidence that he has the votes needed for the agreement. President Biden has not yet spoken to President ErdoÄŸan of Turkey regarding the elections. He dismissed claims that the policy will lead to people going hungry as a ridiculous assertion. Lastly, President Biden stated that starting negotiations sooner would not have made a difference.
