Former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez Gonzalez of Spain has passed away. He was the first elected prime minister after the restoration of democracy in Spain and played a crucial role in transitioning the country to a more pluralistic society, free market economy, and parliamentary system of government. He helped Spain become a leader in the international community and an example to other countries striving for freedom, openness, rule of law, and economic development. The American people extend their condolences to his family and the Spanish people.
