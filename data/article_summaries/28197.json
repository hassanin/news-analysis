Vice President Mike Pence held a press briefing to provide an update on the status of negotiations regarding the border wall and the ongoing government shutdown. Pence stated that the negotiations were productive, but did not indicate that progress had been made. He emphasized that there is a humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border and called on Democrats to start negotiating. Pence also discussed the White House's proposal, which includes funding for a steel barrier, additional immigration judges, increased border patrol agents, and enhanced medical support. He mentioned that the President is considering the possibility of declaring a national emergency to fund the border wall. Pence expressed hope that a resolution could be reached before federal employees miss their paychecks on Friday.
