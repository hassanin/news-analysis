A recent survey of business executives suggests that the U.S. economy is experiencing its strongest growth in over two decades, indicating a strong finish for 2018. The Institute for Supply Management's survey of non-manufacturing firms reached a 21-year high of 61.6 in September, the highest mark in the current nine-year expansion. All 17 industries tracked by the ISM reported growth, with many companies seeing an increase in new orders and hiring more workers. The survey indicates that the economy is expected to continue growing and the recent trade agreement with Canada is likely to alleviate concerns for corporate America.
