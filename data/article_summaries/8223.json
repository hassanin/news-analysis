President Biden has issued a new executive order, titled "Bolstering Efforts to Bring Hostages and Wrongfully Detained United States Nationals Home," reaffirming his commitment to bringing home Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. The executive order expands the tools available to deter and disrupt hostage-taking and wrongful detentions, imposing costs on terrorist organizations, criminal groups, and other actors who engage in such activities. 

The order also introduces a new risk indicator, the "D" indicator, to the State Department's Travel Advisories. This indicator informs American travelers of the risk of wrongful detention by foreign governments, providing comprehensive safety and security information to help them make informed travel decisions. It joins the existing "K" indicator, which covers the risk of kidnapping and hostage-taking by non-state actors.

The executive order builds upon the 2020 Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act and reinforces the administration's commitment to bringing Americans home. It is informed by regular communications with families and stakeholders who advocate for their loved ones, considering them essential partners in the efforts to reunite hostages and wrongfully detained individuals with their families.

President Biden and experts across the administration will utilize this executive order to advance their efforts and remain dedicated to reuniting Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained with their families.
