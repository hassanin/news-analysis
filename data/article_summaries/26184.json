On November 1, 2018, President Donald J. Trump issued Executive Orders on Foreign Policy. The orders were issued under the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act, and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The purpose of these orders was to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692 of March 8, 2015, and to address the actions of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. The orders block the property and interests in property of certain individuals and entities, suspend the entry of aliens determined to meet certain criteria, prohibit certain donations, and impose other prohibitions and restrictions. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State are authorized to take actions necessary to implement these orders. The orders also include definitions and provisions regarding the implementation and enforcement of the measures.
