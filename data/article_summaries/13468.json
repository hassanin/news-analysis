The White House has released a strategy to reduce methane emissions as part of its Climate Action Plan. The plan outlines steps to cut methane emissions from landfills, coal mining, agriculture, and oil and gas systems through voluntary actions and common-sense standards. Key steps include proposing updated standards for reducing methane from landfills, developing a program for capturing and selling waste mine methane, releasing a "Biogas Roadmap" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the dairy sector, assessing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, and proposing updated standards for reducing venting and flaring from oil and gas production on public lands. Methane emissions make up nearly 9 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, and reducing these emissions is crucial for addressing climate change. The policies in the methane strategy will not only improve public health and safety but also generate clean energy and create jobs.
