The Commerce Department has released a notice of funding opportunity for companies applying to make major investments in the semiconductor industry in America. One novel requirement is that recipients must provide childcare for all their workers. This move is seen as a pragmatic way to increase the workforce necessary for building and producing chips in the country. Experts agree that lack of affordable childcare is a real problem in the US and is keeping millions of people out of the workforce. They believe that providing childcare is essential for securing America's role as a leader in technology and manufacturing. Additionally, the lack of affordable childcare is a drag on business owners who struggle to hire and retain workers. The move by the Biden administration to require childcare as a condition for federal subsidies is seen as a promising development. It is believed that childcare issues are intertwined with the economy and employment, and addressing them is crucial for achieving the national security goals of the CHIPS initiative.
