On November 3, 2012, President Obama held a briefing at the FEMA headquarters to discuss the response and recovery efforts to Hurricane Sandy. He was joined by several members of his team, including Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate. The President received an update on federal efforts to support state and local response activities and spoke with state and local officials, including Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. They discussed challenges related to power generation, fuel shortages, and housing needs. The President directed his team to continue identifying and removing any barriers to the movement of necessary resources. He also announced that the Defense Logistics Agency would purchase millions of gallons of fuel to distribute in impacted areas. The President thanked the officials for their hard work and praised the efforts of first responders. Administration officials planned to visit storm-damaged communities to assess the response efforts and ensure resources were reaching those in need.
