President Obama has declared a major disaster in Montana due to ice jams and flooding that occurred from March 1-16, 2014. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in various counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding. Gary R. Stanley has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
