Senior executives from major U.S.-based manufacturers and distributors of water infrastructure parts have announced new investments and hiring commitments in response to President Biden's Investing in America agenda. The agenda includes a historic $50 billion investment in the nation's water infrastructure, with $15 billion set aside for lead service line replacement. This investment aims to not only fix the country's water systems and replace lead pipes but also create good-paying jobs and stimulate domestic manufacturing. The administration is prioritizing the use of Made in-America products when using federal funding for infrastructure rebuilding. The firms that made the announcements this week are committing tens of millions of dollars to manufacturing investments and hiring. The Biden-Harris Administration is making tangible progress on the Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan, aiming to replace all lead service lines in America in the next decade. All investments under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are subject to the Build America, Buy America Act, which requires the use of American-made products. President Biden's approach to industrial policy has resulted in the creation of nearly 800,000 new manufacturing jobs and over $480 billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments since taking office. These recent announcements demonstrate the administration's commitment to creating jobs, rebuilding manufacturing capacity, and ensuring access to clean and safe drinking water for all.
