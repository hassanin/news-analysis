The First Lady, Michelle Obama, visited the United States Army Garrison Vicenza in Italy as part of the Joining Forces initiative. She attended a barbeque hosted by the base and the USO, where she thanked the service members and their families for their sacrifices. Mrs. Obama, along with her daughters and mother, served lunch to the troops and families in attendance. She also met with the children of service members and read books to a group of 300 military-connected school children. Each child received a selection of new books contributed by Disney and Blue Star Families. The First Lady then joined a roundtable discussion with soon-to-be and new moms on base to discuss the challenges of raising military families while stationed overseas.
