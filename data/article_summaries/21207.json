Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, Ben Rhodes, held a press briefing to discuss President Obama's upcoming trip to Poland, Belgium, and France. The trip comes at an important time in the Transatlantic relationship as the US seeks to reaffirm its commitments to European allies, deepen cooperation, and pursue an agenda that strengthens the security and economic foundations of the Transatlantic partnership. The President's objectives for the trip include supporting Ukraine, strengthening NATO, diversifying European energy security, and negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The President's schedule includes meetings with Polish President Komorowski and Prime Minister Tusk, a meeting with President-elect Poroshenko of Ukraine, attending the G7 summit, and commemorating the 70th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. The President will also address the crisis in Ukraine, the rise of far-right parties in Europe, and discuss energy issues and climate change. There are no plans for a formal meeting between President Obama and President Putin. The President's speech in Warsaw will focus on the importance of alliances and collective action in protecting democratic values and security. The President will also address the importance of the D-Day anniversary in Normandy and connect the service of the D-Day generation to the service of the 9/11 generation. The President will discuss energy diversification, climate change, and potential additional pressure on Russia. The President will also address the situation of the Crimean Tatars and the importance of respecting human rights.
