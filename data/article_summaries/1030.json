National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had a conversation with General Nikolay Patrushev, Secretary of the Russian Security Council, to express the United States' strong opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sullivan emphasized that the US will continue to impose costs on Russia, support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and reinforce NATO's eastern flank in coordination with allies. He urged Russia to halt attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns if they are serious about diplomacy. Sullivan also warned about the potential consequences of Russia's use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.
