President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the signing ceremony for the National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. They highlighted the importance of teaching and understanding the history of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders in America. The museum will tell the story of their contributions to the nation, as well as the discrimination and challenges they have faced. President Biden emphasized the need to learn from both the best and darkest moments of American history to ensure they are never repeated. The signing of the bill marks a significant step towards the creation of the museum, which will join other national museums that celebrate the contributions of diverse communities in America.
