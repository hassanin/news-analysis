The article discusses the GOP's tax reform plan and the criticisms it has faced from Democrats and the media. The GOP budget outline allows for a net tax cut of $1.5 trillion over a decade, which critics argue will bust the budget and add to the federal debt. However, the article points out that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has historically underestimated the growth and revenue feedback from tax cuts. It also argues that the CBO's projection of average economic growth of 1.9% a year is too low, as the U.S. economy has never grown that slowly for so long. The article also addresses the claim that the GOP bills are merely a tax cut without any reform, highlighting the elimination of loopholes and business carve-outs in the bills. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of the reform as a vote of confidence in better policies that can restore America's economic vigor.
