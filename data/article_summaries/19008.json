The United States is disappointed with Egypt's decision to extend the State of Emergency, which has been in effect since 1981. The US calls on Egypt to replace the Emergency Law with a counterterrorism law that protects the civil liberties of its citizens. Although Egypt has committed to applying a revised Emergency Law limited to counterterrorism and counter-narcotics cases, this law still grants the government extraordinary powers to restrict citizens' rights. The US believes in the universal values of free speech, assembly, and the right to choose leaders, and will support them everywhere. The US urges Egypt to complete its promised counterterrorism legislation urgently and repeal the State of Emergency. While acknowledging the challenges of terrorism, the US believes effective counterterrorism measures can be based on legal principles that protect citizens' rights. Egypt has the legal and judicial expertise to draft and adopt counterterrorism legislation that aligns with international standards for civil liberties and due process. The US sees Egypt's decision as a missed opportunity to signal its embrace of these universal values to the world and urges the government to fulfill its promises to its citizens. The US remains committed to a strong partnership with Egypt and dialogue on all issues of concern to both countries.
