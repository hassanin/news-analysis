The United States has warned that the Assad regime in Syria is potentially preparing for another chemical weapons attack. The US believes that such an attack would result in the mass murder of civilians, including innocent children. The activities being observed are similar to those seen before the April 2017 chemical weapons attack. While the primary objective of the US in Syria is to eliminate ISIS, they have stated that if Assad conducts another attack, he and his military will face severe consequences.
