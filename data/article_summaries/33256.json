The President's Commission on White House Fellows has announced the appointment of the 2017-2018 class of White House Fellows. The program provides professionals from diverse backgrounds with the opportunity to engage in public service for one year by serving in various roles in the federal government. The selection process is highly competitive and based on professional accomplishment, leadership skills, and a commitment to public service. The fellows will work as full-time, paid fellows to senior White House staff, Cabinet Secretaries, and other top-ranking government officials. The program also includes an education program to expand fellows' knowledge of leadership, policy-making, and contemporary issues, as well as community service projects.
