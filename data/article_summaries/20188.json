President Obama called Governor Jerry Brown to get an update on the fires in California, particularly the Rim fire that is affecting families, communities, businesses, and Yosemite National Park. The President expressed gratitude for the efforts of the firefighters and assured Governor Brown of the administration's commitment to providing federal resources to support the state and local response. FEMA has approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant for the Rim fire, offering federal assistance on a cost-sharing basis. The President urges residents to follow the instructions of state and local officials, including evacuation orders.
