President Obama has signed H.R. 4 into law, which aims to reduce burdens on small businesses. The law is intended to allow small business owners to focus on creating jobs and growing their business, rather than spending time on paperwork. The President expresses his willingness to work with Congress to improve the tax credit policy in this legislation and welcomes ideas to make health care more affordable and better.
