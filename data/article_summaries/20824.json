The United States congratulates Nepal on its recent Constituent Assembly elections. These elections are seen as a significant milestone in Nepal's peace process since the civil war that began in 2006. The elections are not only important for Nepal but also serve as an example for other nations working towards rebuilding after conflicts. The Nepali people have endured years of civil war, which led to violence and terrorism. However, since the end of the conflict, Nepal has made progress in supporting civil society, promoting the participation of women and youth, and becoming a pluralistic democracy. As Nepal's newly elected leaders work on concluding a constitution, the United States pledges its continued support in helping Nepal achieve peace, prosperity, inclusivity, and democracy.
