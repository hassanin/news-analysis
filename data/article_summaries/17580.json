In this letter, President Barack Obama expresses his support for the recommendations proposed by the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC). He believes that these recommendations are important for protecting the long-term viability of the All-Volunteer Force, improving the quality of life for service members and their families, and ensuring the fiscal sustainability of the military compensation and retirement systems. The President directs his team to consider and work with the Commission to adopt or refine the specific proposals. He plans to report to Congress by April 30, 2015, with proposals that he recommends be enacted without delay, while acknowledging that further analysis may be needed for some of the recommendations.
