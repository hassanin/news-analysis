President Obama has proposed $1.1 billion in new funding to address the prescription opioid abuse and heroin use epidemic in the United States. This funding will be used to expand access to treatment for prescription drug abuse and heroin use, and to support state-level prescription drug overdose prevention strategies. It will also be used to increase the availability of medication-assisted treatment programs and improve access to the overdose-reversal drug naloxone. The President's budget includes funding to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment programs and to expand access to substance use treatment providers. The budget also includes an HHS pilot project for nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder treatment. This proposal builds on previous efforts by the Administration to address the opioid epidemic, including the implementation of prescription drug monitoring programs, the expansion of access to naloxone, and the development of guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain.
