The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new actions and investments to maintain and improve aviation safety following Mike Whitaker's nomination to lead the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These initiatives include a $26 million investment in aviation safety, such as deploying surface surveillance systems to airports, expanding terminal automation systems, and deploying memory aid devices for runway incursions. The Administration is calling on Congress to support these safety efforts by confirming Mike Whitaker as FAA leader, reauthorizing the FAA in a timely manner, approving budget anomaly requests, and fully funding the FAA in FY2024. The goal is to enhance safety, foster new technology, and expand the economic benefits of American aviation.
