President Donald J. Trump awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor to Captain Gary Michael "Mike" Rose, a retired United States Army Captain, for his gallantry during the Vietnam War. Captain Rose risked his life to administer lifesaving aid to his comrades despite severe injury and enemy fire. The President commended Rose's will to endure and his love for his fellow soldiers. Rose was joined by his family and fellow members of his unit during the ceremony. He currently spends time with his family and volunteers in his community. The citation read aloud during the ceremony detailed Rose's acts of heroism, including repeatedly running into enemy fire to provide medical aid and shielding a wounded American with his own body. Despite being wounded himself, Rose continued to help move wounded personnel and repel an enemy assault. He also rescued members of his unit from a burning helicopter after it crashed. President Trump addressed Rose's grandson and explained that the Congressional Medal of Honor is awarded to America's bravest heroes who sacrifice for the freedom of the country.
