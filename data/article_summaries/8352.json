President Biden addressed the press and discussed the recent news of zero percent inflation in the economy for the month of July. He emphasized that while some prices may have increased, the prices of other things went down by the same amount, resulting in zero inflation. Despite this, he acknowledged that people are still facing economic challenges.

The President highlighted the positive job growth, with 528,000 jobs created last month and an unemployment rate of 3.5 percent. He mentioned that there are signs of inflation beginning to moderate, which he attributed to the bottom-up and middle-out approach to building the economy.

President Biden called for the immediate passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, stating that it is crucial to keep inflation from getting worse. He outlined the benefits of the act, including reducing the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance premiums, and energy costs, as well as making big corporations pay their fair share and reducing the deficit without raising taxes on those making under $400,000 per year.

While acknowledging the progress made, President Biden noted that there is still work to be done to bring inflation down and address global challenges such as the war in Europe, disruptions in supply chains, and pandemic shutdowns in Asia.

The President then shifted the focus to the signing of the PACT Act, which is aimed at helping millions of veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during their military service. He expressed gratitude to veterans, their families, and advocates for their efforts in pushing for this legislation. President Biden highlighted the importance of fulfilling the sacred obligation to care for veterans and their families.

The PACT Act expands access to healthcare and disability benefits for veterans harmed by toxic exposure. It empowers the Department of Veterans Affairs to quickly determine a service member's illness and related military service to determine eligibility. For families of veterans who died from toxic exposure, the act provides a monthly stipend for surviving spouses with two children, as well as access to life insurance, home loan insurance, tuition benefits, and healthcare assistance.

President Biden urged veterans and their families to promptly file claims and access the benefits and care they deserve. He also mentioned other efforts being made to link toxic exposure to diseases and provide comprehensive care for veterans.

In closing, President Biden assured veterans that he will always have their back and fight for their care and benefits. He emphasized the importance of working together as a whole-of-government and whole-of-country approach to address issues such as suicide among service members and veterans. The President then proceeded to sign the PACT Act into law.
