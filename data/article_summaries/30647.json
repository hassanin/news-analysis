President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed March 5 to March 11, 2017, as National Consumer Protection Week in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of consumer confidence in the integrity and security of personal information and the protection of privacy. With the increasing number of online transactions and activities, the safety of consumer information is at risk. The proclamation highlights the need for tools and knowledge to improve online security and protect personal information and privacy. It also acknowledges the impact of cyber crimes, such as identity theft and fraud, on American families and emphasizes the role of well-informed consumers in preventing fraudulent cyber transactions. The Federal Government, along with national organizations and State and local partners, provides consumer education resources to assist vulnerable consumers, including military service members, identity theft victims, and others. The proclamation calls upon government officials, industry leaders, and advocates to educate citizens about the protection of personal information and identity theft through consumer education activities in communities across the country.
