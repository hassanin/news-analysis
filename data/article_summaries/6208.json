Annual inflation has decreased by 45% since last summer, with the rate decreasing for 10 consecutive months. The economy and job market are strong, with the lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. Gas prices have dropped by nearly $1.50 since their peak, and grocery store prices have also decreased in the last two months. The President's Inflation Reduction Act is working to lower the cost of prescription drugs, healthcare, and home energy. Additionally, over $400 billion has been invested in private sector manufacturing, creating good jobs across the country. However, the biggest threat to the economy would be if House Republicans fail to prevent default, which would result in job losses, increased costs, a higher deficit, and damage to retirement accounts. The President is committed to avoiding default and having a separate conversation about the budget without jeopardizing the full faith and credit of the United States.
