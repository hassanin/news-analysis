The Biden-Harris Administration is prioritizing the protection of access to reproductive health care, especially in light of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. They are particularly focused on ensuring access to mifepristone, a medication that was approved by the FDA over twenty years ago for ending early pregnancies and is responsible for more than half of abortions in the US. However, a court in Texas has attempted to override the FDA's approval of medication abortion, which not only affects abortion but also the management of miscarriages. If this decision is upheld, it will jeopardize women's health and undermine the FDA's ability to ensure safe and effective medications for patients. The Administration is fighting this ruling in court and supports the FDA's scientific judgment on the safety and effectiveness of mifepristone. The Justice Department has filed an appeal and sought a stay of the injunction. Various stakeholders, including FDA scholars, medical organizations, and pharmaceutical companies, have expressed their support for maintaining access to this FDA-approved medication. Additionally, the Administration has issued a Presidential Memorandum to counter state officials' attempts to restrict access to mifepristone and discourage pharmacies from dispensing it. The FDA has already taken evidence-based actions to allow mifepristone to be prescribed via telehealth and sent by mail, as well as enabling pharmacies to become certified.
