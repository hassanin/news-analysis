On February 10, 2021, a national emergency was declared by Executive Order 14014 in response to the situation in Burma. This was done to address the threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by the military coup that occurred on February 1, 2021. The coup involved the overthrow of the democratically elected civilian government of Burma, leading to the unjust arrest and detention of government leaders, politicians, human rights defenders, journalists, and religious leaders. This action disregarded the will of the people of Burma, as expressed in the November 2020 elections, and undermined the country's democratic transition and rule of law. In order to address this ongoing threat, the national emergency declared on February 10, 2021, will continue beyond February 10, 2022. This decision is made in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress. This statement was issued by Joseph R. Biden Jr. from The White House on February 7, 2022.
