The President met with national security officials to discuss our preparedness and security measures on the twelfth anniversary of September 11th. Lisa Monaco, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, has been leading meetings to review security measures for this anniversary and other global threats. The President's National Security team is working to prevent 9/11 related attacks and protect U.S. people and facilities abroad. The President emphasized that protecting Americans is the top national security priority. September 11th is a day of remembrance and this year's anniversary is particularly significant due to the loss of four Americans in the Benghazi attacks. The Administration remains committed to bringing the perpetrators to justice and ensuring the safety of personnel serving overseas.
