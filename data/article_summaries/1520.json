President Biden is visiting the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to receive an update on preparations for the 2021 hurricane season. In advance of his visit, the administration announced that it will direct $1 billion for communities, states, and Tribal governments into pre-disaster mitigation resources to prepare for extreme weather events and other disasters. The administration is also announcing the development of next-generation climate data systems at NASA to track how climate change is impacting communities. The United States experienced a record year for extreme weather in 2020, with 22 separate weather and climate-related disasters causing losses exceeding $1 billion each. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting another above-normal hurricane season this year. As climate change threatens to bring more extreme events, the administration is emphasizing the importance of climate resilience and investing in climate research and resources for communities. President Biden has made climate resilience a priority in his investment agenda, including in the American Jobs Plan and the FY22 discretionary request.
