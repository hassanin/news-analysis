President Obama expresses his support for the recommendations made by the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC). He believes that these recommendations are crucial for protecting the long-term viability of the All-Volunteer Force, improving the quality of life for service members and their families, and ensuring the fiscal sustainability of the military compensation and retirement systems.

The President announces his support for 10 out of the 15 recommendations, including survivor benefit plan, financial education, medical personnel readiness, collaboration between the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs, child care, service member education, transition assistance, nutritional financial assistance, dependent space-available travel, and a report on military connected dependents. Some of these recommendations are already being implemented by the Department of Defense, while others will require legislation.

For the remaining recommendations, such as the blended retirement system, reserve component duty statuses, exceptional family member's support, and commissary and exchange consolidation, the President acknowledges their merit but highlights the need for further study to understand their impact on the All-Volunteer Force.

Additionally, President Obama agrees with the Commission's view that the military health care system needs improvement. He mentions that his Fiscal Year 2016 Budget proposes health care reforms that provide more control and choice to service members, retirees, and their families. The President pledges to work with the Commission and Congress to develop additional reform proposals for the military health care system in his Fiscal Year 2017 Budget.
