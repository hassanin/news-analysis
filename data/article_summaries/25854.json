Senate Republicans believe that President Trump is playing a positive role in the tax debate and are optimistic about their chances of passing a significant legislative victory. Trump recently showed his influence by confronting Senator Ron Johnson during a private meeting after Johnson threatened to vote against the tax bill. Trump also addressed concerns about the deficit raised by Senators Bob Corker and James Lankford, warning them about the potential negative effects of a backstop measure. Both Johnson and Corker ultimately voted in favor of the tax bill in the Senate Budget Committee, giving it crucial momentum. Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn praised Trump for inspiring everyone to get the work done, stating that passing the tax bill is a political imperative for Republicans. Trump's personal knowledge and experience with tax policy were also highlighted. Trump is planning to travel to Missouri to pressure Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill to vote for the bill, and has previously visited Indiana to rally support for the tax code changes. Overall, Trump is taking a hands-on approach to lobbying lawmakers and unifying the Senate Republican conference behind his tax plan.
