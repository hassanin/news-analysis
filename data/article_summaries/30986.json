Vice President Mike Pence led a discussion with the chief executives of approximately 50 states, territories, and Washington, DC, along with the White House Coronavirus Task Force to discuss COVID-19 response and recovery efforts. The discussion focused on best practices for reopening states and communities, expanding testing, supporting long-term care residents, and maintaining healthcare capacity. Dr. Deborah Birx discussed testing trends, including declining fatalities. She also requested that governors encourage individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate plasma. Several governors mentioned an increase in positive cases among individuals under the age of 35. Vice President Pence asked for updates on testing and trends, and HHS Admiral Brett Giroir provided an update on community-based testing and testing support. Secretary Azar discussed the shipments of the second round of remdesivir, and CMS Administrator Seema Verma emphasized the need to protect vulnerable seniors, particularly those in nursing homes. Rear Admiral John Polowczyk provided a logistics update on the expansion of domestic production of key resources, restocking the National Stockpile, and delivering PPE to nursing homes. Since January 2020, the Trump Administration has conducted over 310 briefings, including 25 governors' briefings, with over 131,000 participants from state, local, and tribal governments.
