President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation establishing the Gold Butte National Monument in southeast Nevada. The area contains a diverse range of scientific, historic, and prehistoric resources, including important plant and wildlife habitats, geological formations, rare fossils, Native American historical sites, and remnants of mining and ranching activities. The landscape has provided sustenance for humans for thousands of years, and it is home to ancient rock shelters, rock art, and archaeological artifacts. The Gold Butte area also supports a variety of plant and animal species, including the threatened Mojave desert tortoise. The establishment of the monument will protect its cultural, historic, and scientific values and preserve its natural resources for the benefit of all Americans. The proclamation includes provisions for the management and conservation of the monument, as well as access for traditional tribal uses, protection of sacred sites, and the continuation of certain activities such as military overflights and existing infrastructure.
