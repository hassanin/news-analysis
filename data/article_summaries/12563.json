The article discusses the High Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program in Ohio, specifically the Cleveland - Columbus - Dayton - Cincinnati corridor. The Ohio Department of Transportation has been awarded approximately $400 million in funding for this project. The corridor will connect the four major metropolitan areas in Ohio and span 250 miles. It will serve communities near Lake Erie, in Central Ohio, and the Tri-State region around Cincinnati. The project aims to connect economically-distressed counties and create thousands of jobs. It will also bring livability benefits to the region by constructing or restoring stations in historic downtowns. The corridor is expected to be the first phase of a larger vision for an extensive network of passenger rail corridors in Ohio and neighboring states. With funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the service is expected to offer three daily round trips at speeds up to 79 mph, serving a population of over 6.8 million people. The funding will be used for track upgrades, grade crossings, new stations, maintenance facilities, and planning for future service improvements.
