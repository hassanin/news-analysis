President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Vermont following a severe storm, tornado, and flooding that occurred on May 29, 2012. The declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. James N. Russo has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made if requested by the state and further damage assessments warrant it. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA news desk.
