President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed January 2024 as National Human Trafficking Prevention Month in the United States. In an effort to combat human trafficking, the administration has signed an updated National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking, focusing on prevention, prosecution, and protection of survivors. The plan also addresses workers' rights and aims to end forced labor in global supply chains. Efforts are being made to address the root causes of trafficking, bring traffickers to justice, and support survivors in their recovery. The majority of human trafficking victims are women and girls, and recent legislation, such as the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and the American Rescue Plan, aims to provide support and resources for survivors. The proclamation calls on all Americans to learn how to identify signs of trafficking and share the National Human Trafficking hotline as a resource for reporting tips or seeking help. The goal is to ensure that every human being is free to live a life full of dignity and respect.
