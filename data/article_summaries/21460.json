President Barack Obama has proclaimed January 2013 as National Mentoring Month in the United States. In his proclamation, he recognizes the importance of mentors who enrich the lives of young people and strengthen the bonds between generations. The Obama Administration has implemented various programs to support mentorship, such as the Corporate Mentoring Challenge, which encourages businesses to establish or expand mentoring programs. Additionally, the administration has connected young individuals with mentors at the White House and collaborated with organizations in different sectors to create opportunities for low-income and disconnected youth. President Obama encourages all Americans to become mentors and help guide the next generation towards their aspirations. He concludes by calling upon public officials, community leaders, educators, and citizens to observe National Mentoring Month through appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
