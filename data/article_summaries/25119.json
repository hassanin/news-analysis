On July 10, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a series of executive orders focused on improving healthcare, specifically in relation to kidney health. The purpose of these orders is to address the unacceptable state of care for patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The orders aim to prevent kidney failure whenever possible, increase patient choice through affordable alternative treatments, and increase access to kidney transplants. The orders include initiatives to raise awareness about kidney disease, develop payment models to identify and treat at-risk populations earlier, increase the use of home dialysis and kidney transplants, encourage the development of artificial kidneys, improve the utilization of available organs, and support living organ donors. These orders will be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
