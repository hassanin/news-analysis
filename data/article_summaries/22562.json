President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New Hampshire due to a severe winter storm that occurred from February 23 to March 3, 2010. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
