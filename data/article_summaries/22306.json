The U.S. Department of Transportation's Build America Bureau has announced a $2.45 billion loan to Amtrak, marking the largest single loan in the department's history. The loan will be used by Amtrak to purchase 28 new trainsets for the Acela service on the Northeast Corridor, providing an increase in capacity and frequency for travelers between Washington, DC, through New York, NY, and into Boston, MA. Additionally, the loan will fund necessary track upgrades and station improvements at four busy stations in the Northeast Corridor. The goal is to improve safety, passenger experience, and reliability. The loan is seen as an investment in infrastructure and job creation. This loan brings the total amount of loans given through the DOT's RRIF program to approximately $5.1 billion.
