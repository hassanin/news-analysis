President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed September 2020 as National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. The theme for this year's Recovery Month is "Join the Voices for Recovery: Celebrating Connections." Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus, Americans in recovery have shown resilience by creating new ways to connect and support each other. The administration has taken historic action to ensure access to recovery, including expanding telehealth services and ensuring availability of addiction treatment medications. The National Treatment Plan for Substance Use Disorder has been released, outlining steps to improve the quality of treatment and increase access to support services. The president recognizes the importance of healthcare professionals, counselors, peer recovery coaches, faith leaders, first responders, family members, friends, and advocates in helping individuals achieve and sustain recovery. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
