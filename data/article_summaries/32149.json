The Census Bureau has released its official measures of the economic well-being of Americans in 2018. The data shows improvements across the board, particularly for those who have historically been disadvantaged. Real median household income reached its highest level in nearly two decades, at over $63,000. The number of full-time, year-round workers increased, with 2.3 million more in 2018 compared to the previous year. Since 2016, 4.7 million more full-time, year-round workers have been added to the workforce, with higher earnings as well. The poverty rate fell to its lowest level since 2001, with a decline of 0.5 percentage points to 11.8 percent in 2018. This corresponds with a decrease in food insecurity and a decrease in the number of people on food stamps. Disadvantaged groups, such as black and Hispanic Americans, experienced the largest poverty reductions. Incomes rose and inequality fell, with the top 20 percent seeing a decrease in their share of income. The Trump Administration's policies, such as tax reform and deregulation, have been credited with unleashing the private sector and benefiting lower-income families.
