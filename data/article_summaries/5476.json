President Biden has issued an Executive Order aimed at ensuring that the United States takes the lead in harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) while managing the associated risks. The order establishes new standards for AI safety and security, protects privacy, advances equity and civil rights, supports consumers and workers, promotes innovation and competition, and advances American leadership globally. The order calls for bipartisan data privacy legislation, combatting algorithmic discrimination, protecting consumers, supporting workers, promoting innovation, advancing American leadership abroad, and ensuring responsible government use of AI. The administration will also work with international allies and partners on AI governance frameworks. These actions are part of the administration's broader strategy for responsible innovation.
