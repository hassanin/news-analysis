The White House released state-by-state employment data on the impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan. The plan aims to create 3-4 million jobs over the next two years and stimulate the economy. The estimates provided in the data are derived from an analysis conducted by Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, and they outline the estimated effect on employment in each state. The estimates are subject to change based on the final composition of the legislation.
