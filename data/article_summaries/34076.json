On November 22, 2015, President Trump declared a national emergency due to the situation in Burundi, which posed a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The situation in Burundi, marked by violence against civilians, unrest, incitement of imminent violence, political repression, and threats to peace and stability, continues to pose a threat. Therefore, President Trump has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This decision was announced on November 16, 2018.
