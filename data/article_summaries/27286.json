This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on February 9, 2017, aims to address the threat posed by transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations in the United States. These organizations, including drug cartels, engage in widespread illegal activities, such as violence, drug trafficking, smuggling of humans, corruption, cybercrime, and financial crimes. The order outlines various policies to strengthen the enforcement of federal law against these organizations, enhance cooperation with foreign counterparts, maximize information sharing and coordination among federal agencies, and prevent their operational success. The order also establishes an interagency Threat Mitigation Working Group to coordinate efforts against these criminal organizations and directs the submission of quarterly reports on convictions and progress in combating them. The order clarifies that it does not affect existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits.
