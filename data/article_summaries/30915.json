President Donald Trump has requested that Congress consider fiscal year (FY) 2019 budget amendments for various departments, including Agriculture, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, and more. These amendments aim to accurately reflect the policies assumed in Trump's FY 2019 budget. They include correction amendments that would not impact the overall budget authority totals, as well as appropriations language to reflect the "Addendum to the President's FY 2019 Budget to Account for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018." These amendments would increase the total net discretionary budget authority by $95 billion, with $20 billion more allocated to defense and $75 billion more allocated to non-defense. The defense funding would reach the cap specified in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, while non-defense funding would be $57 billion below the non-defense cap. The details of this proposal can be found in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
