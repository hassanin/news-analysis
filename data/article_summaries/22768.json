Vice President Joe Biden wrote an op-ed calling for action to stop campus sexual assault. He discussed the success of the Violence Against Women Act, but emphasized that even one attack is too many. Biden started the It's On Us campaign to raise awareness about sexual violence on college campuses and to get men involved in prevention efforts. The campaign has received support from celebrities, companies, and sports leagues. Over 250,000 students have taken the It's On Us pledge, committing to intervene, recognize consent, and create an environment where sexual assault is unacceptable. Many campuses have hosted events and created public service announcements as part of the campaign. Biden is calling for a Week of Action to further engage students and raise awareness. He suggests organizing drives to get more students to take the pledge, asking businesses to display the It's On Us logo, and involving student organizations in the campaign. Biden also encourages colleges to partner with local resources to support victims of sexual assault. He emphasizes the need to change the culture and asks the right questions about consent and intervention. Biden concludes by urging individuals to visit the It's On Us website to learn how they can take action.
