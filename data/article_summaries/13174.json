President Obama met with Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) leadership, including Chairman Ruben Hinojosa, CHC Immigration Task Force Chair Luis Gutierrez, and Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus Xavier Becerra, to discuss their efforts to pass immigration reform legislation through the House of Representatives. The President expressed concern about the pain caused by the separation of families due to the broken immigration system and asked Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to review current practices to see how enforcement can be conducted more humanely within the confines of the law. President Obama thanked the CHC members for their work and expressed his desire to work together to pressure Congressional Republicans to pass bipartisan immigration reform.
