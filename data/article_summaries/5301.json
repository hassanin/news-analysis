During National Building Safety Month, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. emphasizes the importance of strengthening buildings to ensure the safety of all Americans. The recent tragedy of the Surfside condominium collapse highlights the need for resilient and high-quality infrastructure. Climate change and natural hazard incidents pose significant challenges, disproportionately affecting communities of color and low-income communities. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law aims to address these challenges by repairing aging infrastructure, modernizing buildings, and advancing climate resiliency. Investing in infrastructure also creates opportunities and quality jobs, particularly in disadvantaged communities. The theme of this year's National Building Safety Month is "Safety for All: Codes in Action," emphasizing the adoption and enforcement of modern building codes. By investing in infrastructure, modernizing buildings, and adopting building codes, the impact on climate change can be reduced, more Americans can be protected, and buildings can better withstand natural hazards in the future. President Biden calls on citizens, government agencies, businesses, nonprofits, and other groups to raise awareness and contribute to building safety in their communities.
