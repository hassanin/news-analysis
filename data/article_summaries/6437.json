The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) has been in place for 30 years, providing American workers with the right to take time off to care for themselves and their loved ones without losing their jobs. Before the FMLA, parents had no guaranteed time off for newborns or sick children, and workers could lose their health insurance for taking leave to fight an illness. The FMLA guarantees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually to care for a spouse, parent, child, or oneself, while preserving their jobs. The law has brought peace of mind to many Americans, made workplaces fairer and healthier, and helped women remain in the workforce. However, the United States is one of the few countries that does not provide paid leave to workers, which undermines the health and economic security of families and the nation. President Biden has proposed the first national paid family and medical leave program in US history, which would boost productivity, secure wages, and give workers more control over their lives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the administration expanded the Child Tax Credit, provided funding to childcare providers, invested in caregiver support programs, and signed the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. President Biden reaffirms the importance of being there for loved ones and calls for honoring those who advocated for the FMLA and fighting for the rights of workers.
