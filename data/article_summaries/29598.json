President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will host Prime Minister Andrej Babis and Mrs. Monika Babisova of the Czech Republic for their first official visit to the White House on March 7, 2019. During the visit, they will discuss ways to enhance relations between the United States and the Czech Republic, as well as address shared global challenges such as cyber and energy security issues, and mutual trade concerns. The visit coincides with the 30th anniversary of the Czech Republic's "Velvet Revolution," which marked the end of communist rule, and the 20th anniversary of its membership in NATO. The President and First Lady are looking forward to commemorating these important anniversaries with Prime Minister Babis and Mrs. Babisova.
