On September 29, 2014, the President signed three bills into law. The first is H.R. 4323, known as the "Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2014," which authorizes funding for the Department of Justice over the next five fiscal years. The funding includes $151 million for the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, $12.5 million for DNA training and education programs, and $30 million for the Sexual Assault Forensic Exam Grant Program.
