The article discusses the history and significance of the gardens at the White House. The gardens have a long history, dating back to George Washington's time. Various presidents, including Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, James Monroe, and Theodore Roosevelt, made significant improvements to the gardens. The article also mentions the conservatory that used to exist on the grounds, as well as the East Garden and the Rose Garden, which were redesigned during the presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The White House Kitchen Garden, started by First Lady Michelle Obama, produces food for the White House and donates any excess to local charities. The gardens are open for tours twice a year, allowing visitors to walk the same grounds that every American president since John Adams has walked.
