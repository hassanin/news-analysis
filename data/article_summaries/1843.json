The Vice President of the United States has announced that since the launch of GetInternet.gov in May, the administration has signed up 1 million new households to save on internet service. The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, provides $65 billion to ensure that every American has access to reliable and affordable high-speed internet. The ACP offers eligible households up to $30/month off internet bills, as well as a one-time $100 discount off a connected device. In addition, internet service providers across the country have committed to offering high-speed plans fully covered by the ACP. The Vice President has called on the nation's governors to boost enrollment in their states by taking key steps, and the State of North Carolina has committed to email 5 million households to inform them about the program. The ACP is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's Internet for All Initiative, which aims to provide internet access to every American.
