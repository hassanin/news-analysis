The President has approved the National Strategy for Counterterrorism, emphasizing the commitment to protecting the United States and its interests from terrorism. The strategy aims to enhance national security and guide efforts to defeat terrorists and terrorist organizations. The United States, under the President's leadership, has accelerated efforts to defeat terrorists, including the decimation of ISIS in Syria and Iraq. The President also ended US participation in the Iran deal, which had funded Iran's malign activities. The strategy provides guidance to counter the evolving terrorist threats and is the first fully articulated counterterrorism strategy since 2011. It aims to protect the US against all terrorist threats and foster the ability to anticipate, prevent, and respond to new threats using all instruments of American power.
