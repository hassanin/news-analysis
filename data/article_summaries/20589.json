The article discusses the implementation of a new policy under the Affordable Care Act that ensures most health insurance plans will cover women's preventive services, including contraception, without charging a co-pay or deductible. The policy aims to save money for Americans and ensure they receive high-quality care. The new policy accommodates religious liberty while also protecting the health of women. It guarantees that women will have free preventive care that includes contraceptive services, regardless of where they work. If a woman works for a religious employer with objections to providing contraceptive services, the employer will not be required to provide or pay for contraception coverage, but the woman's insurance company will be required to offer her contraceptive care free of charge. The article also mentions that nearly 99% of all women have used contraception at some point in their lives, but many struggle to afford it. The policy addresses concerns raised by religious groups and exempts churches and similar organizations from covering contraception based on their religious objections. It establishes a one-year transition period for religious organizations, during which a new regulation will be proposed and finalized to address the religious objections of non-exempted non-profit religious organizations. The regulation will require insurance companies to cover contraception if the religious organization chooses not to. The new policy does not affect existing state requirements concerning contraception coverage. It is noted that covering contraception is cost-neutral and can save money by keeping women healthy and preventing spending on other health services.
