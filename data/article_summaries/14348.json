The White House has released a Presidential Memorandum regarding the annual refugee admissions numbers for Fiscal Year 2013. The memorandum states that up to 70,000 refugees will be admitted to the United States during this period, based on humanitarian concerns or national interest. This number includes individuals admitted under the Amerasian immigrant admissions program. The memorandum also provides regional allocations for the 70,000 admissions: 12,000 for Africa, 17,000 for East Asia, 2,000 for Europe and Central Asia, 5,000 for Latin America/Caribbean, 31,000 for Near East/South Asia, and a reserve of 3,000 unallocated admissions. The unallocated admissions can be used in regions where additional admissions are needed. The memorandum also designates certain groups of people, such as persons in Cuba, Eurasia and the Baltics, Iraq, and those identified by a US Embassy in any location, as eligible for refugee status within their countries of nationality or habitual residence. The Secretary of State is instructed to report this determination to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
