On September 22, 2019, the President signed into law H.R. 831, also known as the "Reviving America's Scenic Byways Act of 2019." This law mandates that the Secretary of Transportation issues a request for nominations for the National Scenic Byways Program. Within one year of issuing the request, the Secretary must make a list publicly available, identifying the roads that will be designated under the program.
