The White House has announced the launch of the COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium, a public-private partnership that provides COVID-19 researchers worldwide with access to powerful high-performance computing resources. Spearheaded by the White House, the U.S. Department of Energy, and IBM, the consortium includes government, industry, and academic leaders who have volunteered their computing resources to advance scientific research for treatments and a vaccine for COVID-19. Researchers can submit COVID-19 related research proposals to the consortium, which will then be reviewed and matched with computing resources from one of the partner institutions. The computing systems available through the consortium can process large-scale calculations related to bioinformatics, epidemiology, and molecular modeling, helping scientists develop answers to complex scientific questions about COVID-19 in a faster timeframe.
