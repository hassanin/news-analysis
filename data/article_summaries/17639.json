On October 11, 2010, the President signed into law the National Aeronautics Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010, also known as S. 3729. This law authorizes funding for NASA for the fiscal years 2011-2013. It requires the development of a Space Launch System that can access regions of space beyond low-earth orbit. The law also mandates continued support for the development of commercial crew and cargo transportation capabilities. It supports the use of the International Space Station (ISS) through 2020 and requires one additional Space Shuttle mission to the ISS in fiscal year 2011.
