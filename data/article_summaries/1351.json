One hundred years ago, a violent white supremacist mob attacked and destroyed the thriving Black neighborhood of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Approximately 300 Black Americans were killed, and thousands were left homeless. Today, on the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, President Joe Biden calls on the American people to reflect on the history of racial terror and commit to rooting out systemic racism. Greenwood was a prosperous Black community known as Black Wall Street, with successful Black-owned businesses and a commitment to social activism. Despite facing racism and discrimination, Greenwood thrived. However, the community became a target for white supremacists, who tore down the progress that had taken years to build. The destruction was followed by laws and policies that made recovery difficult, such as expensive new construction standards, redlining, and lack of access to loans and credit. The Federal Government must acknowledge its role in stripping wealth and opportunity from Black communities. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to addressing racial inequities through investments in economic security, capital for small businesses in disadvantaged areas, and infrastructure projects that promote equity and access. The pain and fear from the Tulsa Race Massacre still linger today, as testified by survivors like Viola Fletcher. President Biden promises to honor the legacy of Greenwood by working towards racial justice and eradicating systemic racism. He proclaims May 31, 2021, as a Day of Remembrance for the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, calling upon the people of the United States to commemorate the lives lost, celebrate the resilience of survivors, and commit to rebuilding communities destroyed by racism.
