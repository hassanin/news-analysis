Second Lady Karen Pence, accompanied by Secretary of the Air Force Barbara M. Barrett, visited Davis-Monthan and Luke Air Force Bases to address the employment challenges faced by military spouses. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, military spouses had a 24% unemployment rate due to frequent relocations. Mrs. Pence discussed the Trump Administration's efforts to create employment solutions for military spouses and directed them to resources and programs for career opportunities. She also received a briefing on military spouse, family, and mental health programs. In a roundtable discussion in Phoenix, Mrs. Pence praised Arizona's occupational licensing reform legislation and emphasized the importance of finding employment solutions at the local, state, and federal level. She launched an awareness campaign in 2018 to advocate for better career opportunities for military spouses.
