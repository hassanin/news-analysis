The article discusses a proclamation by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the adjustment of imports of aluminum articles into the United States. The Secretary of Commerce had previously found that the importation of aluminum articles threatened to impair national security. The President decided to impose a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. However, discussions with the European Union (EU) led to an exemption for aluminum articles imported from EU member countries until May 1, 2018. The United States and the EU have now reached an agreement to address the national security threat posed by aluminum imports. The agreement includes measures such as trade remedy coordination, monitoring of steel and aluminum trade, and cooperation on addressing excess capacity. The United States will implement a tariff-rate quota on aluminum articles imported from the EU, with specified volumes of eligible imports being excluded from the tariff until December 31, 2023. The agreement aligns with the recommendations in the Secretary's report on the national security impact of aluminum imports. The President has determined that it is not necessary to make adjustments to the tariff level for other countries at this time. The proclamation also amends certain provisions related to the tariff on aluminum articles.
