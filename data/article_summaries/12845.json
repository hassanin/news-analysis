The Obama Administration has announced that it has cut nearly $18 billion in improper payments in 2011. This is part of the Administration's Campaign to Cut Waste, which aims to decrease payment errors in various government programs. The efforts have resulted in a decrease in payment errors in Medicare, Medicaid, Pell Grants, and Food Stamps. The government has avoided making over $20 billion in improper payments since 2010. The goal is to prevent $50 billion in payment errors by the end of 2012. The government has also recaptured over $1.2 billion in overpayments from government contractors. The results have been achieved through increased scrutiny, audits, and the use of technology. Specific programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Pell Grants have seen improvements in reducing payment errors. The government is also implementing new pilot programs to further reduce waste and fraud in Medicare and Medicaid. The Administration is urging Congress to pass proposals that would result in over $160 billion in savings over the next decade. The Department of Health and Human Services will launch four additional pilots to reduce the error rate and cut Medicare and Medicaid waste and fraud. Additionally, agencies are directed to strengthen their oversight of contractors and grant recipients to eliminate unnecessary risk of waste, fraud, and abuse.
