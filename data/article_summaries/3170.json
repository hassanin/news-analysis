The Senate has passed a bill called the CHIPS bill, which aims to lower costs and create jobs in the United States. The bill will accelerate semiconductor manufacturing in America, leading to lower prices on a range of products. It is also expected to create good-paying jobs and strengthen American supply chains. The bill has received bipartisan support, and the President is urging the House to pass it promptly.
