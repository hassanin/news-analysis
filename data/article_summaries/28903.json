President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536 with respect to Somalia will continue beyond April 12, 2020. The United States is committed to Somalia's stabilization and believes that maintaining sanctions against those undermining its stability is important. The situation in Somalia is seen as posing an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
