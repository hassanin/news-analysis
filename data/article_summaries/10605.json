The United States is providing security assistance to Ukraine to help it secure its borders and maintain its territorial integrity. President Obama has approved over $23 million in additional defensive security assistance since March. This includes body armor, night vision goggles, and communications equipment. The US has also provided meals, medical supplies, equipment for the armed forces, and non-lethal tactical gear. Cooperative Threat Reduction funding has been allocated to support Ukraine's State Border Guard Service with supplies and equipment. Senior US defense officials have met with their Ukrainian counterparts to discuss regional security and defense cooperation. In early June, there will be a meeting in Kyiv to set the strategic direction for future military-to-military cooperation.
