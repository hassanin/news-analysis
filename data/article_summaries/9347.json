The Department of Justice is also going after Russian oligarchs who have been enriching themselves at the expense of the Russian people. The President announces that dozens of names, including one of Russia's wealthiest billionaires, will be added to the list and travel to America will be banned for more than 50 Russian oligarchs and their associates. The US will continue to support Ukraine with direct assistance. President Biden also mentions his recent meeting with the quartet in Southeast Asia and emphasizes the importance of keeping the economy growing and making everyday things more accessible and affordable for the American people. He discusses progress made on providing healthcare to veterans suffering from toxic exposure and instructs relevant departments to develop initial guidance for schools to provide mental health support for students, including using Medicaid funds. The President expresses optimism about the ability to unite the country and address critical needs, but also emphasizes the need for swift and courageous action to change the world's dynamic.
