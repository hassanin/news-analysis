President Trump has unveiled an infrastructure plan that aims to make the country's infrastructure safer, faster, and more reliable. The plan focuses on cutting down the permitting process from up to 10 years to 2 years to expedite the building of projects such as skyscrapers, bridges, and highways. The federal government, although it plays a significant role in permitting, actually owns and funds very little infrastructure in the United States. The plan aims to incentivize private companies, state and local governments to take ownership of their infrastructure projects and make decisions that meet their unique needs. The plan will award federal money based on the merits of innovative infrastructure proposals, encouraging outside investment and shortened timelines. The goal is to allow states and communities to have more control over their infrastructure projects and improve the quality of life for their residents.
