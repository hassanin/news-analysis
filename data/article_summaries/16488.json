The United States and 22 other countries have reached an agreement on the first-ever global carbon standards for commercial aircraft. These standards, set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), are expected to reduce carbon emissions by more than 650 million tons between 2020 and 2040. This is equivalent to removing over 140 million cars from the road for a year. The standards will apply to new aircraft designs as well as aircraft types currently in production. They will promote fuel efficiency improvements, leading to carbon pollution reductions. The agreement on carbon emission standards is part of a comprehensive approach by the United States and other ICAO countries to reduce carbon emissions from aviation through technology development, air traffic improvements, alternative fuels, and market mechanisms. This agreement is an important step towards implementing a global market-based approach to reduce aviation emissions later this year. The United States has been a leader in developing these standards for over five years. This announcement follows the Paris Climate Agreement reached in December 2015 and demonstrates the international community's commitment to take action on climate change.
