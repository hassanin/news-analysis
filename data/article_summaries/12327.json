The White House has transmitted a proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO) concerning peaceful uses of nuclear energy to Congress. The proposed agreement, negotiated in accordance with applicable law, aims to promote nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United States. It establishes a framework for peaceful nuclear cooperation with Taiwan, allowing for the transfer of information, material, equipment, and components for nuclear research and power production. The agreement does not permit the transfer of Restricted Data, sensitive nuclear technology and facilities, or major critical components of such facilities. In the event of termination, key nonproliferation conditions and controls will continue to apply. The authorities on Taiwan have demonstrated a reliable record on nonproliferation and commitments to multilateral treaties, despite their inability to formally accede to them due to their political status. The United States regards Taiwan as bound by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction (BWC). The authorities on Taiwan follow International Atomic Energy Agency standards and work closely with U.S. and mainland Chinese civilian nuclear authorities. The proposed agreement has been reviewed by relevant agencies and is considered to promote common defense and security without unreasonable risk. The Obama Administration urges Congress to give it favorable consideration, and consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee will begin.
