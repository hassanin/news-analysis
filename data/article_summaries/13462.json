President Obama issued a memorandum directing executive departments and agencies to dispose of unneeded federal real estate in order to save money, cut operating costs, and improve energy efficiency. The Federal Government has managed more real estate than necessary, resulting in wasted taxpayer dollars and energy resources. The memorandum calls for agencies to accelerate efforts to identify and eliminate excess properties, make better use of remaining assets, and pursue consolidation opportunities. The goal is to achieve $3 billion in cost savings by the end of fiscal year 2012 through increased proceeds from the sale of assets and reduced operating expenses. Additionally, agencies are directed to adopt a policy against expanding data centers and develop plans to consolidate and reduce them within 5 years. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will develop guidance for agencies to carry out these requirements, and the Administrator of General Services will coordinate agency efforts and report on the results. The memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
