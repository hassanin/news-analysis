On World Refugee Day, the President expressed solidarity with refugees around the world and praised the resilience of those who flee violence and persecution, as well as the dedication of those who help them. He highlighted the alarming fact that there are now over 51 million refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons, the highest number since World War II. He emphasized the dire situation in Syria, where 45% of the population has been driven from their homes, with over 2.8 million becoming refugees in neighboring countries. He also mentioned the crises in the Central African Republic, South Sudan, and Iraq, which have forced millions to flee. The President acknowledged that refugee crises reveal both the worst and best in humanity, with acts of hatred and violence contrasting with acts of valor and compassion. He highlighted the United States' role as the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to refugees and the leading nation in admitting refugees for permanent resettlement. He emphasized that the United States' commitment to refugees extends beyond its borders and that refugees contribute to the country's identity and strength.
