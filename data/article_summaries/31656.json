In this op-ed by Kellyanne Conway, Counselor to the President, she discusses the opioid crisis in the United States and the actions taken by the Trump administration to combat it. Conway highlights the alarming statistics of drug overdoses, which claim nearly 200 lives each day and surpass the annual death tolls of breast cancer, car accidents, and gun violence. She mentions that since President Trump issued a nationwide call to action and declared a national public health emergency, progress has been made in tackling the crisis. Seizures of illicit drugs have increased, new prescriptions for opioids have decreased, and overdose deaths attributed to prescription pain medications have started to level off. Conway also mentions the passage of H.R. 6, The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which aims to expand access to evidence-based treatment, protect communities from illicit drugs, and raise public consciousness about the dangers of synthetic opioids like fentanyl. The bill also includes provisions for assisting infants born dependent on opioids and children in foster care due to parental substance abuse. Conway emphasizes the administration's whole-of-government approach and the focus on treating the whole person. She mentions the increase in people receiving evidence-based medication-assisted therapy for opioid addiction, as well as the grants awarded to states by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to address the crisis. Conway also highlights President Trump's support for National Prescription Drug Take-Back Days, where record-breaking amounts of unwanted prescription drugs were collected. She concludes by emphasizing that the opioid crisis affects every area of the country and that the administration is committed to helping those struggling with addiction, regardless of their political affiliations.
