Vice President Joe Biden has announced new steps to improve clinical trials as part of the Cancer Moonshot initiative. These steps aim to increase access to information about clinical trials, incentivize new ways of designing trials, and strengthen the transparency of trial results. Currently, less than five percent of cancer patients enroll in clinical trials due to lack of awareness. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has launched a redesigned website, trials.cancer.gov, which will provide user-friendly information about NCI-supported cancer clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will encourage the use of innovative trial designs to make trials more efficient and decrease costs. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has published a final rule that specifies requirements for clinical trial registration and results reporting in ClinicalTrials.gov. This will enhance transparency and prevent unnecessary duplication of trials. The NIH is also working to increase the usability of ClinicalTrials.gov to make it easier for patients to find relevant trials and information.
