President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288, with respect to Zimbabwe, is to continue beyond March 6, 2014. The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other individuals continue to pose a threat to Zimbabwe's democratic processes and institutions, as well as the foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, Obama has determined that it is necessary to maintain the sanctions in response to this threat.
