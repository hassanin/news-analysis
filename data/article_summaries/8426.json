President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued a memorandum to the Secretary of Defense regarding the waiver of statutory requirements in order to address potential shortfalls in critical Department of Defense supply chains. The memorandum invokes section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 and determines that action is necessary to prevent severe impairment of national defense capability. As a result, the requirements of section 303(a)(1)-(a)(6) of the Act are waived for supply chains outlined in the June 2021 White House report and the February 2022 Department of Defense report. These waivers specifically apply to defense organic industrial base supply chains critical to the Department of Defense, as well as critical supply chains for electronics, kinetic capabilities, castings and forgings, minerals and materials, and power and energy storage. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of a robust, resilient, and sustainable domestic industrial base for national security and the protection of critical infrastructure. The memorandum directs the publication of this decision in the Federal Register.
