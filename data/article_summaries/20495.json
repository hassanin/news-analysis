The Obama Administration honored ten individuals as "White House Champions of Change" for their efforts in preventing prescription drug abuse and heroin use, increasing access to treatment, and supporting those in recovery. The event featured remarks from White House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell, and Director of National Drug Control Policy Michael Botticelli. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy hosted a discussion with Allison Janney, Emily Osment, and Chuck Lorre from the CBS comedy series Mom. 

In addition, nearly 200 nursing schools and over 50 pharmacy schools committed to requiring advanced practice nursing students and all pharmacy students to receive prescriber education and overdose prevention education respectively. These commitments are in line with the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. 

The Federal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force also held its first meeting to advance access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment and promote compliance with parity implementation. 

The Drug Enforcement Administration will hold its 11th National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, providing a safe way to dispose of unneeded prescription drugs, including opioids and other controlled substances. Walgreens is also installing safe medication disposal kiosks in over 500 drugstores across the country. 

The Obama Administration has been working to address the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic through evidence-based prevention programs, prescriber education, prescription drug monitoring, safe drug disposal, medication-assisted treatment, and the use of naloxone, an overdose reversal drug. The President has also called for $1.1 billion in new funding to help every American with an opioid use disorder receive treatment.
