The American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act, signed into law by President Biden a year ago, provides $1.9 trillion in emergency assistance measures. A significant portion of these funds, $122 billion, is allocated to preschool through twelfth-grade schools in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ARP aims to keep schools open safely, address learning loss, and support students' mental health. In addition to the $122 billion, an additional $8 billion is dedicated to meeting the needs of certain student populations, including students with disabilities and children experiencing homelessness. The funds have been used to reopen schools, combat learning loss, and address students' mental health needs. President Biden has called for the hiring of more teachers, encouraged people to become tutors and mentors, and highlighted the importance of addressing child mental health. The ARP ESSER funds support these goals by funding activities such as safely reopening schools, combating learning loss through teacher hiring and tutoring programs, and addressing students' social, emotional, and mental health needs. The funds also aim to strengthen the educator workforce and support their well-being.
