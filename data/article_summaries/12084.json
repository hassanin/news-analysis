The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to help uninsured Americans gain coverage through the Affordable Care Act. The challenge focuses on communities with large numbers of uninsured individuals and aims to engage community leadership to build outreach efforts. At the end of the enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of new Marketplace signups in participating communities to estimates of eligible uninsured people to determine which communities made the most progress. The winning community will receive recognition, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama. Salt Lake City is one of the 20 communities participating in the challenge. In Utah, health insurance coverage is affordable, with a high percentage of people able to find plans for $100 or less. Tax credits are available, with 66% of Marketplace enrollees in Utah receiving a tax credit in 2015. Consumers have a choice of plans, with 4 issuers offering individual health plans in the Marketplace in 2016. Switching to the lowest-cost plan within a coverage level can save consumers money on their premium costs. Progress has been made in reducing the uninsured rate in Utah, but more work is needed. Salt Lake City and the surrounding region have 137,000 uninsured individuals eligible for the Marketplace.
