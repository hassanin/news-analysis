The administration is also working to end veteran homelessness and support women veterans by providing specialized health care and addressing barriers to services for LGBTQ+ veterans. The Department of Education has closed the 90/10 loophole that allowed for-profit colleges to aggressively recruit veterans. Efforts to protect veterans and military families from fraud are underway, and the Department of Labor is working to connect veterans with resources for training and employment. The administration is expanding services for veteran caregivers and helping educators support military-connected students. Initiatives are also in place to support children living with wounded, ill, or injured service members and veterans. The administration is addressing hunger and promoting healthier living among veterans, establishing an Office of Food Security and providing funding for adaptive sports.
