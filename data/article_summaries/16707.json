The United States and Russia signed a military transit agreement on July 6, 2009, allowing the US to transport its military personnel and equipment across Russian territory to support American and Coalition forces in Afghanistan. This agreement complements a NATO-Russia arrangement for shipping non-lethal equipment to Afghanistan through Russian territory. The new transit routes will save the US government up to $133 million annually in transportation costs and allow for 4,500 flights per year. This agreement is free of any air navigation charges and will increase the efficiency of efforts to defeat violent extremism in Afghanistan and ensure regional security. The Russian Federation's decision to open these transit routes demonstrates its support for the security, stability, and reconstruction of Afghanistan.
