President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Vermont and has ordered federal assistance to support state and local recovery efforts after a severe storm and flooding occurred on April 15, 2019. The federal funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Bennington, Essex, Orange, Rutland, Washington, and Windsor are the areas affected by the storm and flooding. In addition, federal funding will be available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and further designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by additional damage assessments.
