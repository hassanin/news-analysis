Despite progress in terms of economic growth, rising wages, and low unemployment, there is still a significant gender pay gap in the United States. On Equal Pay Day, President Biden acknowledges this injustice and emphasizes the need to address the pay disparities faced by women, especially women of color and women with disabilities. Discrimination, caregiving responsibilities, and underrepresentation in high-paying careers contribute to the pay gap. The Biden administration is committed to tackling pay inequity and dismantling barriers for women in the workplace. Efforts include providing stimulus relief, supporting child care providers, creating more jobs, raising the minimum wage for federal contractors, promoting pay equity, strengthening workplace protections, and expanding access to quality child and elder care. The administration also advocates for the passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act to increase transparency and accountability. President Biden highlights the importance of equal pay as a matter of justice, fairness, and national values, and calls upon all Americans to recognize the value and contributions of women in the labor force and join efforts to achieve equal pay.
