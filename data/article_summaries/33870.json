The White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, held a press briefing on October 30, 2017. She addressed the upcoming tax reform bill and discussed the timeline for its passage. Sanders used an anecdote about reporters going out for beer to explain the principles of tax reform. She also answered questions about the recent indictments of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, as well as the plea agreement of George Papadopoulos. Sanders stated that the charges against Manafort and Gates have nothing to do with the President or his campaign, and she emphasized that Papadopoulos had a limited role as a volunteer on the campaign. She also stated that there is no intention to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Sanders declined to comment on the specific details of the Mueller investigation and said that the White House believes the investigation will conclude soon. She also addressed other topics, such as welfare reform and the recent court decision regarding transgender military policy.
