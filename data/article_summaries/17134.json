The White House expressed disappointment that Northern Ireland's political leaders did not reach an agreement during the all-party talks. They commended the work of the independent chair and his team, who have been consulting with civil society and political parties for several months. The draft text produced through the all-party process was seen as progress and a valuable contribution. The White House urges Northern Ireland's political leaders to continue working together, implementing proposals where there is consensus, and addressing issues such as parades, flags, emblems, and the legacy of the past. They believe that engaging in sustained dialogue with civil society can help overcome sectarian divisions. The United States will continue to support the people and institutions of Northern Ireland.
