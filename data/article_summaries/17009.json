The White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, mentioned that earlier in the day, Valerie Jarrett, Gene Sperling, Jeff Zients, and Alan Krueger met with business leaders in the defense contracting industry to discuss the potential impacts of the sequester. The participants noted that allowing the sequester to take effect would have devastating impacts, especially for defense contractors. Carney also mentioned that the participants did not support proposals to address only the defense spending side of the sequester and let the nondefense cuts kick in. Carney also answered questions about the Boy Scouts delaying their decision on allowing gay members and leaders, the President's meeting with Senate Democrats, the assault weapons ban, the President's State of the Union address, drone strikes, the Postal Service ending Saturday delivery, and the President's Cabinet appointments.
