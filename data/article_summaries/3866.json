On May 16, 2012, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Yemen and others that threatened Yemen's peace, security, and stability. This included obstructing the political process and blocking the implementation of a peaceful transition of power. The national emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and was set to expire on May 16, 2022. However, due to the ongoing threat posed by certain former members of the Government of Yemen, President Biden has decided to continue the national emergency for another year. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
