This week is an important one for President Biden's leadership on the world stage, with several key meetings and events planned. Today, the President will meet with the Secretary-General of the United Nations to discuss critical topics such as Afghanistan, Yemen, COVID-19, and climate change. Tomorrow, he will deliver his first address to the U.N. General Assembly, focusing on the idea of closing the chapter on war and opening a chapter of intense diplomacy. The speech will touch on issues like COVID-19, climate change, trade, counterterrorism, and competition with great powers. Later in the week, the President will host the first-ever in-person Quad Summit, which will bring together like-minded democratic partners to tackle challenges such as COVID-19, climate change, economic investment, and technology. He will also hold bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Modi, Prime Minister Suga, Prime Minister Morrison, and Prime Minister Johnson to discuss various issues. Additionally, on Wednesday, the President will host a summit on COVID-19 to rally the world in ending the pandemic and strengthening global systems to handle future outbreaks. The summit will involve setting goals for vaccinations, medications, and technologies, as well as announcing further contributions from the United States. Finally, the President announced new travel protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19, requiring adult foreign nationals traveling to the U.S. to be fully vaccinated starting in November.
