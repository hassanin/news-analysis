The White House has released a statement regarding North Korea's recent missile launch, stating that despite the failure of the launch, it is a provocative action that threatens regional security, violates international law, and goes against North Korea's own commitments. The United States remains vigilant and committed to the security of its allies in the region. The President is open to engaging with North Korea, but insists that the country must adhere to its international obligations, deal peacefully with its neighbors, and live up to its commitments. The statement also highlights that North Korea's pursuit of weapons and propaganda displays are only further isolating itself, while its people suffer from hunger. It emphasizes that true security and strength can only be achieved through abiding by international law, fulfilling obligations, and working towards the well-being and trust of its neighbors.
