The United States has announced a four-fold increase in funding for the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) for Fiscal Year 2017. The increase in funding, totaling $3.4 billion, aims to strengthen the U.S. military presence in Europe and uphold Article 5 commitments to NATO members. The statement emphasizes the need for NATO allies to properly resource their defense and invest in the capabilities required by the Alliance. It also highlights the evolving challenges facing NATO, including those to its east and south, such as civil war, failing states, mass migration, and terrorism. The budget request aims to ensure the United States is prepared to meet its commitments to NATO and defend shared principles of international law and order.
