President Trump visited Fincantieri Marinette Marine in Marinette, Wisconsin, to celebrate the awarding of a contract to build the next generation of guided missile frigates for the United States Navy. The contract, worth up to $5.5 billion, will support 1,500 full-time employees and create an estimated 15,000 additional jobs through the Wisconsin supply chain. The FFG(X) frigates will be some of the fastest, most advanced, and most maneuverable combat ships in the world. President Trump emphasized the importance of rebuilding the United States military and protecting the country's defense industrial base. He praised the workers at Fincantieri Marinette Marine for their dedication and craftsmanship, and reiterated his commitment to "Buy American and hire American."
