In this press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney discusses the President's plan on taxes. Carney explains that the President supports extending tax cuts for 98% of Americans, but not for the wealthiest Americans. He argues that tax cuts for the middle class have a positive impact on the economy, while tax cuts for the wealthy do not. Carney also addresses questions about offshore bank accounts, the fiscal cliff, and the situation in Syria. Overall, the briefing emphasizes the President's position on tax cuts for the middle class and the need for bipartisan cooperation in Congress.
