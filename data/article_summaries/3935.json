The White House announced Operation Fly Formula, an initiative to speed up the import of infant formula and get it to stores faster. Under the operation, the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services are authorized to use Department of Defense contracted commercial aircraft to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards. A military plane will arrive in Indiana with 78,000 pounds of specialty infant formula, enough for over half a million bottles. The formula was manufactured in an FDA-approved facility and will be inspected on arrival. The first shipment prioritizes a formula type that serves a critical medical purpose and is in short supply in the United States. The transportation process from Europe to the U.S. is typically two weeks, but Operation Fly Formula cuts it down to approximately three days. The initiative is part of the administration's efforts to increase the availability of infant formula in the market.
