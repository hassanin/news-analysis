President Biden has announced three new nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys. These individuals were chosen for their commitment to upholding the rule of law, professionalism, experience, dedication to equal justice, and commitment to the independence of the Department of Justice. The President has proposed a budget that would increase funding for law enforcement to address the rising crime rate. He has also launched efforts to tackle gun crime by increasing police presence, supporting prevention programs, and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys is crucial for these initiatives. The President has now announced a total of 60 nominees for U.S. Attorney positions. The nominees are Roger B. Handberg for the Middle District of Florida, Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida, and McLain J. Schneider for the District of North Dakota.
