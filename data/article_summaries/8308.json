Nine East Coast states and four Federal agencies have signed a new agreement to strengthen regional collaboration on offshore wind supply chain development. This agreement, called the New Atlantic Transmission Action Plan, is part of a broader strategy to seize offshore wind opportunities across America. President Biden's Investing in America agenda aims to grow the American offshore wind industry, create thousands of jobs, power millions of homes with clean electricity, and reduce climate pollution. The Biden-Harris Administration is taking new steps to expand the offshore wind supply chain, plan and build transmission infrastructure, and advance innovation in order to reduce deployment barriers and lead in cutting-edge technologies. The administration has already approved four commercial-scale offshore wind projects and is on track to complete reviews of at least 16 more by 2025, representing over 27 gigawatts of clean energy. Investments in the U.S. offshore wind industry have increased by $7.7 billion since President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, and the number of companies supporting the supply chain has risen to 4,100 across all 50 states.
