President Joe Biden has announced the acting agency leadership across the administration to assist in the transition of government. These individuals, who are mostly career civil servants, will temporarily lead federal agencies while Cabinet nominees go through the confirmation process. They have significant experience in the agencies they will lead and will play a vital role in coordinating a whole-of-government approach to address the challenges facing the nation. The goal is to restore trust in the government and ensure that it serves the American people. Vice President Kamala Harris expressed gratitude for their dedication and expertise in helping rebuild the economy, confront the pandemic, and protect the nation's interests abroad. The list includes acting leaders for various departments such as the Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Education, Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, and more. These individuals will serve in acting capacities until permanent leadership can be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
