The United States does not recognize Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro's claim to power. The "election" in May 2018 was considered internationally as not free, fair, or credible. The Trump Administration supports the Venezuelan National Assembly, the only legitimate branch of government elected by the Venezuelan people. They also support the decision of National Assembly President Juan Guaido to declare that Maduro does not legitimately hold the country's presidency. The illegitimate Maduro regime is held responsible for the safety of Venezuelans who are demanding to freely choose their leaders. The United States will use its economic and diplomatic power to push for the restoration of Venezuelan democracy.
