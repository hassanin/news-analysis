They both expressed their concerns about the ongoing violence and emphasized the urgency to resolve the crisis. President Obama reiterated his belief that former President Gbagbo should respect the will of the Ivorian people and relinquish his claim to the presidency. President Obama also thanked President Bongo Ondimba for his leadership and the important role that Gabon plays as a member of the United Nations Security Council.
