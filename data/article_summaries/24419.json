The article is a press briefing by Mike Froman and Gayle Smith, previewing President Obama's speech at the Millennium Development Goals Summit. The President will be discussing the administration's new development policy, which focuses on economic growth, selectivity in aid allocation, coordination with other donors, innovation, and sustainability. The policy also emphasizes the role of development in national security and the importance of building capable partners. The briefing addresses questions about specific aspects of the policy, such as the role of internet access and broadband in economic development, the potential reallocation of aid, and the support for a financial transaction tax. It also addresses concerns about meeting development commitments and the potential pushback from people in the US who question sending aid overseas during an economic crisis. The briefing concludes by mentioning that the policy incorporates lessons from the Millennium Challenge Corporation and includes the establishment of a standing interagency development policy committee.
