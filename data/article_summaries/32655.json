On June 25, 2019, the President signed two laws. The first is the "Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019," which requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to include Blue Water Navy veterans under the presumption of service connection for certain Agent Orange connected medical conditions. It also makes changes to VA's home loan programs. The second law is the "Northern Mariana Islands Long-Term Legal Residents Relief Act," which allows certain aliens who had previously been allowed to remain in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) under temporary parole status to be admitted as legal residents.
