The United States has designated the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization for the past twenty years. Hezbollah has been responsible for numerous acts of terrorism, including bombings of U.S. embassies and barracks in Lebanon. The group has also been involved in attempted attacks in various countries around the world. Despite its political cover, Hezbollah's terrorist wing and political wing are one and the same. The United States will continue to recognize the entire group as a terrorist organization and will target its infrastructure and financial support networks. The international community needs to take more action to isolate Hezbollah and its sponsor, Iran. The Trump Administration calls on all nations to stand against Iran and Hezbollah and to recognize that Hezbollah is not a legitimate political party.
