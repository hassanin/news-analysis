The US Department of Labor has awarded $7.5 million to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) for a project aimed at improving geographic mobility for workers in licensed occupations. The project, which involves a coalition of 10 states, will focus on two main goals: identifying licensing criteria to ensure they are not overly burdensome, and improving portability for selected occupational licenses across state lines. The NCSL will also produce research and technical assistance materials for all states to address similar issues. The project will involve collaboration with the National Governor's Association's Center for Best Practices and the Council of State Governments. The partners will conduct five research projects, including a policy literature scan, a research effort to collect information on licensure requirements, and an analysis of barriers to entering the labor market for impacted populations.
