This article is a presidential memorandum from January 10, 2012, issued by President Barack Obama. It concerns the certification of U.S. participation in the United Nations Mission in South Sudan. The memorandum states that members of the U.S. Armed Forces participating in this mission are not at risk of criminal prosecution or jurisdiction by the International Criminal Court (ICC). This is because the Republic of South Sudan is not a party to the ICC and has not invoked its jurisdiction under the Rome Statute. The memorandum authorizes the Secretary of State to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
