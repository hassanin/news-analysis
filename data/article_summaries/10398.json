President Obama commends the House and Senate for passing legislation to end the application of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to Russia and Moldova, which will allow him to extend Permanent Normal Trade Relations to both countries. This legislation will benefit American businesses and workers by allowing them to take advantage of WTO rules and market access commitments. It also creates job opportunities and levels the playing field for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and service providers. The President's administration will continue to work with Congress and international partners to support a free and democratic future for Russia and promote the rule of law and human rights globally.
