The article is a background briefing by a senior U.S. official on a P5+1 meeting with Iran. The official recaps the events of the day, which included a plenary session, informal lunch, and discussions. Four main themes emerged from the discussions: the unity of the P5+1 group, focus on the nuclear issue, the urgency of the diplomatic process, and the need for Iran to take practical steps. The official emphasized the importance of Iran addressing the international community's concerns by creating confidence in its nuclear intentions and establishing transparency in its program. The official also discussed the Tehran research reactor and a proposal to use Iran's own low-enriched uranium (LEU) stockpile as the basis for the reactor fuel. The Iranians agreed to accept this proposal in principle, and a meeting is scheduled in Vienna to work out the details. The official concluded by stating that today's engagement with Iran on its nuclear program was a significant step, but the process ahead will be difficult and intensive.
