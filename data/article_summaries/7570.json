The United States is calling for the immediate repeal of Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA) and for the Ugandan government to respect the universal human rights of all people in Uganda. The enforcement of the AHA is seen as a violation of human rights and part of a trend of democratic erosion in Uganda. There have been reports of evictions, attacks, and harassment of individuals who are LGBTQI+. The United States is committed to helping the Ugandan people and has undertaken a review of its engagement with the Ugandan government in light of the AHA. Actions taken so far include raising awareness of the threats posed by democratic backsliding, promoting accountability for human rights abuses, and curtailing direct assistance to the government. The United States remains committed to providing assistance that supports the Ugandan people and communities without discrimination. They will closely monitor the human rights situation in Uganda and take additional steps to promote respect for human rights and accountability.
