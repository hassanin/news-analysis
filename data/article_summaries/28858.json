The article discusses the issue of illegal immigration and sanctuary cities in the United States. It highlights the surge in illegal immigration at the Southwest border and the arrival of a caravan of migrants from Central America. The author argues that the lack of an orderly and fair process to manage the flow of illegal immigrants and asylum-seekers creates a humanitarian and national security crisis. The article also explains how sanctuary cities refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, putting the safety of American citizens and law enforcement at risk. The Department of Justice has filed legal action against three California laws that obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration law. The article concludes by calling for Congress to pass immigration reform to address these challenges.
