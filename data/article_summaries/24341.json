The White House has issued a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran will continue. This national emergency was declared on November 14, 1979, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat posed by the situation in Iran to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the process of implementing the agreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is still ongoing. As a result, the national emergency declared in 1979 will remain in effect beyond November 14, 2016. This continuation is in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
