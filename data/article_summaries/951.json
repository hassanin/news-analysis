President Biden has announced a new effort to make masks more easily accessible to communities heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan involves delivering over 25 million masks to Community Health Centers, food pantries, and soup kitchens across the country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends mask-wearing as a crucial measure to slow the spread of the virus, but many low-income Americans still lack access to masks. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) will collaborate to deliver the masks to Community Health Centers, while the DoD and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) will distribute masks to food banks and other food distribution points. These masks will be no cost, high-quality, washable, and made in America. The initiative is expected to reach an estimated 12 to 15 million Americans and distribute over 25 million masks in total.
