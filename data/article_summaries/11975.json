In this press briefing, Press Secretary Jay Carney makes several announcements, including the President's scheduled call with the Prime Minister of New Zealand to discuss assistance in the aftermath of an earthquake, and economic announcements regarding the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. Carney also addresses questions about the President's position on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and the recent decision to no longer defend its constitutionality. He explains that the President has long opposed DOMA as unnecessary and unfair, and the decision to not defend it was due to a court-imposed deadline and the lack of precedent to defend it. Carney emphasizes that this decision does not reflect the President's personal view on same-sex marriage. The briefing also covers the President's response to the unrest in Libya and the administration's commitment to supporting the rights of the Libyan people and working with international partners to stop the violence. Other topics addressed include the President's policy on the Middle East and North African countries, the possibility of a government shutdown, and the Gulf Coast Claims Facility's handling of oil spill claims.
