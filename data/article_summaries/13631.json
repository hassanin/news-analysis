The article discusses the G-20 Summit in Toronto and its focus on promoting sustainable development through the multilateral development banks. The multilateral development banks have provided $222 billion in financing to the world's poorest following the financial crisis. The G-20 countries have worked on recapitalizing and reforming these institutions to effectively tackle development challenges. The article also highlights the global food security initiative launched by President Obama, called "Feed the Future," which invests in agricultural and market development. The G-20 countries are also working on a global SME Finance Challenge, aimed at promoting financial inclusion for small- and medium-sized entrepreneurs. The article emphasizes the importance of access to finance for SMEs in driving economic development. The Challenge seeks to find the best models for public-private partnerships that can catalyze finance for SMEs. Proposals are being accepted from private financial institutions, investors, foundations, and civil society organizations. The winners will be invited to the G-20 Summit in Seoul, and funding for the winning proposals will be mobilized from multilateral development banks and interested bilateral donors. The Challenge is a unique partnership between the G-20 countries and the Rockefeller Foundation and Ashoka/Changemakers team.
