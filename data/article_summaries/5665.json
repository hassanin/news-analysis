The President and First Lady have announced plans for the 2022 Fall Garden Tours at the White House. The tours will take place on Saturday, October 8, and Sunday, October 9, from 10:00 AM ET to 4:30 PM ET. The tours are free and open to the public, but tickets are required for all attendees, including small children. The National Park Service will distribute free, timed tickets outside the White House Visitor Center starting at 8:30 AM ET on both days. Tickets will be given out on a first-come, first-served basis. The entry point for all guests will be located near the intersection of 15th Street NW and E Street NW, and there will be an ADA entrance at 15th Street NW and Alexander Hamilton Place NW. The White House will closely monitor the COVID-19 situation and may adjust tour availability based on health guidance. Those who have tested positive for COVID-19, have had symptoms, or have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 within 10 days prior to their visit will not be allowed to attend. Face masks will be available for those who choose to wear them.
