This article is an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2015. The order terminates the national emergency declared in a previous executive order (13617) regarding the risk of nuclear proliferation caused by the accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in the Russian Federation. The termination is based on the successful implementation of an agreement between the United States and Russia concerning the disposition of highly enriched uranium extracted from nuclear weapons. The executive order states that the termination does not affect any ongoing actions or proceedings, any actions based on previous acts, or any rights or penalties incurred prior to the termination. The order also clarifies that it does not create any rights or benefits that can be legally enforced against the United States or any other party.
