President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Mississippi and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from April 22 to April 23, 2020. The declaration makes federal funding available to State and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Amite, Claiborne, Covington, George, Jefferson Davis, Jones, Lawrence, Pike, Simpson, Smith, and Wayne are eligible for this assistance. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Jose M. Girot has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Further designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk at (202) 646-3272 or FEMA-NEWS-DESK@FEMA.DHS.GOV.
