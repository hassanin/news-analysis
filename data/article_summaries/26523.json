Ivanka Trump discusses the Trump administration's focus on infrastructure and workforce development initiatives. She highlights the commitment to rebuilding the country, particularly rural areas, waterways, and air traffic control. This week, the focus is on workforce development and addressing the skills gap. Ivanka Trump emphasizes the importance of skilled-based education and apprenticeships as viable alternatives to traditional four-year college degrees. She mentions that there are currently 6 million available American jobs, but companies struggle to find workers with the necessary skill sets. The administration aims to bridge this gap and bring experienced-based education to the forefront. Ivanka Trump also notes that the lack of skilled workers disproportionately affects women and minorities, particularly in STEM-related fields. The administration plans to encourage K-12 education and retraining for displaced workers. Additionally, Ivanka Trump mentions the issue of part-time workers who work multiple jobs and have limited access to benefits. The administration aims to address this problem as well.
