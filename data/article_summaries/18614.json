On January 2, 2013, the President signed into law H.R. 8, the "American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012." This law makes the temporary tax rates on taxable income at or below $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for married couples filing jointly permanent. It also permanently indexes the Alternative Minimum Tax exemption amount to the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, the law extends emergency unemployment compensation benefits and Federal funding for extended benefits for unemployed workers for one year. It continues current Medicare payment rates for physicians' services until December 31, 2013. The law also extends farm bill policies and programs until September 30, 2013 and provides a two-month postponement of the Budget Control Act's sequester.
