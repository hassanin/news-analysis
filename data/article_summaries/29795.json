Second Lady Karen Pence visited Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health in Indianapolis, where she participated in the ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new art therapy studio. The studio will provide a dedicated therapy space for patients, allowing them to leave their rooms for sessions, increasing confidentiality and providing a safe space for emotional expression. Mrs. Pence is the Honorary Chair of the Art Therapy Initiative at Riley Hospital for Children and promotes art therapy as a means of healing. Art therapy is an integrative mental health profession that uses art-making and the creative process to enrich the lives of individuals, families, and communities.
