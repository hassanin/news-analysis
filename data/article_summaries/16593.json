The White House has announced changes to its hostage policy, clarifying that there will be no concessions made to hostage-takers, but that the government will communicate with families of hostages. The government will not facilitate the payment of ransoms, but will work with families to advise them. Lisa Monaco, the Presidentâ€™s top counterterrorism advisor, explained that the policy review was necessary because the hostage-taking environment has changed and is now more complex. The President also met with former hostages and families of current and former hostages to discuss the changes.
