In this article, President Obama provides an update on the situation in the Gulf of Mexico regarding the BP oil spill. He mentions that a new, larger cover has been installed on the oil well to gain greater control over the oil flow while they work on additional auxiliary wells to stop the leak. The scientists and external experts are analyzing the data from the well integrity test to determine if they can safely close the well using the new cover without causing further problems such as new oil leaks. Even if they are unable to close the well, the new cover and additional equipment will be able to contain up to 80,000 barrels of oil per day, significantly more than the previous collection rate of 25,000 barrels per day. President Obama emphasizes the need to take prudent action and not rush into a short-term solution that may create more problems in the future. He assures the American people that all decisions will be based on scientific knowledge and what is best for the people of the Gulf. During the press conference, President Obama also addresses questions about the earthquake and the progress of the auxiliary wells, as well as the payment of fines by BP and his plans to visit the Gulf region. He emphasizes that although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of cleanup, compensation, and ensuring a permanent solution to the oil spill.
