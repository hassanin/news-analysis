The White House Monkeypox Response Coordinator, Bob Fenton, provided an update on the ongoing efforts to scale up vaccine supply and distribution for monkeypox. The focus is on reaching the at-risk population, including gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. The US has made more JYNNEOS vaccine available than any other country in the world. As of Monday, 1.1 million vials of vaccine have been made available to jurisdictions, and 75% of jurisdictions are already administering the vaccine intradermally. The goal is to offer two doses of vaccine to the entire high-risk population. The CDC Director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, provided data on vaccine administration, showing that over 207,000 doses have been administered, with the majority being first doses. She emphasized the importance of receiving the second dose for optimal protection. The data also showed disparities in vaccine administration, with the majority of first doses administered to adults aged 25-39 and males. Dr. Walensky highlighted the need for equity in vaccine distribution and ongoing efforts to address health disparities. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis discussed the partnership with the LGBTQ+ community and the efforts to provide evidence-based behavioral advice to reduce the risk of monkeypox transmission. He emphasized the community's resilience and commitment to protecting itself and highlighted the importance of clear and community-responsive advice. Overall, the update highlighted the progress in vaccine distribution and administration, but also acknowledged the need to continue efforts to reach the at-risk population and address disparities.
