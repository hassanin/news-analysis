The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to helping small businesses survive and recover from the pandemic. Over 400,000 small businesses have permanently closed, and many more are struggling. The administration has distributed over $180 billion in Paycheck Protection Program funding to almost 3 million small businesses. They have been working to distribute funds more equitably, with a focus on the smallest businesses and those in underserved areas. They have also provided more relief to sole proprietors, resulting in more loan approvals for women and minorities. The administration supports extending the Paycheck Protection Program and wants to ensure that every small business has the resources it needs to rehire workers, purchase safety equipment, and pursue opportunities for growth. They are eager to work with Congress to achieve this.
