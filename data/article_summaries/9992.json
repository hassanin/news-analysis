The Senate has passed the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 with bipartisan support. This bill aims to prevent a massive tax hike for middle-class families at the end of the year and provide unemployment insurance for those who are out of work. It also includes additional tax relief for families and incentives for businesses to grow and hire. While not every member of Congress agrees with every provision in the bill, the President believes it will stimulate the economy, create jobs, and help middle-class families. The bill now moves to the House of Representatives, where the President hopes both parties can work together to pass this essential economic package.
