In a speech at the UPS Hapeville Airport Hub in Atlanta, Georgia, President Trump announced a historic breakthrough in infrastructure approval processes. He stated that the current bureaucratic red tape and lengthy approval timelines have been a major obstacle to building a modern transportation system. The new reforms aim to streamline the process, reducing the federal permitting timeline from up to 20 years to two years or less, and eventually aiming for a one-year timeline. The goal is to provide a clear "yes" or "no" answer to projects and eliminate unnecessary delays caused by bureaucratic reviews. The President emphasized that these reforms will not compromise America's environmental standards and will ensure that the nation's infrastructure is the envy of the world. He also highlighted the need to improve broadband networks for farmers and announced plans for infrastructure projects in Georgia.
