The article discusses the importance of affordable and quality healthcare for every American. It highlights that the lowest percentage of Americans are uninsured today, with only eight percent lacking coverage. This progress is attributed to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which has enrolled more than 35 million Americans in ACA-related coverage, including over 21 million people in the Medicaid expansion. The article also mentions that 5 million more people have gained health insurance coverage since the beginning of the current administration, thanks in part to improvements in the ACA through the American Rescue Plan. The author emphasizes the need to protect and build on the ACA, suggesting that the Inflation Reduction Act can help achieve this by saving an average of $800 per year in health insurance premiums for 13 million Americans and preventing 3 million people from becoming uninsured. The article concludes by urging Congress to pass this legislation swiftly to lower healthcare costs and improve access to health insurance for families across the country.
