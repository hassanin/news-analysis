He emphasizes the importance of the upcoming election, stating that it will shape the future of the country. President Biden contrasts the Democratic approach of building a better America for everyone with the Republican approach of "Mega MAGA trickle-down economics" that benefits the wealthy. He highlights the progress made in the economy, job creation, and the fight against COVID-19, but acknowledges that inflation is still a challenge. President Biden mentions the historic legislation passed by Democrats to lower the cost of prescription drugs, healthcare premiums, and energy costs. He criticizes the Republican plan, which includes repealing the achievements of Democrats, such as the power given to Medicare to lower drug prices and the Affordable Care Act. President Biden also addresses the issue of the federal deficit, pointing out that it decreased under his administration and criticizing the Trump tax cuts for benefiting the wealthy and big corporations. He warns that the Republican plan would add trillions of dollars to the deficit and threatens Social Security and Medicare. President Biden urges people to vote and support the Democratic candidates, emphasizing the importance of personal freedoms, the economy, and democracy.
