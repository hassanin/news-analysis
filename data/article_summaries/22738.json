This article is a press briefing given by Jay Carney, the Press Secretary for the White House, on May 16, 2012. In the briefing, Carney discusses President Obama's meeting with congressional leaders and their discussions on measures to create jobs and strengthen the economy. He also mentions the President's "To-Do" list for Congress, which includes tax cuts for small businesses, help for veterans finding jobs, and assistance for responsible homeowners. Carney emphasizes the need for Congress to avoid political fights and act on important issues such as preventing interest rates on student loans from doubling. He also highlights the President's willingness to work with Republicans and Democrats on a balanced approach to tackling the deficit, but states that he will not accept an approach that burdens the middle class and senior citizens without asking for more from millionaires and billionaires.
