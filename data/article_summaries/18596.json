The President and First Lady will host a concert in the East Room of the White House to honor singer-songwriter Carole King, who will be awarded the 2013 Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. The concert will include performances by Carole King, Gloria Estefan, Billy Joel, Jesse McCartney, Emeli Sand√©, James Taylor, and Trisha Yearwood. The President will present the award, as he has done in the past for previous recipients. The event will be streamed live on the White House website and broadcast on PBS stations nationwide. This will be the first time the Gershwin Prize has been awarded to a woman. The concert is part of the "In Performance at the White House" series, which has previously honored musicians like Stevie Wonder, Sir Paul McCartney, and Burt Bacharach and Hal David.
