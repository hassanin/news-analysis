The White House announced that a H1N1 Flu Preparedness Summit will be held on July 9, 2009, with the goal of preparing the nation for a potential severe outbreak of H1N1 flu. The summit will involve Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, and Homeland Security Advisor John Brennan. The H1N1 flu virus is still circulating in the US and other countries, and experts predict that its impact may worsen in the fall. The summit aims to launch a national influenza campaign by bringing together federal, state, and local officials, emergency managers, educators, and public health experts to discuss preparedness priorities and share best practices. The media interested in attending the summit should contact the NIH Press Office for logistics information and pre-registration.
