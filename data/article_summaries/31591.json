In this proclamation, President Donald Trump recognizes National African American History Month and highlights the contributions made by African Americans throughout American history. The theme of this year's observance is "African Americans and the Vote," in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the 15th Amendment, which granted African American men the right to vote. The proclamation also acknowledges the accomplishments of Hiram Revels, the first African American to serve in Congress, and emphasizes the administration's efforts to expand opportunities for African Americans, such as lowering poverty and unemployment rates, designating Opportunity Zones, and passing legislation like the First Step Act and the FUTURE Act. The proclamation concludes by calling on public officials, educators, and all Americans to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities, and reaffirms the commitment to stand against bigotry, intolerance, and hatred.
