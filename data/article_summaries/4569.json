In a bipartisan move, the House and Senate voted to keep the government open, preventing a potential crisis. The bill ensures that active-duty troops will be paid, airport delays will be avoided, and nutrition assistance for women and children will continue. However, it is noted that this situation should not have occurred in the first place. A budget agreement had been reached a few months ago to avoid such a crisis, but some extreme House Republicans attempted to demand drastic cuts, which ultimately failed. It is also highlighted that there is no new funding in this agreement for support to Ukraine, and it is emphasized that American support for Ukraine should not be interrupted. The expectation is that Speaker McCarthy will fulfill his commitment to Ukraine and secure the necessary support.
