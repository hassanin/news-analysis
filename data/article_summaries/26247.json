President Trump has announced plans to dramatically reduce the size of two national monuments in Utah, ending what some see as excessive federal control and giving more power to local residents. The federal government had previously seized control of over 3.2 million acres of land in southeastern Utah to create the Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears national monuments, without much input from residents or their elected representatives. After a review of 27 such monuments, Trump has decided to shrink Bears Ears by 85% and Grand Staircase-Escalante by nearly 46%. However, the majority of the newly undesignated acres will still be subject to federal and state protections. The Trump Administration has also increased Native American representation on the advisory Bears Ears Commission. The move is seen by some as a welcome change that ends federal overreach and restores power to local people.
