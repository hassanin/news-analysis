President Biden has directed his team to ensure that there is enough safe infant formula available during the shortage caused by Abbott Nutrition's recall. The FDA and Abbott have agreed to reopen Abbott's facility in Michigan, which was closed due to bacterial contamination. The FDA has also provided guidance for major formula manufacturers to import formula that is not currently produced for the US market. The Administration is urging states to implement WIC flexibility and is working with manufacturers and retailers to increase the transportation and availability of FDA approved formula. These actions demonstrate the Administration's commitment to addressing the formula shortage quickly and safely.
