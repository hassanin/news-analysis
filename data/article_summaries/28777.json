The article is a transcript of remarks made by President Donald Trump on January 8, 2019, regarding the immigration issue at the southern border of the United States. Trump highlights the growing humanitarian and security crisis caused by illegal immigration. He mentions the strain on public resources, the negative impact on jobs and wages, and the influx of illegal drugs. The President emphasizes the need for border security measures to combat criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. He presents a detailed proposal developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents, which includes cutting-edge technology, more agents and judges, and a physical barrier. Trump argues that the border wall would pay for itself and be indirectly funded by the new trade deal with Mexico. He criticizes Democrats for refusing to acknowledge the crisis and for not providing funding for border security, leading to the government shutdown. The President invites Congressional leadership to the White House to find a solution. Trump addresses the argument that a barrier is immoral, stating that wealthy politicians build walls to protect their loved ones inside, and not out of hate for those outside. He shares stories of Americans killed by illegal immigrants and calls for Congress to take action in order to prevent further loss of innocent lives. Trump concludes by urging citizens to contact Congress and demand the securement of the border.
