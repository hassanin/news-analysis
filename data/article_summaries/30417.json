Consumer spending in the US increased by 0.6 percent in October, the fastest pace in seven months, according to the Commerce Department. This was a significant improvement from the 0.2 percent growth in September. Incomes also rose by 0.5 percent in October, the largest increase in nine months. These positive indicators suggest future economic growth. The rise in spending was driven by purchases of durable goods, such as cars, and non-durable goods and services, including utility payments. The increase in incomes was mainly due to higher wages and salaries. Both spending and income growth exceeded economists' expectations.
