The Director of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling, issued a statement expressing concern over the potential cutoff of unemployment insurance for 1.3 million Americans. Sperling argues that it is economically unsound and goes against the values of the country to abruptly cut off these benefits, especially during the holiday season. He emphasizes that these individuals are our neighbors, community members, and fellow parents who rely on this temporary lifeline while actively seeking employment. Sperling points out that historically, emergency unemployment insurance has not been cut off in the face of such long-term unemployment, and doing so now would negatively impact both these families and the economy. Although disappointed that Congress did not extend these benefits before the holidays, Sperling states that President Obama and Democratic Congressional leadership have stressed the urgency of extending the benefits upon Congress's return. He highlights bipartisan legislation put forth by Senators Jack Reed and Heller to extend emergency unemployment insurance for three months, preventing these workers and their families from losing benefits while allowing for further consideration of extension in 2014. Sperling urges both Democratic and Republican Congressional leadership to support this bipartisan solution and pass the Reed-Heller bill.
