Ibrahim al-Asiri, a senior al-Qa'ida bomb maker and terrorist coordinator, was confirmed to have been killed two years ago in a United States counterterrorism operation in Yemen. Al-Asiri was responsible for building explosive devices used in various plots, including the failed Christmas Day 2009 underwear bomb attack and the disrupted printer cartridge bomb plot in 2010. He also constructed a device intended for use against a passenger aircraft in 2012 and the device used in the attempted assassination of the former Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. The death of al-Asiri has significantly weakened al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula, and the United States will continue to pursue terrorists like him until they are no longer a threat to the nation.
