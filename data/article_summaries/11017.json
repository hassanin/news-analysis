President Obama will designate a new national monument in Washington, D.C. to honor the movement for women's equality. The Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument will protect the house that has served as the headquarters for the National Woman's Party since 1929. The monument will preserve an extensive archival collection that documents the history and accomplishments of the movement for women's suffrage and equal rights. The site will be named after former Party president Alva Belmont and Alice Paul, who founded the Party and led the fight for women's equality. Efforts to protect the site have garnered Congressional support and the National Park Foundation has received a $1 million contribution to support the site. President Obama has made equal pay a top priority and has taken steps to fight for pay equity, including signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The White House will also host a Summit on "The United State of Women" to discuss solutions to the challenges women still face. President Obama has also taken actions to combat the pay gap and other issues affecting women in the workforce. These actions include publishing a proposal to collect pay data by gender, race, and ethnicity, directing federal agencies to address the gender pay gap, prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against employees who discuss or inquire about their compensation, hosting the first-ever White House Summit on Working Families, and issuing executive orders to raise the minimum wage and provide paid sick leave. The President has also called on Congress to pass legislation that gives all American families access to paid family and medical leave and to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The President's Council of Economic Advisers has continued to highlight the pay gap and other challenges women face in the workforce and propose policy solutions.
