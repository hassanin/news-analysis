President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in Pennsylvania and has ordered Federal assistance to aid in the recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that occurred from August 10 to August 15, 2018. The Federal funding will be available to Commonwealth and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties affected by the severe storms and flooding include Bradford, Columbia, Lackawanna, Lycoming, Montour, Schuylkill, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Tioga, and Wyoming. Additionally, Federal funding will also be available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures throughout the entire Commonwealth. Steven S. Ward has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and further designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments.
