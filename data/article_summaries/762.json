President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 regarding Yemen will continue beyond its anniversary date of May 16, 2021. The President cites the actions and policies of certain former members of the Yemeni government and others as threats to Yemen's peace, security, and stability. These actions include obstructing the political process and the implementation of a 2011 agreement for a peaceful transition of power. Therefore, President Biden has determined it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
