Vice President Kamala Harris recently convened a meeting in Des Moines, Iowa, to discuss the fight to protect reproductive rights. The event included state legislators, health care providers, advocates, students, and other leaders. The Vice President expressed gratitude for their leadership in defending reproductive health care and emphasized that politicians should not interfere with a woman's right to make her own health care decisions. She highlighted the extreme abortion restrictions being proposed and passed in various states and explained how these restrictions are an attack on basic health care and freedom. The Vice President also discussed efforts by extremists to achieve a nationwide ban on medication abortion, which has been deemed safe and effective by the FDA for over 20 years. Participants at the meeting shared stories of women's lives being put at risk due to limited access to reproductive health care and expressed concerns about the potential impact on other rights, such as contraception and LGBTQI+ rights. The Vice President and local leaders pledged to continue fighting to protect reproductive health care in Iowa and across the nation. This meeting is part of a series of convenings hosted by Vice President Harris, bringing together leaders from different states who are working to protect reproductive health care and abortion access.
