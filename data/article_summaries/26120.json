President Donald Trump has issued a memorandum directing the establishment of the United States Space Command as a functional Unified Combatant Command. The Space Command will be responsible for all space-related operations, taking over the responsibilities previously assigned to the Commander of the United States Strategic Command. The Secretary of Defense has been instructed to recommend officers for nomination and Senate confirmation as Commander and Deputy Commander of the new Space Command. The specific authorities and responsibilities of the Space Command will be included in the next update to the Unified Command Plan. The memorandum also directs the Secretary of Defense to notify Congress and publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
