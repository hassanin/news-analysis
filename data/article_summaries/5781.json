In his 2022 State of the Union Address, President Biden will emphasize his Administration's efforts to combat gun crime and make communities safer. The President's comprehensive strategy focuses on two key policies: investing in crime prevention and increasing the number of community police officers. These policies were originally advanced by then-Senator Biden during the 1990s when the United States faced high crime rates. The strategy also recognizes the role of law enforcement in stopping the flow of illegal guns and targeting individuals responsible for gun crimes. The U.S. Department of Justice has established gun trafficking strike forces and is cracking down on the illegal flow of guns known as the "Iron Pipeline." Additionally, the Justice Department is working with state and local law enforcement to address the root causes of violence in each district and remove repeat gun violence offenders from the streets. President Biden's American Rescue Plan provides funding to cities and states to support community policing efforts. The plan also includes investments in programs that address the causes of crime, such as street outreach, hospital-based intervention, and youth programming. The President has proposed a $5 billion investment in community violence interventions, including a $200 million investment in Fiscal Year 2022. President Biden will also call on Congress to pass gun violence prevention legislation, including background checks for all gun sales, a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, and measures to hold gun manufacturers accountable. The Administration has already taken executive actions to reduce gun violence, including addressing ghost guns, regulating firearm stabilizing braces, and supporting extreme risk protection order legislation. The article highlights the progress made by the Biden-Harris Administration in its first year, including the issuance of executive actions, the deployment of federal law enforcement to support local communities, and the investment of American Rescue Plan funding in community-oriented policing and violence prevention strategies. The Administration has also focused on addressing the root causes of gun violence, such as providing funding for summer jobs, substance abuse and mental health services, and programs to support formerly incarcerated individuals.
