This article is a notice from the President of the United States, Barack Obama, regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Burma. The President issued Executive Order 13047 in 1997, certifying to Congress that the Government of Burma had committed large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in the country. This invoked a prohibition on new investment in Burma by US persons. The President also declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed to national security and foreign policy by the actions and policies of the Burmese government. This national emergency, along with the measures adopted in previous executive orders, is deemed necessary to continue beyond May 20, 2010, due to the ongoing threat posed by the Government of Burma. The notice is to be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
