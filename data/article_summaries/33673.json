During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced that President Trump is donating his 2018 second-quarter salary to the Small Business Administration. The funds will be used for a veterans program called "Emerging Leaders" that helps veterans transition from military life to the private sector and start their own businesses. Sanders also discussed National Security Advisor John Bolton's announcement that the United States will withdraw from the Optional Protocol and Dispute Resolution to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Bolton stated that the United States will review all international agreements that may expose the country to binding jurisdiction dispute resolution in the International Court of Justice. The press briefing also covered questions about the FBI investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the President's comments on Christine Blasey Ford, and the New York Times report on the President's tax history.
