The President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has issued a notice to continue the national emergency with respect to Somalia. This national emergency was initially declared in 2010 due to the deteriorating security situation, violence, acts of piracy, and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia. The emergency was further addressed in 2012 to deal with the export of charcoal, misappropriation of Somali public assets, and acts of violence against civilians. The President has determined that the situation in Somalia continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2010 will remain in effect beyond April 12, 2021. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
