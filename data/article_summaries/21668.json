During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest provided updates on various topics. He offered condolences to the families of those who were aboard EgyptAir Flight 804 and stated that it is too early to definitively say what may have caused the disaster. He also discussed the legislation on Puerto Rico, stating that the administration supports the legislation as a first step in addressing the crisis in Puerto Rico. In response to a question about comments made by the chief of staff to the Hungarian Prime Minister regarding immigration, Earnest stated that he did not see the comments and did not think they were worthy of a response. Earnest also addressed concerns about security at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, stating that the United States has successfully worked with security officials at airports around the world to ensure the safety of international flights arriving in the United States. He also mentioned that the United States has seen a desire from extremists to carry out attacks targeting the international aviation system. Earnest stated that it is too early to comment on what caused the crash of the EgyptAir flight and that investigators are still examining all potential factors. He also discussed the impact of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) on various sectors of the US economy and expressed hope that Congress would act soon to approve the agreement. Earnest did not have any information on whether President Obama had spoken to President Sisi or Hollande or whether the President would address the Puerto Rican people directly or visit the island.
