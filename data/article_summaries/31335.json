The United States is facing the deadliest drug crisis in its history, with approximately 72,000 Americans dying from drug overdoses in 2017. Florida has been particularly hard hit, with drug overdose deaths increasing 47 percent from 2015 to 2016. In response, the Department of Justice is taking action to address the crisis. President Trump has allocated $4 billion to combat opioid abuse, launched a national awareness campaign, and set a goal of reducing opioid prescription rates. Law enforcement is a critical part of the plan, targeting drug traffickers and those involved in the distribution of opioids. The success of this approach can be seen in Manatee County, where overdose deaths dropped by 70 percent after federal prosecutors began targeting synthetic opioid sales. As a result, the Department of Justice is implementing Operation Synthetic Opioids Surge (SOS) in 10 districts with high overdose death rates. This initiative will prosecute every case of illicit synthetic opioid distribution, regardless of the amount of drugs involved. The aim is to weaken drug distribution networks and save lives.
