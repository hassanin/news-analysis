The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new actions by over 20 agencies to strengthen the federal government's ability to deal with the worsening effects of climate change. These actions are outlined in annual agency adaptation progress reports and demonstrate a commitment to integrating climate readiness into every agency's mission and programs. The United States faces increasing climate-related damages, such as extreme weather events, droughts, wildfires, and floods, which have significant impacts on infrastructure and people's lives. Last year alone, the US experienced 20 extreme weather events with losses exceeding $1 billion each, totaling more than $145 billion. The federal government is taking steps to minimize disruptions, enhance working conditions, strengthen supply chains, save taxpayer money, and sustain its mission. President Biden directed agencies to revitalize federal climate adaptation efforts through an executive order in February 2021. In October 2021, federal agencies released climate adaptation plans that identified and addressed their most significant climate risks. The White House also launched an effort to rebuild the federal government's information resources and capacity to act on climate data. The administration has provided training for federal program acquisition managers on managing climate risks, reaching over 250,000 users. Additionally, the administration is working with states, tribes, and local governments to protect communities, economies, and infrastructure from the severe impacts of climate change. The administration has also collaborated with Congress to secure key adaptation investments, including $50 billion for protecting infrastructure against wildfires, heat, and floods, and $4.5 billion for drought preparedness. The 2022 Climate Adaptation Progress Reports highlight significant progress made by agencies in bolstering adaptation and increasing resilience to climate impacts.
