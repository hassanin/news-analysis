The United States government has facilitated the departure of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents from Kabul through a Qatar Airways flight and overland passage to a neighboring country. The Qatar Airways flight carried 19 U.S. citizens, while the overland passage included two U.S. citizens and 11 lawful permanent residents. The U.S. government is working intensively to ensure the safe transit of these individuals and others who wish to leave Afghanistan, but due to the ongoing terrorist threat, specific details of these efforts will not be shared until people are safely out of the country. The U.S. government expresses gratitude to Qatar for their assistance in facilitating operations at Kabul International Airport and ensuring the safety of charter flights. These departures highlight the availability of clear and safe options for Americans to leave Afghanistan from various locations. While some Americans have chosen to take these options, others have decided not to for personal reasons, and that is their right. The U.S. government will continue to provide proven options for leaving, but it is up to the remaining Americans to decide whether to take them.
