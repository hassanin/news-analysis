The Biden Administration has announced two policies to combat COVID-19 and increase vaccination rates in the United States. The first policy is a requirement from the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for employers with 100 or more employees to ensure that their workers are fully vaccinated or undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. Employers must also provide paid time off for employees to get vaccinated and require unvaccinated workers to wear masks in the workplace. This rule will cover 84 million employees.

The second policy is a requirement from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that all healthcare workers at facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid be fully vaccinated by January 4, 2022. This rule applies to more than 17 million workers at approximately 76,000 healthcare facilities, including hospitals and long-term care facilities.

The Biden Administration has previously implemented vaccination requirements for federal employees and contractors. To simplify compliance, the administration has aligned the deadlines for the OSHA rule, the CMS rule, and the federal contractor vaccination requirement. All covered employees must receive their final vaccination dose by January 4, 2022.

The administration is urging all employers to ensure that as many of their workers as possible are vaccinated quickly. Vaccination requirements have been shown to increase vaccination rates by over 20 percentage points in various businesses and organizations. The announcements also clarify that the new rules preempt any inconsistent state or local laws that limit an employer's authority to require vaccination, masks, or testing.

Overall, these policies aim to protect workers, prevent hospitalizations, save lives, and strengthen the economy by increasing vaccination rates across the country.
