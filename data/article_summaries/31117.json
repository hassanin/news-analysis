President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring May 19-25, 2018 as National Safe Boating Week in the United States. In the proclamation, he urges all Americans to familiarize themselves with proper safety procedures and take precautionary actions to ensure the safety of themselves and others while boating. This includes inspecting boats thoroughly, participating in vessel safety checks, monitoring weather conditions, bringing required equipment, filing a float plan, wearing life jackets, and avoiding alcohol. The proclamation also encourages boaters to take advantage of boating safety education opportunities and calls on governors and officials to promote boating safety through events and activities.
