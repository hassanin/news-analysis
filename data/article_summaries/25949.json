President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Iowa due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency protective measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Paul Taylor as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Further designations may be made in the future based on assessments and requests from the state. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
