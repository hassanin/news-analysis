President Biden has signed a National Security Memorandum (NSM) to enhance the cybersecurity of National Security, Department of Defense, and Intelligence Community Systems. The NSM mandates that National Security Systems must implement the same network cybersecurity measures as federal civilian networks. This is in line with the objectives of Executive Order 14028, which aims to improve the nation's cybersecurity. The Biden Administration is focused on prioritizing and elevating cybersecurity as a national security and economic security imperative. Efforts have been made to enhance cybersecurity in critical infrastructure sectors, such as electric and pipelines, resulting in commitments from over 150 utilities to deploy cybersecurity technologies. The administration has also established voluntary cybersecurity goals for critical infrastructure owners and operators and is working closely with the private sector to emphasize the importance of cybersecurity. Internationally, the administration has collaborated with G7 countries to hold nations accountable for harboring ransomware criminals, updated NATO cyber policy, and brought together allies to combat cybercrime and illicit use of cryptocurrency. The NSM signifies the administration's commitment to modernize cybersecurity defenses and protect federal networks.
