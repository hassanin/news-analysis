The article discusses the record-breaking number of Americans who have signed up for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces. It states that 21.3 million Americans have gained coverage under the ACA since the author took office, with 9 million more people gaining coverage. The author attributes this success to their actions to protect the ACA and lower premiums. However, the article also highlights the opposition from Republicans in Congress who want to weaken and repeal the ACA, which would raise costs for millions of people and potentially result in millions losing coverage. The author emphasizes the importance of building on the progress made and making lower premiums permanent, while also fighting to bring down healthcare and prescription drug costs.
