The United States and Turkey have reached an agreement to end hostilities in the border region of Syria. Turkey has agreed to pause its offensive for 120 hours to allow the United States to facilitate the withdrawal of YPG forces from the Turkish-controlled safe zone. The U.S. has already begun to facilitate the withdrawal. The two governments are committed to a peaceful safe zone in northeast Syria. The agreement reaffirms the relationship between the U.S. and Turkey as NATO members and acknowledges Turkey's legitimate security concerns. Both countries are committed to protecting NATO territories and populations and upholding human rights. They will also coordinate on counter-terrorism activities and the safety of civilians in the safe zone. The agreement emphasizes the political unity and territorial integrity of Syria and the UN-led political process. The safe zone will be primarily enforced by the Turkish Armed Forces. The U.S. has agreed not to impose further sanctions once the operation is paused. Both parties are committed to working together to implement the goals outlined in the agreement.
