White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Montgomery, Alabama. She addressed questions about President Biden's stance on codifying Roe v. Wade and the filibuster, as well as the leaked draft of Justice Alito's opinion on abortion rights. Psaki emphasized the need to protect women's reproductive rights and the challenges faced in Congress due to the lack of support for the Women's Health Protection Act. She also discussed the administration's efforts to expand access to reproductive healthcare services and the potential impact of overturning Roe v. Wade on women, particularly those in lower income brackets and communities of color. Psaki mentioned that the President has directed his Gender Policy Council and the White House Counsel's Office to prepare options for an administration response to the attack on abortion rights. She also addressed other topics such as the visit to a factory in Alabama, the detention of basketball player Brittney Griner in Russia, and the situation in Ukraine.
