On December 2, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden participated in the National Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony. The event, organized by the National Park Service Foundation and hosted by Mickey Mouse, is a long-standing tradition that marks the beginning of the holiday season. This year's theme, "Magic, Wonder, and Joy," was announced by Jill Biden earlier in the week. The President highlighted the importance of simple acts of kindness, strengthening bonds with family and friends, and remembering the nation's unity and goodness. The ceremony also honored the 43 members of Team USA who represented the country at the Invictus Games in September. President Biden concluded his remarks by wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and expressing gratitude for the blessings of being Americans.
