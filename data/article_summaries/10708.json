Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes is traveling to Cuba for official meetings, cultural engagements, and to witness the signing of a U.S.-Cuba Law Enforcement Memorandum of Understanding. The MOU will strengthen the partnership between the two countries on counternarcotics, counterterrorism, legal cooperation, and money laundering. This trip follows the recent announcement that the Department of Homeland Security has ended the "wet-foot/dry foot" policy and the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, which are steps towards normalizing relations and bringing consistency to immigration policies. Since President Obama's announcement in 2014, the US and Cuba have worked together to normalize relations, including re-establishing diplomatic relations, opening embassies, expanding travel and commercial opportunities, and collaborating in various areas such as health, agriculture, and environmental cooperation. The goal of the President's Cuba policy is to help the Cuban people achieve a better future and advance the interests of the United States. While there are still differences between the governments, the progress made in the last two years demonstrates the potential for cooperation and building a better future together.
