President Trump presents the Medal of Honor to First Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner, a World War II hero who defended the nation with great valor. Conner enlisted in the Army in 1941 and fought on the front lines for 28 months, being wounded seven times. In January 1945, during the Battle of the Bulge, Conner snuck out of a field hospital to rejoin his unit. He volunteered to go to the front lines and directed artillery fire, killing approximately 50 German soldiers and saving many American lives. Conner survived the attack and was later honored for his bravery.
