The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a fact sheet on U.S.-Nordic collaboration on climate change, the Arctic, and clean energy. The leaders of the United States, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden released a joint statement, emphasizing their commitment to addressing climate change and protecting the Arctic. The leaders recognized climate change as one of the foremost challenges the world is facing and emphasized the need to transition to low carbon economies and create more resilient communities. They also committed to implementing the Paris Agreement, supporting clean energy cooperation, advancing climate action globally, and promoting energy access. The joint statement highlighted the importance of addressing climate change in the Arctic, as temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average and melting permafrost is destabilizing the region. The leaders pledged to work towards conditioning commercial activity in the Arctic on environmental standards and climate change goals. They also committed to protecting marine areas in consultation with indigenous communities and to setting long-term conservation goals. The fact sheet also mentioned the leaders' commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, supporting clean energy deployment, phasing down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), reducing methane emissions, and collaborating on forest conservation. Additionally, the leaders pledged to promote global access to sustainable and affordable energy.
