The United States has announced a plan to build 25 new schools in Jordan as part of the Let Girls Learn initiative, using $100 million in funding. These schools will help alleviate overcrowding in classrooms and accommodate the needs of Syrian refugees in Jordan. The new schools will have modern facilities and technology to enhance the learning experience. This initiative is part of a larger effort by the US government to improve the quality of education in Jordan, with additional programs such as teacher training, remedial courses, and support for out-of-school children. The US government also plans to invest in preventing and responding to early and forced marriages in Syria's neighboring countries. The collaboration between Jordan and the US aims to empower girls through education and improve their future prospects.
