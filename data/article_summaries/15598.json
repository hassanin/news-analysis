President Obama is set to designate three new national monuments in the California desert, totaling almost 1.8 million acres of public land. This move will nearly double the amount of public land protected as national monuments by President Obama. The designations aim to protect natural resources, wildlife habitat, historic sites, and cultural sites, as well as provide recreational opportunities. They will also support climate resiliency in the region and contribute to the President's efforts to address climate change. The new monuments will connect with existing protected lands and establish wildlife corridors, allowing plants and animals to adapt to the impacts of climate change. The three new monuments are Mojave Trails National Monument, Sand to Snow National Monument, and Castle Mountains National Monument. These designations have received support from local governments, tribes, business groups, elected officials, and various stakeholders. They will boost the region's economic activity through increased tourism and outdoor recreation. In addition to protecting land and water, President Obama has prioritized providing opportunities for Americans, especially youth, to experience the natural and cultural richness of national parks and public lands. Programs like Every Kid in a Park have been launched to provide free access to public lands for 4th graders, and efforts are being made to connect underserved youth with nature. Inspired by these initiatives, a project called "Fresh Tracks" is being launched, which will give youth from underserved communities the opportunity to travel and explore different cultures and outdoor environments. Overall, President Obama's actions aim to protect important public lands and ensure that future generations can enjoy and appreciate these natural and cultural areas.
