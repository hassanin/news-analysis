President Obama expresses his appall at the violence and brutality perpetrated by the Syrian government against its own people. He condemns President Assad for his failure to address the legitimate grievances of the Syrian people and for his use of torture, corruption, and terror. President Obama believes that Assad's actions will lead to his regime being left in the past, while the courageous Syrian people will determine the future of their country. The United States will continue to increase pressure on the Syrian regime and collaborate with other countries to isolate Assad's government and support the Syrian people.
