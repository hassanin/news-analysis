White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders held a press briefing to discuss the September jobs report and the state of the American economy. She introduced Kevin Hassett, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who presented slides showing positive economic trends under President Trump. Hassett highlighted increases in small-business optimism, business investment, durable goods orders, and employment for goods-producing industries. He argued that these trends represented a break from previous trends and demonstrated the positive impact of Trump's policies, such as tax cuts and deregulation. The briefing also touched on other topics, including the anonymous op-ed published in The New York Times and the ongoing peace process in the Middle East.
