This article is a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, stating that the national emergency with respect to Libya will continue beyond February 25, 2017. The national emergency was declared in 2011 due to extreme measures taken by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his government against the people of Libya. There was also a risk of misappropriation of Libyan state assets. The Government of National Accord (GNA) has been facing obstacles and continues to deal with spoilers and hardliners. Although the GNA-aligned forces successfully ousted ISIL from Sirte, terrorist groups still pose a threat to Libyan stability and to U.S. and allied interests. Recent clashes between militias highlight the ongoing threat of violence in Libya and the potential for renewed fighting over the country's resources. The letter emphasizes the importance of encouraging dialogue and holding accountable those who obstruct Libya's democratic transition. It concludes that the situation in Libya still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy, necessitating the continuation of the national emergency.
