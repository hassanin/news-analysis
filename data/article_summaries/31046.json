President Donald J. Trump has commuted the prison sentence of Ted Suhl, a businessman from Arkansas who ran faith-based behavioral healthcare treatment centers for juveniles. Suhl was convicted of participating in a bribery scheme to increase Medicaid payments to his company. Although acquitted on some charges, he was sentenced to seven years in prison. Suhl has been described as a pillar of his community and a generous contributor to charities. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former United States Attorney Bud Cummins have strongly supported his request for clemency.
