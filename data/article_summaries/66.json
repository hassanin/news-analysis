The Department of the Interior and seven Colorado River Basin states have reached an agreement to protect the stability of the Colorado River System amidst climate change and drought. This agreement is part of the Investing in America agenda and involves deploying resources for water conservation and improving the river's long-term sustainability. The agreement aims to benefit the 40 million people who rely on the Colorado River Basin for agriculture, drinking water, and power, and is seen as a crucial step towards building a sustainable future for states, Tribes, and communities in the West.
