President Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act, a bipartisan bill that revises the national education law. The new law focuses on high standards, accountability, and closing the achievement gap. It allows states and school districts to develop their own strategies for improvement and reduces unnecessary standardized tests. The law also expands access to high-quality preschools and supports great teachers. The goal of the law is to ensure that all students graduate prepared for college and future careers. President Obama emphasized the importance of education in today's economy and the need to provide every child with a chance to succeed. He thanked the lawmakers, educators, and advocates who worked on the bill and urged everyone to continue working towards making the promise of the law a reality.
