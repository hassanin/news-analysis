This Presidential Memorandum, issued on October 22, 2020, focuses on the pensions of Delphi Corporation retirees and other retirees covered by vulnerable pension plans. The memorandum highlights the plight of salaried and non-unionized Delphi retirees who had their pension plans terminated after the company went bankrupt. These retirees have been challenging the termination of their pension plan in the Federal courts for the past decade. The previous administration failed to protect these retirees' pensions, while their unionized colleagues were able to keep their full pensions through a deal with General Motors. The memorandum expresses concern for the Delphi retirees and the need for reforms to maintain the solvency of pension programs under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The memorandum orders a review by the Secretaries of Treasury, Commerce, and Labor, along with other officials, to evaluate appropriate actions that can be taken to address the lost pension benefits and bring transparency to the termination decision. It also calls for a review of pension plans held by the PBGC and proposes potential legislation to address the insolvency of these plans and maintain the future solvency of the PBGC's programs. The memorandum includes general provisions stating that it does not impair existing authorities or create any enforceable rights or benefits.
