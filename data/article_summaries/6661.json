President Biden has declared a major disaster in South Dakota due to severe winter storms and snowstorms that occurred from December 12 to December 25, 2022. Federal assistance will be provided to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and snow assistance for a continuous 48-hour period. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding. Kenneth G. Clark has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
