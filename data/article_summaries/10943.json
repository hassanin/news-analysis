In this statement, President Obama expresses his disappointment with the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder. He argues that the Voting Rights Act, which has been supported by bipartisan majorities in Congress for almost 50 years, has played a crucial role in protecting the right to vote for millions of Americans. The decision to invalidate one of the act's core provisions, according to Obama, disrupts the established practices that have helped ensure fair voting, especially in areas with a history of discrimination. Despite this setback, the President emphasizes that voting discrimination still exists and calls on Congress to pass legislation that guarantees equal access to the polls for all Americans. He also vows to continue using the power of his administration to ensure a fair and equal voting process.
