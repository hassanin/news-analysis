President Donald J. Trump issued Proclamation 9694 on January 23, 2018, which imposed a safeguard measure for large residential washers. This measure included a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) on imports of washers and covered washer parts. Imports peaked before the safeguard measure was imposed and again at the opening of the second TRQ period. Recent data shows that imported units exceeded the annual limit well before the end of the year. Section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Trade Act authorizes the President to reduce, modify, or terminate an action taken under section 203 when the domestic industry has made a positive adjustment to import competition. After considering the US International Trade Commission's report and a petition from the representative of the domestic industry, it was determined that the domestic industry has made positive adjustments, but increased imports during peak times have impaired the effectiveness of the action. Therefore, modification of the action is warranted. Additional action is necessary to eliminate circumvention of the TRQ by spreading within-quota quantities of imports throughout the year. From February 7, 2020, within-quota quantities of 1.2 million washers will be allocated on a quarterly basis during the third year of the action. The modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) made by this proclamation will be effective from February 7, 2020, and will continue unless expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.
