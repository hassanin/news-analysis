On February 15, 2019, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency concerning the southern border of the United States due to a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens national security. The ongoing crisis continues to pose a threat to the American people and further action is needed to address the humanitarian crisis, control unlawful migration, and the flow of narcotics and criminals across the southern border. Therefore, President Trump has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act.
