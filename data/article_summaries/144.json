President Biden has declared a major disaster in the State of New York due to a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred from December 23 to December 28, 2022. This declaration allows for Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The Federal funding will be available for Individual Assistance limited to Funeral Assistance in Erie and Niagara Counties. It will also be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in Erie, Genesee, Niagara, St. Lawrence, and Suffolk Counties. Additionally, Erie and Niagara Counties will receive Federal funding for snow assistance for a continuous 48-hour period during or proximate to the incident period. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for Federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Lai Sun Yee has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
