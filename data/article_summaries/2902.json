Vice President Kamala Harris visited Dalton, Georgia, where she spoke about the importance of investing in clean energy and U.S.-based manufacturing. She highlighted the resilience of the community, which faced job losses during the housing market collapse in the late 2000s but rebounded by partnering with Qcells, a global clean energy company, to build a solar panel factory. The factory in Dalton is now one of the largest solar panel factories in the U.S. Harris announced that Qcells has received an order for two and a half million solar panels, which will be used by Summit Ridge Energy to build solar arrays in several states. These community solar projects will provide access to solar power for people who may not have been able to install solar panels on their own roofs. The order will generate enough electricity to power 140,000 homes and the electricity will be 10% cheaper than traditional power. Harris emphasized that investing in clean energy and U.S.-based manufacturing is an investment in America and its people, and that the Biden administration is committed to creating opportunities for every community.
