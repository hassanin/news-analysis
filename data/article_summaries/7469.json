President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued an executive order to combat discrimination and eliminate disparities faced by LGBTQI+ individuals and their families in the United States. The order acknowledges the progress made in advancing freedom and equality for LGBTQI+ Americans but recognizes that systemic discrimination and barriers still exist. The order aims to address these disparities by taking actions such as protecting LGBTQI+ individuals' access to healthcare, supporting LGBTQI+ students in schools, addressing harmful conversion therapy practices, and promoting inclusion and support for LGBTQI+ youth in the foster care and juvenile justice systems. The order also seeks to prevent and address LGBTQI+ homelessness and housing instability, strengthen supports for LGBTQI+ older adults, and promote inclusive and responsible federal data collection practices to better measure and address disparities faced by LGBTQI+ individuals. The order requires various federal agencies to develop and release sample policies, provide guidance and training, seek funding opportunities, and submit progress reports on implementing the order's provisions.
