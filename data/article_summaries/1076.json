In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki discussed several topics. She highlighted the one-year anniversary of the American Rescue Plan (ARP), which has contributed to the country's economic recovery and provided support for fighting the pandemic. Psaki specifically focused on ARP's investments in higher education, including community colleges and historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). She also announced a new report from the President's competition agenda, which addresses the lack of labor market competition and its negative impact on wages and economic growth. Additionally, Psaki previewed President Biden's upcoming trip to Fort Worth, Texas, where he will discuss healthcare and benefits for veterans affected by environmental exposures. In the Q&A portion of the briefing, Psaki addressed topics such as U.S. engagement with Venezuela, the impact of gas prices on Americans, the possibility of banning Russian oil imports, COVID-19 vaccine policies, and the situation in Ukraine.
