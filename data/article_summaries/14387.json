President Obama announced that the United States is taking aggressive action to stop the global spread of the H1N1 influenza virus. The US will make 10% of its H1N1 vaccine supply available to other countries through the World Health Organization (WHO). This is being done in collaboration with Australia, Brazil, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The US will provide the vaccine to the WHO as supplies become available, in order to assist countries that may not have direct access to it. The Food and Drug Administration has officially licensed the H1N1 vaccine, and it has been determined that one dose instead of two will be effective in developing immunity in most adults. The vaccine will be available in the coming weeks, earlier than expected. The US encourages other nations to join in this global health effort to limit the spread of the disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and save lives.
