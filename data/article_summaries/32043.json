The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has released a report stating that sarin was used as a chemical weapon in al-Lataminah, Syria, on March 30, 2017. The report highlights the need for the U.N. Security Council to renew the U.N.-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), which is responsible for determining responsibility for such attacks. The United States is calling on all responsible nations to vote in favor of extending the JIM, as countries that do not support renewal or attempt to weaken its mandate are seen as protecting the Assad regime and terrorists who use chemical weapons. The statement emphasizes the importance of stopping the use of chemical weapons and urges Russia to change course.
