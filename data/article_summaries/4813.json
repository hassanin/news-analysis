President Biden has commuted the sentences of 31 individuals convicted of drug offenses. The commutations vary in terms of the offenses committed and the length of sentences. In each case, the sentence has been commuted to expire on June 30, 2023, with the remainder of the sentence to be served in home confinement. The terms of supervised release and any fines remain intact. The individuals involved were convicted of offenses such as possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine.
