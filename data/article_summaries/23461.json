On June 26, 2009, President Obama made a statement regarding the passage of the American Clean Energy and Security Act by the House of Representatives. He called it a historic action that would create new industries and jobs, reduce dependence on foreign oil, and limit pollution. He urged the Senate to take the next step and expressed confidence that they would address the challenge and seize the opportunity. The President acknowledged that there were differing views on the issue, with some arguing for the status quo, but he believed that leading in clean energy would also lead to global economic leadership. He thanked Speaker Pelosi and committee chairs for their efforts in crafting the bill. The President highlighted that this bill, along with other actions, aimed to incentivize clean energy and transition to a cleaner economy. He looked forward to working with the Senate to pass the bill and confront the energy challenge facing America.
