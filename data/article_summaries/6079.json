President Biden is en route to Poughkeepsie, New York, where he will visit an IBM site to meet with workers, tour the site, and give remarks. During the visit, IBM will announce a $20 billion investment over the next decade in research and development (R&D) into semiconductors, mainframe technology, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. The investments are expected to create manufacturing jobs in the United States. The President will be joined by New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Congressmen Sean Patrick Maloney, Paul Tonko, and Pat Ryan. Intel CEO Arvind Krishna will also be present.

Brian Deese, Director of the National Economic Council, will join the tour and discuss the domestic manufacturing boom, the strong labor market, and answer questions on economic developments. Additionally, the White House will host fall garden tours this weekend, marking the first time since the pandemic started that the White House gardens will be open to the public. The President and First Lady will honor White House grounds superintendent Dale Haney for his 50 years of service in maintaining the gardens.

Regarding the recent OPEC decision to cut production, the administration's strategy is to maintain sufficient global energy supply to stabilize and lower prices while putting pressure on Russia. The administration believes the OPEC decision is unnecessary given the ongoing challenge of low oil supply. The President has directed that all options be considered, including measures such as reducing retail gasoline prices, utilizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and consulting with Congress on legislation like the NOPEC Act. The administration is also closely engaging with allies and partners on energy challenges. The Department of Energy is finalizing rulemaking to repurchase oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

In terms of the broader economic perspective, while the administration is addressing immediate challenges, such as rising gas prices and the labor market transition, it is also focused on a long-term economic strategy to build a more resilient economy with a stronger industrial base and a revitalized American manufacturing industry. The administration believes that these investments will have a positive impact on communities and create economic opportunities. However, there may be a need for better communication to ensure that the American people recognize the administration's efforts in building the economy.
