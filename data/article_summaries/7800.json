President Biden has signed an Executive Order aimed at improving cybersecurity and protecting federal government networks in the wake of recent cyber incidents such as SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange, and the Colonial Pipeline attack. The order focuses on several key areas. First, it removes barriers to information sharing between the government and the private sector, ensuring that IT service providers can share breach information. Second, it modernizes and implements stronger cybersecurity standards within the federal government, including the adoption of secure cloud services and a zero-trust architecture. Third, it aims to improve software supply chain security by establishing baseline standards for software development and creating a pilot program for a security label similar to an "energy star" rating. Fourth, the order establishes a Cybersecurity Safety Review Board to analyze and make recommendations following significant cyber incidents. Fifth, it creates a standardized playbook for responding to cyber incidents and improves the detection and response capabilities of federal government networks. Finally, it enhances investigative and remediation capabilities by implementing cybersecurity event log requirements for federal departments and agencies. The Executive Order is seen as a significant step towards modernizing cybersecurity defenses, but it also emphasizes the need for private sector companies to take ambitious measures to enhance their cybersecurity investments.
