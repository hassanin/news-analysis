In President Biden's first year in office, the Biden-Harris Administration has implemented an industrial strategy to revitalize domestic manufacturing, create jobs, strengthen supply chains, and accelerate future industries. This has led to a historic recovery in manufacturing, with 642,000 manufacturing jobs added since 2021. The construction of new manufacturing facilities has also increased significantly. President Biden has signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 into law, which will further strengthen American manufacturing, supply chains, and national security. It will also invest in research and development, science and technology, and the workforce of the future, focusing on industries like nanotechnology, clean energy, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Companies have announced nearly $50 billion in additional investments in American semiconductor manufacturing, bringing total business investment to nearly $150 billion since President Biden took office. The CHIPS and Science Act will boost American semiconductor research, development, and production to ensure U.S. leadership in this crucial technology. It will also support and advance scientific and technological advancements in the country. The law includes provisions to ensure equitable economic growth and development, prevent certain facilities from being built in countries of concern, and support good-paying, union construction jobs. It will establish a technology, innovation, and partnerships directorate at the National Science Foundation (NSF) to focus on various fields, and strengthen the commercialization of research and technology. The Act will also reauthorize and expand research at the Department of Energy Office of Science and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to sustain U.S. leadership in the sciences and engineering.
