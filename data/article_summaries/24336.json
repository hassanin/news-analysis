President Barack Obama has proclaimed June 2016 as National Oceans Month in the United States. The proclamation highlights the importance of oceans, which cover over 70 percent of the Earth's surface, in sustaining life and supporting various industries such as tourism, trade, and transportation. The proclamation also emphasizes the need for good ocean stewardship and efforts to preserve the health and resilience of oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes. It acknowledges the threats posed by pollution and climate change, particularly in the Arctic region, and calls for measures to safeguard the oceans. The National Ocean Policy, a coordinated effort to support local communities and improve the health of oceans, is mentioned as an ongoing initiative. The proclamation encourages Americans to take action to protect, conserve, and restore oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.
