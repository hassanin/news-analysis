The Trump Administration has launched a series of public awareness ads to address the opioid crisis, with a focus on preventing young adults from misusing or abusing opioids. The campaign is a collaboration between the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Ad Council, and the Truth Initiative. The first four ads depict real-life stories of young adults going to extreme lengths to maintain their prescription opioid addiction, aiming to show how quickly addiction can occur and the desperate measures individuals may take to continue drug use. This is the first of many ad campaigns targeted at different audiences and aspects of the opioid crisis. President Trump has made combating drug abuse and the opioid crisis a priority since day one of his administration. The campaign is part of the President's Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse, which aims to reduce drug demand through education and awareness, preventing over-prescribing, cutting off the flow of illicit drugs, and expanding access to treatment. The ads can be viewed at opioids.thetruth.com.
