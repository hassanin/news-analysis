President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and ordered Federal assistance to aid in the recovery efforts from the earthquakes that began on December 28, 2019. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals and municipalities. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to support individuals and business owners affected by the disaster. Federal funding is also available to eligible local governments and certain nonprofit organizations for emergency work. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional assistance may be designated as assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can start applying for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.
