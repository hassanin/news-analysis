During a press conference on the South Lawn, President Biden provided an update on the debt ceiling deal, expressing optimism about its passage in Congress. He mentioned speaking with various members, including McConnell, and feeling good about the deal. When asked why he doesn't publicly endorse the deal, Biden responded that it wouldn't help him get it passed. He also mentioned speaking to President Erdogan and congratulating him, as well as discussing the F-16s and a deal with Sweden. When asked about House Democrats who have reservations about the compromise bill, Biden simply said, "Talk to me." He emphasized that he wouldn't disclose what he would tell them and questioned if publicly endorsing the deal would help its passage. On the topic of the 2024 Republican field, Biden admitted he hadn't been keeping up with it but noted the presence of competent candidates. When asked if he would personally whip votes among Democrats and progressives, Biden said he had already made some calls but was unsure about getting progressives on board. Regarding who got the better deal, Democrats or Republicans, Biden responded that it was a bipartisan deal. He expressed confidence that the deal would be done by June 5th, adding that it should receive votes in both houses. When asked about Russia's attacks on Kyiv, Biden acknowledged that it was not unexpected and emphasized the need to support Ukraine. He also mentioned discussing Sweden's membership in NATO with Erdogan and planning to talk more about it next week. On the issue of ATACMS for Ukraine, Biden confirmed it was still in play. In response to concerns about defense spending, Biden stated that if there was an existential need for additional funding, it would be jointly addressed. The press conference concluded with questions about Uganda and President Trump's potential pardoning, to which Biden responded that he didn't have a message for Uganda at the moment and laughed off the question about pardoning Trump.
