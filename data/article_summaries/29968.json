On October 21, 1995, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency with regard to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia. This was done to address the threat posed to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States by these traffickers, as well as the extreme level of violence, corruption, and harm caused by their actions. The national emergency and the measures taken to deal with it were set to expire on October 21, 2018. However, due to the continued threat posed by these traffickers, President Trump has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This decision has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
