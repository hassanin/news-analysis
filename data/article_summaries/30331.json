President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring December 2020 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the dangers of impaired driving caused by alcohol, drugs, and certain medications, highlighting the impaired judgement, decreased coordination, and slowed reaction time that can make operating a motor vehicle unsafe. While impaired driving deaths have decreased by over 30% in the past three decades, the proclamation acknowledges that there are still too many Americans making the thoughtless decision to drive impaired, resulting in nearly 30 deaths per day. The administration is committed to addressing this issue and has been working with law enforcement officers and public safety professionals to provide resources and support to keep the roads safe. Initiatives like the website www.FindTreatment.gov and the Rural Community Toolbox are assisting those with substance use disorder, while ride-sharing and Advanced Vehicle Technologies are providing safer alternatives to impaired driving. The proclamation calls on all Americans to make responsible decisions, drive sober, and contribute to reducing crashes, injuries, and fatalities on the nation's roads.
