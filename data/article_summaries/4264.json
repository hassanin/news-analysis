Today, President Biden will be delivering remarks alongside Prime Minister Morrison of Australia and Prime Minister Johnson of the UK to announce the creation of a new trilateral security partnership called AUKUS. The partnership aims to strengthen cooperation on defense capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region. The three leaders will also announce a shared ambition to support Australia's acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines. This initiative is seen as a significant strategic step for Australia and will deepen the partnership between the US, UK, and Australia. The partnership will focus on joint capabilities, interoperability, information and technology sharing, and integration of security and defense-related science, technology, and industrial bases. The goal is to enhance deterrence and maintain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. The officials emphasized that this partnership is not aimed at any one country, but is part of a larger effort to sustain the rules-based order in the region.
