President Obama announced $2.4 billion in funding to support the production of next-generation electric vehicles and advanced battery components. The initiative aims to create tens of thousands of jobs and reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil. The Department of Energy (DOE) will provide grants to U.S. manufacturers for battery production, other electric vehicle components, and the demonstration of plug-in hybrids and electric infrastructure concepts. The funding will also support the construction or upgrading of battery manufacturing plants and production factories for electric drive vehicle power electronics. The DOE will also support demonstration, evaluation, and education projects to develop the market for advanced electric drive vehicles. The goal is to put one million plug-in hybrid vehicles on the road by 2015. The funding is part of the President's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
