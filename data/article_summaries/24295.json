President Obama has declared a major disaster in Kentucky and ordered federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in the area affected by severe storms, tornadoes, winds, flooding, landslides, and mudslides during July 11-20, 2015. The funding will be available to affected individuals, counties, state, tribal, and eligible local governments, and certain nonprofit organizations. Assistance can include grants for housing and repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help with recovery. Hazard mitigation measures are also available for the entire state. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling FEMA.
