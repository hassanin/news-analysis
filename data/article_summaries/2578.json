The United States will be hosting the APEC Leaders Meeting in San Francisco, California in November 2023 as part of the country's 2023 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Host Year. President Biden and his administration are committed to promoting economic growth and prosperity for the American people and the Indo-Pacific region. California, known for economic innovation, is considered an ideal location for the event. The United States aims to strengthen its economic relationships in the Indo-Pacific by increasing trade flows and the free flow of capital, which supports millions of American jobs. During the host year, the focus will be on sustainable economic growth and making new sustainability and decarbonization commitments with APEC economies.
