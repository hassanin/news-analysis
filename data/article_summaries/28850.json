The Presidential Memorandum titled "Space Policy Directive 7: The United States Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Policy" establishes implementation actions and guidance for United States space-based positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) programs and activities. The policy aims to ensure the responsible use of space-based PNT services for national and homeland security, civil, commercial, and scientific purposes. It complements existing guidance and policies on PNT services and supersedes a previous directive from 2004. The policy directive provides definitions for key terms and outlines the scope of the guidance. It also establishes policy goals and guidance, including continuous worldwide access to US space-based GPS services, improvement of NAVWAR capabilities, enhancement of cybersecurity for GPS, and promotion of international cooperation on PNT services. The directive assigns specific roles and responsibilities to various government agencies, such as the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Transportation, and Secretary of Homeland Security. The National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee is designated as the interagency body responsible for guiding and preserving the government's interests in space-based PNT services. The directive also emphasizes the need to monitor and address foreign threats to the use of GPS services and calls for the notification of harmful disruptions or manipulations of US space-based PNT services. Overall, the policy directive aims to maintain US leadership in the provision of space-based PNT services and ensure their secure and responsible use.
