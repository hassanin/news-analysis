On January 8, 2019, the President signed two laws into effect. The first one is H.R. 2200, which is the "Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2018." This law reauthorizes and modifies the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. The second law is S. 3191, known as the "Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018." This law requires the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to establish a collection of civil rights cold cases related to certain federal crimes between 1940 and 1979. It also establishes an independent board called the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board, which will facilitate the review, transmission to NARA, and public disclosure of civil rights cold case records.
