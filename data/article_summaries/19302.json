President Obama has issued an Executive Order to cut the Federal Government's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 40 percent over the next decade from 2008 levels. This will save taxpayers up to $18 billion in energy costs and increase the share of renewable energy consumed by the Federal Government to 30 percent. Major Federal suppliers have also committed to reducing their own GHG emissions, resulting in a total reduction of 26 million metric tons by 2025. The Administration is releasing a new scorecard to publicly track emissions disclosure and progress for major Federal suppliers. The new commitments align with the United States' international commitment to cut net GHG emissions 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The Executive Order also includes additional measures to make the Federal Government's operations more sustainable, efficient, and energy-secure. Several major Federal suppliers, such as IBM, GE, Honeywell, and HP, have announced their own GHG reduction goals and initiatives.
