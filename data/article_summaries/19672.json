The White House has sent a message to the Senate regarding Annex VI of the Antarctic Treaty. The Annex, which deals with liability arising from environmental emergencies, was adopted in 2005. The White House believes that Annex VI is in the best interest of the United States as it helps protect the environment of Antarctica and holds operators accountable for their actions. The Department of State has provided a report explaining the Annex, and implementing legislation will be submitted to Congress separately. The White House recommends that the Senate consider and ratify Annex VI.
