The Office of First Lady Michelle Obama, the George W. Bush Institute, and the U.S. Department of State hosted a symposium for African spouses, announcing investments of over $200 million in programs that will empower more than 1 million people in Africa. The investments will focus on education, health, and economic development through public-private partnerships. Some of the announcements include a $200 million initiative to double the number of children receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS, the creation of women's business centers in sub-Saharan Africa, a collaboration to bring more than 600,000 young women online in Nigeria and Kenya, and the training of one million farmers, half of whom will be women, by the end of 2016. Additionally, six organizations made commitments to support the expansion of the Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon initiative into Ethiopia and Namibia. The symposium featured African first ladies and leaders from various organizations.
