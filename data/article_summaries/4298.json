President Biden had a virtual bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, which lasted for about three and a half hours. The meeting facilitated a different kind of conversation compared to phone calls, as the leaders were able to interact and have a substantial back-and-forth. The conversation was respectful, straightforward, and open. They discussed ways to manage the competition between the US and China responsibly and establish guardrails for that competition. They had a healthy debate on various issues and discussed both areas of alignment and areas of disagreement. Some specific topics discussed include Taiwan, human rights, economic issues, and Iran. President Biden reaffirmed the US "One China" policy and expressed concerns about Beijing's behaviors. The meeting did not result in a breakthrough, but it aimed to establish a steady state in the US-China relationship where both countries can take competitive actions while keeping open lines of communication and working together where their interests intersect.
