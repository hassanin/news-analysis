The article discusses the continuation of a national emergency declared by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on February 10, 2021, regarding the situation in Burma. The national emergency was declared in response to the military coup on February 1, 2021, where the military overthrew the democratically elected civilian government and unjustly arrested and detained government leaders, politicians, human rights defenders, journalists, and religious leaders. This action undermined the country's democratic transition and rule of law, posing an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The national emergency, initially declared for two years, is now extended for an additional year, until February 10, 2023. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
