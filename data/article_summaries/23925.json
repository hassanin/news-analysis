The White House Office of the Press Secretary has announced an important framework to accelerate the conversion of closed automotive plants as a result of GM's bankruptcy. The framework will invest over $800 million to make the plants productive again, generate jobs, and promote economic development in communities across the country. The federal framework will be discussed with states and the debtor to finalize a plan for the use of these funds. The announcement was made at a conference on automotive communities organized by the White House Council, the US Department of Labor, the Brookings Institution, and the Funders' Network for Smart Growth and Livable Communities. The framework will allocate funds for the decontamination of properties and to help states and communities deal with challenges such as property taxes, demolition costs, and plant security expenses. The funds will be allocated to over 90 projects in 14 states and will cover unexpected expenses as needed. The framework is the result of a rigorous effort by the federal government, with input from participating states, to determine the likely cost of decontaminating the properties involved. Once implemented, it will be the largest trust created for debtor property decontamination. The goal is to have the framework in place by the end of the year. The announcement also included the release of the Council's first Annual Report, which describes the government's efforts to support the automotive sector, workers, and communities affected by the industry's crisis. The report highlights examples of the Council's work in individual communities across the country.
