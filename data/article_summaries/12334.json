President Obama is set to make his first foreign visit as President to Canada. He will meet with the Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, and discuss various issues including the economy, energy and the environment, and global security challenges. The President will be accompanied by key White House staff members such as Larry Summers and Carole Browner. They will also discuss trade, with a focus on the economic recovery plans of both countries. Additionally, they will discuss cooperation on clean energy technology and the possibility of a partnership among the three North American countries. The President will express appreciation for Canada's efforts in Afghanistan and discuss upcoming summits. He will also address concerns about the "Buy American" provisions in the stimulus package and emphasize the importance of avoiding practices that could further decline international trade. The President hopes to make progress on cooperative energy technologies and carbon abatement targets. The trip to Ottawa is seen as an opportunity to send a message globally and revitalize alliances.
