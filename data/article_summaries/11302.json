General John M. Shalikashvili, a soldier-statesman, passed away, leaving behind an extraordinary life that embodied the promise of America. He immigrated to the United States as a Polish teenager after World War II and rose to the highest ranks of the military. As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he strengthened alliances in Europe and Asia, improved defense ties with Russia, and advocated for the Partnership for Peace with the former Soviet states. He also oversaw successful military operations in Bosnia, Haiti, and other places. Above all, he worked tirelessly to enhance the lives of those who serve in the military and their families. The President and First Lady extend their condolences to General Shalikashvili's wife and son.
