This article is a press release from the White House announcing the revocation of certain Sudan-related sanctions. The President of the United States, Barack Obama, has determined that the actions taken by the Government of Sudan in the past 6 months, including a reduction in offensive military activity, improvement of humanitarian access, and cooperation in addressing regional conflicts and terrorism, warrant the revocation of certain sanctions. Effective July 12, 2017, sections of previous executive orders related to Sudan are revoked. The President has also waived certain sections of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act and the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury are assigned various functions related to the implementation of these actions. The Secretary of State will provide a report to the President on whether Sudan has sustained the positive actions, and this report will be made public. The Secretary of State will also provide annual updates on Sudan's actions and recommendations for appropriate responses. The order is effective as of January 13, 2017, with certain sections becoming effective on July 12, 2017, pending the publication of a notice stating that Sudan has sustained the positive actions.
