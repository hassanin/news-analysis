The President's FY2015 budget aims to achieve economic security and expand opportunity for all Americans. It proposes closing unfair tax loopholes to invest in infrastructure, job training, and preschool. The budget also includes tax cuts for working Americans, such as an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which would benefit 13.5 million workers. Additionally, the budget proposes tax cuts to help middle-class and working families afford childcare, college education, and retirement. These tax cuts would be offset by closing tax loopholes used by high-income professionals. The budget also includes measures to strengthen the EITC and Child Tax Credit, make permanent improvements to these credits, and expand tax benefits for middle-class and working families, such as the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and automatic Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). It also aims to simplify taxes for Pell Grant recipients and provide tax relief to student loan borrowers.
