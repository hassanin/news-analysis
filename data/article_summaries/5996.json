President Biden and the President of the Republic of Korea, Yoon Suk Yeol, will tour the Samsung Electronics Pyeongtaek Campus, showcasing the new Samsung plant being constructed in Taylor, Texas. The visit aims to highlight the benefits of alliances and investments in manufacturing, including job creation and supply chain strengthening. The United States and the ROK have significant trading and investment partnerships, with Korean firms investing over $62 billion in the US, supporting 94,000 American jobs. President Biden will use the opportunity to advocate for the quick passage of the Bipartisan Innovation Act, which will provide federal investments in research, development, supply chains, and domestic manufacturing. The act includes funding for the CHIPS Act, which aims to catalyze private-sector investments and promote American technological leadership. These investments will also help make supply chains more resilient, reducing costs and protecting against disruptions and inflation. The Biden-Harris Administration has been working with Congress, allies, and the private sector to boost semiconductor manufacturing capacity, address bottlenecks, and lower costs. As a result, Samsung is investing $17 billion in a new semiconductor facility, adding to the 20,000 jobs it already supports in the US. President Biden has prioritized tackling inflation and aims to cement American leadership in future industries. His administration has seen the creation of 6.6 million new jobs and an increase in manufacturing jobs, with 2021 experiencing the highest growth in US manufacturing jobs in nearly 30 years. The President has also engaged with semiconductor companies and US automakers to strengthen the automotive chip supply chain.
