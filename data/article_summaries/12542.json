President Obama has awarded $2.3 billion in Recovery Act Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credits for clean energy manufacturing projects across the United States. These tax credits will create tens of thousands of high-quality clean energy jobs and support the domestic manufacturing of advanced clean energy technologies. The aim is to build a robust clean energy sector, reduce carbon emissions, and increase energy security. The tax credits will leverage private capital for a total investment of nearly $7.7 billion in high-tech manufacturing. The projects selected cover a range of clean energy technologies, including smart grid, building efficiency, solar energy, and wind energy. The tax credits will help these projects create more than 17,000 jobs.
