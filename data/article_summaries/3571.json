The White House and Department of Agriculture recently held a listening session with representatives from various food and agriculture advocacy organizations to discuss the importance of promoting competition in agricultural markets. Senior officials from the White House and Department of Agriculture emphasized that President Biden has made this a priority in his economic agenda. They explained how industry consolidation in sectors such as meat processing and ocean shipping can limit options for farmers in terms of inputs and selling channels. The officials also highlighted the steps taken by the administration so far to increase competition, transparency, and support new markets in the agriculture sector. They expressed support for further legislative action to protect farmers, promote competition, and diversify supply chains. During the session, participants shared their experiences of how consolidation has negatively impacted family farmers and raised prices for consumers. They acknowledged the progress made by the Biden-Harris administration in investing in independent meat processing, expanding market opportunities, and supporting rural workforce growth. Participants urged the administration to continue their efforts to combat consolidation and expressed support for bipartisan legislation to promote competition in the food supply chain. The officials concluded the meeting by reaffirming the President's commitment to promoting competition and thanked participants for their input.
