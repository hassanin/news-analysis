The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) estimates that the opioid crisis cost the United States $696 billion in 2018, which is 3.4 percent of GDP, and over $2.5 trillion from 2015 to 2018. These costs include healthcare and substance abuse treatment, criminal justice expenses, lost productivity, and the value of lost lives. The CEA's cost estimates are three times higher than those from a recent Society of Actuaries study because they consider the value of a statistical life. The opioid crisis has led to a significant number of overdose deaths, but since January 2017, there has been a decline in opioid-related deaths. CEA estimates that almost 30,000 lives were saved during this period. However, to end the crisis, multiple solutions are necessary, such as increased funding for treatment, education about the dangers of opioids, and improved security to prevent the flow of illicit drugs. The U.S. government has taken steps to address the crisis, including passing the SUPPORT Act and securing $6 billion in funding for opioid abuse prevention. The number of Americans receiving medication-assisted treatment has also increased, and there has been a decline in the total amount of opioids prescribed since President Trump took office. Securing the border to limit the influx of deadly drugs like fentanyl is also crucial. The efforts to combat the crisis have shown some positive results, with drug overdose deaths decreasing in certain states. However, the high cost of the opioid crisis in 2018 indicates that there is still work to be done. The CEA will continue to publish reports on the economic causes and costs of the opioid crisis to help inform public and policymaker understanding.
