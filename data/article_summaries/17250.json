The United States and Germany have a strong collaboration in science and technology (S&T). They have committed to spending 3% of GDP on S&T research and development. There are over 50 bilateral cooperation agreements between US and German government agencies and scientific institutions, as well as over 1,500 university partnerships. In 2010, they entered into an S&T Cooperation Agreement, and the first Joint Committee Meeting will be held in Berlin in September 2011. 

The US priorities for collaboration with Germany include advanced manufacturing, production of lightweight materials, use of modeling and simulation for manufacturing efficiency, and building ties between US federal laboratories and German research institutes. Some ongoing collaborative activities include research on solar photovoltaic materials and systems, clean technologies, qualification standards in the automotive industry, medical and agricultural breakthroughs, technology for national defense and security, space projects, and fundamental science.
