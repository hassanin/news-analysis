This article discusses the efforts made by the Obama Administration to address the primary care workforce needs in the United States. The administration has focused on expanding the primary health care workforce by increasing the number of primary care providers and encouraging them to practice in underserved areas. This has been achieved through investments in the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), which has nearly tripled in size over the past three years and provided care to millions of patients. The Affordable Care Act has also provided funding to train new primary care providers, including medical residents, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. The President's Fiscal Year 2013 budget includes additional funding to expand the capacity and improve the training and distribution of primary care providers. The Affordable Care Act has also supported the training of primary care physicians in community-based settings and the training of advanced practice nurses. Additionally, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act has strengthened the primary care training infrastructure, encouraged physician training in the community, and incentivized the creation of Medicaid "health homes" for individuals with chronic health conditions. The article also highlights the efforts to modernize payment and improve financial incentives for coordinated care, such as providing payment bonuses for primary care providers and realigning financial incentives in accountable care organizations. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation has launched several initiatives to promote primary care, including the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative Demonstration and the Federal Qualified Health Center Advanced Primary Care Practice Demonstration. Overall, these efforts aim to improve access to primary care services and enhance the coordination of care for better health outcomes.
