National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink held a meeting in Honolulu with U.S. Navy Adm. John C. Aquilino and officials from Australia, Japan, and New Zealand to discuss developments in the Pacific Islands. The officials reaffirmed the commitment of the four countries to the Pacific Islands and agreed to intensify engagement in the region to address various challenges, including maritime security, economic development, the climate crisis, and COVID-19. They emphasized the importance of working closely with Pacific Island nations and like-minded countries, both within and beyond the region. The officials also expressed concerns about a proposed security framework between the Solomon Islands and China, highlighting the risks it poses to a free and open Indo-Pacific. This meeting was part of the ongoing consultations between the U.S. and its allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, and it is part of the senior administration's planned travel to Hawaii, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.
