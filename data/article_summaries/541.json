The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) has reached over 16 million households, saving Americans over $500 million per month. The program, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, provides eligible households with up to $30/month off internet bills and up to $100 off a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet. In addition, internet service providers across the country are offering high-speed plans fully covered by the ACP. The Biden-Harris Administration's "Internet for All" initiative aims to close the digital divide by addressing factors such as affordability, infrastructure, devices, and digital skills. The administration has also announced funding for $53 million in state planning funds for digital equity and $175 million for Minority Serving Institutions to enhance high-speed internet infrastructure, purchase equipment, provide digital skills training, and engage with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The administration is committed to ensuring that HBCUs are fully included in expanding affordable high-speed internet access across the country.
