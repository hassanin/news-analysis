Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats and Republicans have taken urgent action to prevent a rail shutdown, which both parties agree would be devastating to the economy and families across the country. The Senate is now urged to act urgently as well. Without a final vote to avoid a shutdown, railroads will halt the movement of critical materials such as chemicals for water cleaning as soon as this weekend. This could lead to disruptions in the auto supply chains, food transportation, and hazardous waste removal from gasoline refineries. The Senate is being called upon to quickly pass a bill for the President's signature.
