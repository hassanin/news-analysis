President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Tennessee, authorizing federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that occurred from July 15-17, 2009. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state, local, and nonprofit organizations for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures. Terry L. Quarles has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
