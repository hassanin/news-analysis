Vice President Biden is set to announce over $2 billion in grants and loans for bringing broadband to communities with limited or no access to the technology. The initial investment of $182 million will benefit eighteen broadband projects in seventeen states, with additional private capital of over $46 million already matched. These awards are expected to create job opportunities in infrastructure and manufacturing, bridge the digital divide, and boost economic development in underserved communities. The new broadband access will enable educational institutions to expand connectivity, facilitate remote medical consultations, attract new businesses, and provide job opportunities. The grants and loans are part of a $7.2 billion investment from the Recovery Act to bring broadband access to underserved communities. The types of awards include middle mile awards, last mile awards, public computing, and sustainable adoption. The National Economic Council has produced a report highlighting how Recovery Act investments in broadband will expand access and adoption, create jobs, and promote economic development. The announcement will take place at Impulse Manufacturing in Dawsonville, GA, a company that requires improved broadband capability to expand its services. The North Georgia Network Cooperative will also benefit from a $33 million award, bringing broadband access to rural Georgia foothill communities. Secretaries Locke and Vilsack will visit other locations to discuss broadband awards that will benefit rural and disadvantaged areas and boost economic development.
