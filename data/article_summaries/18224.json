On July 30, 2012, the President signed into law H.R. 205, also known as the "Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Home Ownership Act of 2012" or the "HEARTH Act of 2012." This act allows federally recognized Indian tribes to lease restricted lands for various purposes, such as business, agriculture, public, religious, education, recreation, or residential, without needing the explicit approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
