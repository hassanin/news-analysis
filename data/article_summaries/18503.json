President Obama had a phone call with President Putin of Russia for an hour. Obama emphasized that Russia's actions in Ukraine are a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. He mentioned that there is a diplomatic way to resolve the situation that addresses the interests of Russia, Ukraine, and the international community. This includes direct talks between Ukraine and Russia facilitated by the international community, international monitors to protect the rights of all Ukrainians, Russian forces returning to their bases, and international support for the Ukrainian people as they prepare for elections in May. Secretary Kerry will continue discussions with Foreign Minister Lavrov and other international partners to advance these objectives.
