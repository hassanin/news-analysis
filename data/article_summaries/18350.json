The President has signed into law H.R. 5986, which includes measures to support domestic manufacturing and strengthen economic ties with sub-Saharan Africa and Central America. The bill extends a key provision under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade preference program, allowing duty-free access to the U.S. market for certain AGOA apparel exports until September 2015. The legislation also includes technical amendments to textile and apparel provisions under the Central America – Dominican Republic – United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), which will benefit American workers and support economic growth in these regions.
