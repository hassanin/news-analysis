President Donald J. Trump has signed into law the "Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act of 2019," which provides $19.1 billion to aid Americans in recovering from recent catastrophic disasters. The legislation includes $4.5 billion for agricultural-related losses, emergency timber restoration, farmland repair, and watershed recovery work. The Corps of Engineers will receive $3.3 billion for repairing damages caused by natural disasters and investing in flood and storm damage reduction projects. The Department of Defense will receive $2.7 billion for repairing and replacing certain installations. Other funding includes $1.6 billion for the Department of Transportation's Emergency Relief Program and additional resources for wildfire suppression activities by the United States Forest Service. President Trump aims to secure funding and improve the implementation of policies to mitigate the risk of natural disasters and enhance the nation's recovery efforts. The administration hopes to work with Congress to address the Fiscal Year 2019 Emergency Supplemental Budget Request for southern border humanitarian needs.
