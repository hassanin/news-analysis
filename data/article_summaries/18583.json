President Obama's fiscal year 2013 Budget aims to expand and simplify the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit. If enacted, the tax credit would benefit nearly half a million employers who provide insurance to four million workers. The proposal would provide an additional $14 billion in tax credits over the next ten years. The President's proposed changes include allowing small businesses with up to 50 workers to qualify for the credit, adopting a more generous phase-out schedule, and simplifying the credit by streamlining the rules. The budget proposal also includes examples of how it would affect various businesses, demonstrating the potential tax savings for eligible small businesses.
