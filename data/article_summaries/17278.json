President Obama has signed an Executive Order creating a Presidential Emergency Board to help resolve a dispute between New Jersey Transit Rail and its employees. The board will have 60 days to obtain final offers for settlement from each side and then produce a report that selects the most reasonable offer. Although the report is not binding, the party whose offer is not selected would be prohibited by law from receiving certain benefits if a work stoppage occurs. The President has appointed Joshua Javits as Chair of the board, along with Elizabeth Neumeier and Nancy E. Peace as members. Javits is a mediator and arbitrator with extensive experience in labor-management disputes, while Neumeier and Peace are both experienced arbitrators and mediators as well.
