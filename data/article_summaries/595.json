President Joseph R. Biden has determined that it is in the national interest of the United States to provide assistance under the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act (MRAA) for urgent refugee and migration needs. The assistance, totaling $976.1 million, will support Operation Allies Welcome and other efforts by the Department of State to relocate individuals at risk due to the situation in Afghanistan. The assistance may be provided bilaterally or multilaterally, including through contributions to international organizations and funding to other non-governmental organizations, governments, and U.S. departments and agencies. The determination will be submitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
