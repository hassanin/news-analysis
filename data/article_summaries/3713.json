The United States strongly condemns North Korea's recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, stating that it is a violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions. While the US military has determined that the test did not pose an immediate threat to its personnel or territory, it raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region. The US calls on all countries to condemn these violations and urges North Korea to cease its destabilizing actions and engage in serious dialogue. The US national security team is working closely with allies and partners, and will take necessary measures to ensure the security of the US, South Korea, and Japan.
