Patient groups, such as the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Easter Seals, American Heart Association, LIVESTRONG, American Lung Association, and over 100 AIDS Service Organizations, are opposing the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. They argue that without a meaningful alternative, repealing the law would resurrect a broken healthcare system that denies lifesaving care to patients. These organizations believe that lack of access to healthcare is linked to later stage cancer diagnoses, higher mortality rates, and devastating consequences for patients and their families. They emphasize that the reforms implemented in the last 10 months have already benefited patients and should be given an opportunity to work and be improved upon if necessary. Additionally, they highlight the impact of the Affordable Care Act on people with lung diseases and those living with HIV/AIDS, urging Congress not to repeal the legislation.
