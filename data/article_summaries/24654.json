President Obama met with the House Democratic Caucus to discuss the importance of working together on various priorities to strengthen the economy, create jobs, and expand opportunity for all. He emphasized the need for collaboration with Congress on shared goals, such as increasing the minimum wage, improving education, passing immigration reform, advocating for equal pay for women, extending unemployment benefits, and implementing other measures to support job creation and middle-class families. The President also highlighted that 2014 is a year of action, and while he will continue to use executive authority, he stressed the significance of congressional cooperation.
