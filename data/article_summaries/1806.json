The United States, Republic of Korea (ROK), and Japan have jointly issued designations targeting officials and entities associated with North Korea's development of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missiles. This action demonstrates the strengthening trilateral relationship between the three countries. It follows President Biden's recent trilateral meeting with the leaders of Japan and ROK, where they condemned North Korea's numerous ballistic missile launches and pledged to enhance deterrence and forge closer ties in security and beyond. Despite comprehensive US and UN sanctions isolating North Korea, the country has resorted to desperate measures like virtual currency heists to fund its weapons programs. Sanctions have slowed down the development of these unlawful programs, but North Korea continues to adapt its tactics. The US and its allies will continue to use all available tools to limit the growth of these destabilizing weapons programs. While diplomacy is not off the table, North Korea must cease its destabilizing actions and engage in diplomatic efforts. Ignoring outreach is not in North Korea's best interest, nor for its suffering people. The US will coordinate closely with its allies and partners to address the threats posed by North Korea and work towards complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
