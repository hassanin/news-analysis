The White House has released a report on the progress made in the Beyond the Border (BTB) Action Plan and the Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) Action Plan with Canada. These initiatives aim to strengthen the economic partnership between the United States and Canada and promote transparency, efficiency, and the free flow of people and goods. The report highlights achievements such as mutual recognition of air cargo security programs, an operational model for inspecting truck cargo before the border, expedited passenger screening at US airports for Canadian travelers, and pilot projects for simultaneous regulatory submissions in both countries. The initiatives will continue to reduce barriers to trade and investment in the future.
