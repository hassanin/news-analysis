President Barack Obama has declared September 18 through September 24, 2011, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. This proclamation recognizes the important role that employers play in supporting members of the National Guard and Reserve. The President acknowledges the sacrifices made by the 9/11 Generation and the millions of volunteers who have served in the military over the past 10 years. He also highlights the vital contributions of the National Guard and Reserve, who not only serve in combat but also provide assistance during natural disasters. The President expresses gratitude to employers who hire and support Guard and Reserve members and their families. He mentions the Joining Forces initiative, which aims to connect service members, veterans, and their families with opportunities and proposes tax credits for businesses that hire returning veterans. The President calls on all Americans to show appreciation for the National Guard and Reserve and their civilian employers, and encourages appropriate ceremonies and activities to observe this week.
