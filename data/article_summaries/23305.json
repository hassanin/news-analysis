The White House Press Secretary released a statement expressing the President's satisfaction with the Senate's bipartisan efforts to create jobs. The draft bill, presented by Senators Baucus and Grassley, includes key priorities such as tax incentives for businesses to hire, tax cuts for small businesses to invest and expand, funding for infrastructure repairs, and assistance for unemployed Americans in the form of extended unemployment insurance and healthcare. The President hopes that this draft bill will lead to a bipartisan Senate bill and looks forward to collaborating with members from both parties on additional job creation measures, such as energy efficiency incentives and increased access to credit for small businesses.
