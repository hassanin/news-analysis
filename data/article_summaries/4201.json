The US Government has implemented a comprehensive response to control and end the Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Guinea. They have committed over $3.5 million in assistance and are working closely with local, national, and international partners. The response efforts include facilitating access to Ebola vaccines and therapeutics, increasing response capacity, strengthening surveillance and case management systems, improving infection prevention and control practices, supporting community engagement activities, and mitigating the risk of spread to the United States. The CDC has issued an order requiring airlines and aircraft operators to collect passenger contact information for public health follow-up. The Department of Homeland Security is directing passengers who have recently traveled from or been present in the DRC or Guinea to specific US airports for enhanced public health measures.
