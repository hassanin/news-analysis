White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki provided an update on President Biden's outreach and engagement regarding his Build Back Better agenda and legislative priorities. The President has been engaging with members of Congress from both parties to discuss the pathway forward on his infrastructure plans. He will be hosting meetings with House members tomorrow, including both moderates and progressives. Psaki emphasized the urgency to get these plans done to address the urgent needs of families, such as high costs, outdated infrastructure, climate change, and an unfair tax system. The President will also be traveling to Scranton, Pennsylvania, to rally support for his infrastructure deal and agenda. Psaki also addressed other topics such as the kidnapping of U.S. citizens in Haiti, China's nuclear capabilities, the confirmation of nominees, voting rights, climate goals, tax enforcement, and the President's travel schedule.
