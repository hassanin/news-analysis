The author expresses disappointment with the Fifth Circuit's decision that DACA is unlawful. Although the court's stay temporarily protects DACA recipients, the author believes that Dreamers' lives are still uncertain. Republican state officials are accused of trying to remove the protections and work authorization that DACA recipients have had for many years. The author urges Congress to pass permanent protections for Dreamers, including a pathway to citizenship. The author's administration is committed to defending Dreamers against attacks from Republican officials and sees this challenge to DACA as part of an extreme agenda pushed by MAGA-Republican officials.
