On World Refugee Day, the United States acknowledges the millions of refugees and internally displaced people around the world. The President highlights the courage of those who have fled persecution and violence, as well as the commitment of countries and organizations providing them with protection and assistance. While efforts are made to promote peace and stability, the President recognizes that some refugees may not be able to return voluntarily to their home countries. In such cases, social, economic, and legal integration in their country of asylum can provide opportunities for rebuilding their lives and contribute their knowledge and skills. The United States has a long history of welcoming refugees and remains a leader in refugee resettlement. The President emphasizes the commitment of the United States, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the international community to protect refugees, alleviate their suffering, and help them live with dignity and peace.
