The article discusses a Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2018. The President has identified several countries, including Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, as major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries. However, being on this list does not necessarily reflect a country's counternarcotics efforts or cooperation with the United States. Bolivia and Venezuela have been designated as countries that have failed to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements. Colombia was also considered for this designation due to the significant increase in coca cultivation and cocaine production in recent years, but it was not designated because of its close partnership with the United States in law enforcement and security efforts. The article also mentions the importance of supporting programs to aid the people of Venezuela for the national interests of the United States. The Presidential Determination will be submitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
