The Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities launched an effort to incorporate equity throughout the federal government. To gather the necessary data for equity assessments and identify barriers to equitable access, President Biden ordered the formation of the Equitable Data Working Group. The Working Group, chaired by Dr. Alondra Nelson and Dr. Margo Schwab, studied existing federal data collection policies and infrastructure to identify inadequacies and provide recommendations for increasing data available for measuring equity. The Working Group identified three priority uses for equitable data: generating disaggregated statistical estimates, increasing access to disaggregated data for research and community efforts, and conducting equity assessments of federal programs. The report outlines a vision for equitable data, including making disaggregated data the norm while protecting privacy, leveraging existing federal infrastructure to utilize underused data, building capacity for robust equity assessments, galvanizing diverse partnerships, and being accountable to the public. The report emphasizes the importance of providing tools for civil society organizations and communities to use and visualize federal data and promoting transparency and accountability with the American public.
