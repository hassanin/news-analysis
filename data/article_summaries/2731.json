The President and the Speaker of the House had a meeting in the Oval Office to discuss the need for a bipartisan agreement to avoid defaulting on the country's debt. They both agreed that default would have negative consequences for the American people and the rest of the world. They also agreed on the need to reduce the deficit, with the President mentioning that he had already reduced it by $1.7 trillion during his first two years in office. However, they disagreed on how to achieve this, with the President advocating for closing tax loopholes and ensuring the wealthy pay their fair share. The Speaker mentioned that there are disagreements but expressed optimism in finding common ground to strengthen the economy, reduce debt, curb inflation, and decrease dependence on China. The President also mentioned the importance of making the appropriations system work efficiently. Overall spending alone is not seen as the solution to the problem.
