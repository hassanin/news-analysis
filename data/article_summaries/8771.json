The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has authorized the use of Novavax's protein-based COVID-19 vaccine for adults, adding it to the list of safe and effective vaccines available in the fight against the virus. The Biden Administration has emphasized the importance of vaccination, with over 260 million Americans receiving their first shot and nearly 110 million people receiving a booster shot. The administration urges people to get vaccinated, especially in light of the BA.5 variant. Vaccines have proven to protect against serious illness, hospitalizations, and death, and it is essential to stay up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations. The administration has worked to ensure easy access to vaccines, treatments, tests, and other tools to combat the virus. While COVID-19 is not over, the goal is to manage the situation and minimize its impact on daily life.
