The article discusses a series of proclamations issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the import of aluminum articles into the United States. The proclamations were made in response to an investigation by the Secretary of Commerce, which found that the import of aluminum articles threatened the national security of the United States. The initial proclamation imposed a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. Subsequent proclamations extended the exemption for imports from the member countries of the European Union (EU) until May 1, 2018, and later, until December 31, 2023. A 2021 agreement between the United States and the EU led to the implementation of a tariff-rate quota, restricting the quantity of aluminum articles imported from the EU without the application of the tariff. The agreement also included measures to address excess capacity and reduce carbon intensity in the steel and aluminum industries. The proclamations state that the agreed-upon measures provide an effective means to address the threat to national security posed by imports of aluminum articles. The proclamations also mention ongoing discussions between the United States and the EU to restore market-oriented conditions and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The current proclamation extends the tariff-rate quota until December 31, 2025, and maintains the current tariff level for other countries. It also includes provisions for in-quota treatment and the requirement of a certificate of analysis for eligible aluminum articles imports. The modifications made by the proclamation will take effect on January 1, 2024.
