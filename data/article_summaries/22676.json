Vice President Joe Biden, along with other officials, has officially kicked off the $32 million renovation and restoration of the Wilmington Train Station in Delaware. The project has been accelerated thanks to $20 million in federal investment funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The 100-year-old station serves over 700,000 passengers annually and is an important transportation hub. The construction work will include various improvements such as new concrete curbing, glass stairwell enclosures, canopies, an ADA accessible raised platform, and restoration of the building's exterior. The project aims to preserve the historic train station while upgrading it with modern technology.
