First Lady Melania Trump visited Boston Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts to highlight the hospital's treatment programs for babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) as part of her Be Best initiative. During her visit, she met with hospital leadership and staff and received a briefing on the hospital's programs focused on the care of mothers and their children. The programs discussed included Project RESPECT, which provides medically assisted treatment to women, Cuddling Assists in Lowering Maternal and Infant Stress (CALM), which utilizes community volunteers to comfort babies with NAS, and the Supporting Our Families Through Addiction and Recovery (SOFAR) Clinic, which focuses on the wellness of families during the recovery process. Melania Trump also toured the hospital's Pediatric Unit and met with children and families enrolled in the SOFAR program to learn about their experiences with NAS and opioid addiction. The First Lady's Be Best initiative aims to raise awareness about NAS and promote resources and programs that help families affected by the opioid epidemic.
