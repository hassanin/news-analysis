The Biden Administration is facilitating the air shipment of approximately 548,000 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Nestlé Alfamino® and Alfamino® Junior specialty infant formula. This week, a flight facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will transport the Nestlé infant formula from Switzerland to Louisville, Kentucky. The delivery includes over 44,000 pounds of Nestlé Health Science Alfamino® and Alfamino® Junior formula. The product will be distributed primarily to hospitals, home health companies, and WIC programs across the U.S. This is part of Operation Fly Formula, which aims to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure it reaches store shelves faster. The Biden Administration has also taken other actions, such as invoking the Defense Production Act and issuing FDA guidance, to ensure an adequate supply of safe infant formula for families.
