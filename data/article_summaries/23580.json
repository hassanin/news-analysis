President Obama has signed a bill awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) who served during World War II. The WASP was established to fly non-combat military missions in the United States, allowing male pilots to focus on combat missions. They were the first women to fly American military aircraft and flew a variety of planes during the war. Over 1,000 women joined the WASP, with 38 of them making the ultimate sacrifice. However, their contributions went unrecognized for many years, and they were not even granted veteran status until 1977. The recognition of the WASP's achievements paved the way for future female combat pilots. The bill was supported by bipartisan efforts led by Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Barbara Mikulski, as well as Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Susan Davis. President Obama signed the bill in the Oval Office, accompanied by three members of the WASP and five active-duty Air Force pilots who have followed in their footsteps.
