President Biden held a press conference with Attorney General Merrick Garland and a group of local officials and police chiefs to discuss efforts to reduce violence and ensure public safety. The President emphasized the importance of funding the police with the necessary resources and training, rather than defunding them. He highlighted the American Rescue Plan, which provided $350 billion directly to cities, counties, and states to invest in crime prevention, hire back police officers, and support community violence interruption and prevention programs. The President urged governors, mayors, and county officials to spend the allocated funds quickly to prioritize public safety, especially as crime rates typically surge during the summer. He also addressed concerns about the shortage of baby formula and outlined the steps his administration is taking to address the issue. In response to questions, President Biden discussed topics such as police reform, human rights in Angola, and his conversations with the leaders of Sweden and Finland.
