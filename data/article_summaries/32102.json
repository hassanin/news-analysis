During a press briefing aboard Air Force One, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross discussed the recent agreement reached between the United States and the European Union (EU) on trade. The agreement aims to move towards zero tariffs, zero non-tariff trade barriers, and zero subsidies, in order to level the playing field between the two parties. Ross emphasized that Europe currently has higher tariffs and trade barriers than the US, which are not science-based and effectively keep products out of their market. The agreement is seen as a vindication of President Trump's trade policy and a step in the right direction for the global trading system. Ross also mentioned that the investigation into auto tariffs will continue, but no decision will be made until the negotiations with the EU are complete. He reassured that overall employment is booming and the steel and aluminum tariffs have not had a negative impact on job creation. Ross clarified that the US has not abandoned negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) and that the cancellation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was meant to signal the desire to negotiate with the EU.
