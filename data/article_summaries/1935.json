In this article, the author discusses the efforts of the Biden administration to address problems in the student loan system and provide relief to borrowers. The administration has approved over $117 billion in debt relief to more than 3.4 million borrowers, including $14 billion for 1.1 million borrowers affected by college closures or exploitation. Recently, the administration approved an additional $37 million in debt cancellation for over 1,200 borrowers who were deceived by the University of Phoenix. The borrowers were misled into believing that attending the university would lead to promising career opportunities at Fortune 500 companies, which turned out to be false. The administration vows to fight against colleges taking advantage of students and borrowers, holding them accountable for their actions. The article also highlights other achievements, such as increasing Pell Grants, fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and creating an Income-Driven Repayment plan called SAVE. The administration is committed to delivering relief to borrowers and will explore alternative paths to achieve student debt relief.
