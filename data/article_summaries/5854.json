President Biden has announced additional actions to address gas prices and promote energy security. He is releasing 15 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be delivered in December, and the Department of Energy will be prepared to release additional oil if needed. The administration is also calling on oil and gas companies to pass on their savings to consumers at the pump. The President is taking these actions in response to the increase in gas prices caused by Putin's war in Ukraine. The administration is also focused on boosting electric vehicle battery production and ensuring a reliable supply of critical minerals used in EVs. The Department of Energy will award $2.8 billion in grants to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles and the electric grid.
