President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Texas due to severe winter storms that started on February 11, 2021. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in various counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation measures. Jerry S. Thomas has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
