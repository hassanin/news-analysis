This article is about an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in 2012, establishing the White House Homeland Security Partnership Council. The purpose of this order was to enhance the Federal Government's use of local partnerships to address homeland security challenges. The Council would foster partnerships between the government and various organizations, such as the private sector, NGOs, foundations, and community-based organizations, as well as state, local, tribal, and territorial government and law enforcement. The Council would be chaired by the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, and its members would be federal officials who have demonstrated an ability to develop and sustain local partnerships. The order also established a Steering Committee to provide guidance to the Council. The Council's mission would be to advise the Chair and Steering Committee on priorities, challenges, and opportunities for local partnerships, promote homeland security priorities, raise awareness of best practices, and convene an annual meeting to exchange findings and progress. The Steering Committee would determine the Council's scope, establish nomination processes and selection criteria, and provide guidance on its activities. The order emphasized the importance of partnerships in addressing the evolving threats to the United States and recognized the need for an all-of-nation effort. The order also stated that it would be implemented consistent with applicable law and protections for privacy and civil liberties.
