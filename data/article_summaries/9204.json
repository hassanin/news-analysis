Last week, the White House held a meeting with civil rights leaders and health insurance providers to discuss the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to lower healthcare costs and ensure access to affordable healthcare for all Americans. The meeting focused on Medicaid redeterminations and the potential negative impact of work reporting requirements, with states that have implemented such policies seeing a significant number of people losing coverage. The Biden-Harris administration expressed a commitment to working with civil rights leaders and stakeholders to protect comprehensive healthcare coverage for all Americans. Participants in the meeting included health insurance providers, associations, and civil rights organizations.
