This article is a presidential memorandum from September 2014, in which President Barack Obama certifies that members of the U.S. Armed Forces participating in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic are not at risk of criminal prosecution or jurisdiction by the International Criminal Court (ICC). This is because the Central African Republic has entered into an agreement under Article 98 of the Rome Statute, which prevents the ICC from taking action against U.S. Armed Forces present in the country. The memorandum directs the Secretary of State to submit this certification to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
