President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 21-27, 2016, as National Safe Boating Week. The proclamation highlights the importance of practicing safe boating measures and encourages individuals to take boating safety courses, thoroughly examine their vessels, and familiarize themselves with current laws and regulations before embarking on a journey on the water. The President also emphasizes the need for wearing life jackets, avoiding drugs and alcohol while boating, and recognizing the efforts of the United States Coast Guard in protecting the nation's waterways. The proclamation is in accordance with a joint resolution approved by Congress in 1958, which designates the 7-day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as National Safe Boating Week.
