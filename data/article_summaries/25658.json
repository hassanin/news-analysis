President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018," which authorizes appropriations for the Coast Guard and the Federal Maritime Commission. However, Trump has expressed concerns about certain provisions of the Act. One provision requires advance notification to Congress before closing or reducing personnel at a Coast Guard air facility, but Trump argues that such notification should only be required for actions that are feasible and consistent with his constitutional authorities as Commander in Chief. Two other provisions require executive branch officials to recommend legislative measures to Congress, but Trump asserts his discretion to recommend only what he deems necessary and expedient. Lastly, Trump clarifies that the Federal Maritime Commission should defer to the Department of Justice regarding interpretations of antitrust laws.
