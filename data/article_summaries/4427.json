Vice President Kamala Harris and the Partnership for Central America have announced over $950 million in new private sector commitments in response to Harris' Call to Action for Northern Central America. This brings the total commitment to over $4.2 billion since May 2021. The investments aim to address the root causes of migration by creating economic opportunities in the region. The Partnership for Central America, launched with Vice President Harris, has played a crucial role in mobilizing these commitments. Around 47 companies and organizations across various sectors are collaborating to strengthen the region's economic security. The investments will create jobs, connect people to the digital economy, expand access to financing for small businesses, provide training and education for youth and workers, and improve economic livelihoods. The Call to Action is part of the U.S. government's efforts to address the root causes of migration and supports the U.S. Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration. The Call to Action focuses on six areas: promoting a reform agenda, digital and financial inclusion, food security and climate-smart agriculture, climate adaptation and clean energy, education and workforce development, and public health access. The Biden-Harris Administration welcomes additional commitments to promote economic opportunity in northern Central America and invites interested parties to visit the State Department's website or contact the State Department for more information.
