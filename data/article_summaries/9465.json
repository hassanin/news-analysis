This article is a fact sheet released by the White House Office of the Press Secretary in 2010. It discusses the U.S. government's efforts to mitigate the unauthorized disclosure of classified information by Wikileaks. The National Security Staff is coordinating an interagency effort to examine policies and practices surrounding the handling of classified information and implement safeguards to prevent future breaches. Russell Travers has been appointed as the Senior Advisor for Information Access and Security Policy to lead this effort. The President's Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB) will also review how the Executive Branch shares and protects classified information. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has directed each department and agency to establish a security assessment team to review their procedures for safeguarding classified information. The Department of State and the Department of Defense (DoD) have initiated various measures to enhance security, such as limiting access to certain databases and deploying monitoring tools. The DoD has commissioned two reviews to identify policy and technological shortfalls and is implementing recommendations, including disabling the use of removable storage media on classified networks and conducting vulnerability assessments. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is working with agencies to enhance security within the Intelligence Community, including conducting inspections, enhancing audit capabilities, reviewing removable media policies, and providing training on the handling of classified information.
