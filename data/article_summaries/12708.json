In this op-ed, President Obama discusses the need for agreement on gun reforms in light of the Tucson shooting and the ongoing issue of gun violence in America. He acknowledges the individual right to bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment and the strong tradition of gun ownership in the country. However, he emphasizes the need to prevent irresponsible individuals, such as criminals and fugitives, from obtaining guns. Obama suggests enforcing existing laws, improving the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, rewarding states with the best data, and making the system faster and more comprehensive. He calls for a new discussion on how to keep America safe from gun violence and urges both gun-control advocates and gun owners to work together towards sensible solutions.
