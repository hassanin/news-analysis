The article reports that Fadhil Ahmad al-Hayali, also known as Hajji Mutazz, the deputy leader of ISIL, was killed in a U.S. military air strike on August 18. Al-Hayali was a senior member of ISIL and played a crucial role in coordinating the movement of weapons, explosives, vehicles, and people between Iraq and Syria. He was responsible for planning operations, including the ISIL offensive in Mosul in June 2014. Al-Hayali's death is expected to have a negative impact on ISIL's operations, as his influence spanned finance, media, operations, and logistics. The United States and its coalition partners remain committed to degrading and destroying ISIL.
