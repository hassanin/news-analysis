The Biden-Harris Administration has launched an interagency initiative called the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) to address inequity in home appraisals. The task force, chaired by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge and Domestic Policy Advisor Ambassador Susan Rice, aims to tackle the disparity in housing values caused by current appraisal practices. These practices often use comparisons of properties within similar neighborhoods, which can indirectly reflect racial demographics and perpetuate the legacy of segregation and redlining. The task force will work with civil rights organizations, advocacy groups, industry, and philanthropic entities to drive change. It will deliver a final action report within 180 days.
