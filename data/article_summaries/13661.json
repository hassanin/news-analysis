The White House has released a statement criticizing the Congressional Republican budget conference agreement, which was passed by Senate Republicans. The statement highlights the underfunding of investments that benefit middle-class families and contribute to economic growth, as well as the stripping away of health insurance coverage from millions and making it harder for students to afford college. The budget also includes a temporary budget gimmick for funding national defense, while shortchanging it in later years. The statement argues that the budget proposal locks in sequestration, bringing base defense and non-defense discretionary funding to the lowest levels in a decade. The Republicans' proposed budget includes severe cuts to programs that support the middle class and provide opportunities for upward mobility. The President's Budget, on the other hand, aims to reverse sequestration and make investments in America's future, while also fulfilling the responsibility of keeping Americans safe. The President has made it clear that he will not accept a budget that locks in sequestration or reverses it for defense without also reversing it for non-defense. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress on a bipartisan agreement that will allow for investments in the economy and national security.
