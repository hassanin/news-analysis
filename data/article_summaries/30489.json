The U.S. economy added a record 4.8 million jobs in June, bringing the total to 7.5 million jobs added over the past two months. This marks the largest monthly job gains in history. The leisure and hospitality industry saw the largest gains, with 2.1 million jobs added, followed by retail trade with 740,000 jobs added. However, despite the progress, there are still 4.8 million jobs to be recovered in the leisure and hospitality industry to reach pre-COVID levels. The overall unemployment rate fell by 2.2 percentage points in June to 11.1 percent, and by 3.6 percentage points over the past two months. However, the actual progress may be understated due to misclassification of some workers as "employed" instead of "unemployed" due to temporary business closures. The unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans fell by 3.1 percentage points, while for Black Americans it fell by 1.4 percentage points. Despite the positive news, millions of Americans continue to suffer due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is still work to be done in recovering the job losses.
