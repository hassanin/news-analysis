President Barack Obama has proclaimed December 2016 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month in the United States. The proclamation highlights the dangers of driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or distractions and emphasizes the need for increased awareness and prevention. The number of traffic crash fatalities caused by impaired driving has unfortunately risen, with alcohol-related fatalities accounting for nearly one-third of all traffic deaths. The proclamation calls for collective efforts to keep roads safe, including reducing distractions as passengers, looking out for loved ones who may be drinking, and reporting dangerous driving. The administration aims to support individuals struggling with substance use disorders and improve resources for law enforcement officers. The Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over campaign encourages increased road patrols, sobriety checkpoints, and education on the dangers of impaired driving. The proclamation urges parents to set a good example for teen drivers and emphasizes the importance of responsible decision-making to prevent driving-related injuries and fatalities.
