The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to engage communities with high numbers of uninsured individuals in states across the country. The goal is to reach the remaining 10.5 million people eligible for Marketplace coverage who are still uninsured. At the end of the open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will compare the number of new Marketplace signups in participating communities to HHS estimates of the eligible uninsured population to determine which communities made the most progress. The winning community will receive a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success. Seattle is one of the 20 communities participating in the challenge. In Washington, the average monthly premium for health insurance coverage will increase by 3.9% in 2016, but tax credits can help offset the cost. In 2015, 78% of Marketplace enrollees in Washington received a tax credit, saving an average of $260 per month. There are 91,000 uninsured individuals in Seattle and the surrounding region who are eligible for the Marketplace.
