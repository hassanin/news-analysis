This article is a readout of a meeting that took place in the State Dining Room of the White House. The meeting was focused on the "My Brother's Keeper" Initiative, which aims to provide opportunities for boys and young men of color to succeed. The President expressed his belief in the American value of equal opportunity and thanked the foundation and business leaders for their commitment to this vision. The foundations have already invested $150 million, and over the next five years, they seek to invest at least $200 million, along with additional investments from peers in philanthropy and the business community. The participants in the meeting included business leaders, foundation leaders, elected officials, and administration officials.
