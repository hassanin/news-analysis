The GOP tax bill is being described as good news for middle-class Americans, as it will provide incentives for firms to invest in the United States. Currently, the federal corporate tax rate in the US is one of the highest in the world, and when state taxes are added, it becomes the highest rate among the major economic powers. This high tax rate has led American multinational firms to keep their foreign earnings offshore. The bill also includes a tax repatriation holiday, allowing firms to bring back money parked abroad and pay a tax rate of just 10%. CNBC reports that American firms have left $2.6 trillion in foreign subsidiaries, which amounts to nearly 14% of US GDP. The author argues that if firms had an incentive to reinvest this money in the US, it would lead to more American jobs.
