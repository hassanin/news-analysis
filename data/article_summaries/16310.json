The United States and Argentina have been working together to eliminate Argentina's stocks of highly enriched uranium (HEU). Over 40 kilograms of HEU have been removed from Argentina so far. Before the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit, there were still approximately 4 kilograms of HEU that could not be returned to the United States. However, Argentina was able to eliminate all of its HEU by converting its medical isotope production to the use of low-enriched uranium (LEU) targets in 2002 and converting its last reactor from HEU to LEU fuel in 2008. At the 2016 Summit, Argentina announced the successful disposition of its remaining HEU with the help of the U.S. Department of Energy and Argentina's National Atomic Energy Commission. As a result, Argentina, along with the entire Latin America and Caribbean region, is now considered free of HEU.
