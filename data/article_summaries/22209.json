President Obama signed into law the Department of State Rewards Program Update and Technical Corrections Act of 2012, which enhances the U.S. Government's ability to offer monetary rewards for information leading to the arrest or conviction of foreign nationals accused of atrocity-related crimes and individuals involved in transnational organized crime. The legislation aims to bring war criminals and other perpetrators of atrocities to justice and supports the fight against transnational organized crime, including money laundering and trafficking. This new tool will help achieve the goal of holding individuals accountable for their crimes and protecting national security.
