The Trump Administration's focus on deregulation and innovation in the energy sector has led to significant benefits for Americans. The United States has become a net exporter of petroleum and natural gas, and Texas has become the fourth-largest crude oil producer in the world. Innovations in shale production have greatly increased extraction productivity, resulting in lower prices for natural gas and electricity. These price decreases have saved US consumers $203 billion annually, with the poorest households benefiting the most. The shale revolution has also led to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, surpassing the environmental benefits projected by regulations. The energy sector has diversified and strengthened its relationship with the private sector, with increased LNG and coal exports. The Trump Administration has also supported the development of alternative uses of coal and renewable energy capacity. Despite these advancements, emissions have been falling, and the electricity sector has reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent. Overall, the Trump Administration's focus on innovation has brought positive results for consumers, businesses, and the environment.
