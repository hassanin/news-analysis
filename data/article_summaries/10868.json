The White House Campaign to Cut Waste has announced progress in eliminating excess government property. President Obama directed agencies to identify and dispose of $3 billion in excess real estate, and the campaign is on track to exceed this goal, saving $3.5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2012. A multi-million dollar property in Georgetown has been labeled as excess and will be removed from the government's books. An interactive map has been released, showing the locations of over 12,000 excess properties. The map tracks the progress of moving 1,500 additional properties to the excess list. The campaign aims to sell or dispose of unneeded properties. The properties range from abandoned sheds to office buildings, including a heating facility in Georgetown that has cost taxpayers $3.5 million in maintenance costs over the past decade. The campaign has already disposed of 1,400 properties, including a warehouse in Brooklyn that sold for $10 million and an office building in Bethesda, MD that sold for over $12 million. A new dashboard has been released to provide a detailed breakdown of each agency's contribution to the $3.5 billion real estate savings goal.
