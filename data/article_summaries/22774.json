President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Texas due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that began on May 4, 2015. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. Affected individuals in Harris, Hays, and Van Zandt counties are eligible for federal funding, which can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional counties may be designated for assistance in the future. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY). The toll-free phone numbers are available from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. local time, seven days a week.
