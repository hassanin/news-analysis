The governments of the United States, Australia, and Japan have announced progress in their commitment to addressing the infrastructure needs of the Indo-Pacific region. They have signed a Trilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to operationalize the Trilateral Partnership for Infrastructure Investment in the Indo-Pacific. The partnership aims to mobilize and support private sector investment capital for major infrastructure projects, enhance digital connectivity and energy infrastructure, and achieve mutual development goals in the region. The partnership will also work with governments in the Indo-Pacific to support infrastructure projects that adhere to international standards and principles for development. The three governments plan to promote quality infrastructure development in the lead-up to the 2019 G20 Summit in Osaka. They will consult with Indo-Pacific countries, including Papua New Guinea, to identify infrastructure projects for potential development and financing. The partnership will evaluate priority projects for joint development and financing and may send missions to work with regional governments on specific project proposals. This represents a new commitment to sustainable investment in infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific.
