President Donald Trump recently returned to Pennsylvania to share good news about the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Less than a month after the law was passed, nearly 200 companies have issued bonuses, raised minimum wages, planned investments, or donated to charity as a result of lower taxes. This includes some of the country's largest corporations. The tax reform aims to make U.S. businesses more competitive globally by lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. It also provides relief for working families through cuts on the individual side, such as doubling the child tax credit to $2,000 and repealing the Obamacare individual mandate. This is the first major overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years.
