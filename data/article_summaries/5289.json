President Biden will be traveling to areas in California that have been impacted by severe storms, including floods and landslides. He will meet with first responders, state and local officials, and affected communities to assess the damage and determine what federal support is needed. The President has been closely monitoring the situation and has already approved a major disaster declaration for California, providing federal support for debris removal, emergency measures, and individual assistance. 

The White House will also commemorate the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, with Vice President Harris delivering a major address on women's access to reproductive care and the need to protect and expand reproductive rights. The President and Vice President are committed to fighting against extreme attacks on women's healthcare and believe that women should have the right to make their own healthcare decisions without political interference. They are urging Congress to pass a national law that codifies the protections of Roe v. Wade.

In terms of the economy, the President's economic plan has been successful in rebuilding and creating jobs. The United States has seen historic job growth and a decrease in unemployment rates. However, House Republicans are pushing for an economic plan that includes tax cuts for the wealthy, higher prices for the middle class, and cuts to programs like Social Security and Medicare. The President is committed to ensuring that middle-class families are not burdened by these policies and will not allow Republicans to hold the economy hostage.

Other topics discussed in the briefing include the recent FAA issue, the reauthorization of funding for the FAA, violence against Christians in Nigeria, the situation in Ukraine, and the trial of a Polish-Belarusian activist in Belarus. The press secretary refers specific questions related to ongoing legal matters to the Department of Justice and the White House Counsel's Office.
