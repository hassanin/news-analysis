On February 23, 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the largest set of sanctions ever imposed in connection with North Korea. The action targets shipping and trade companies, vessels, and individuals involved in sanctions evasion schemes. The sanctions aim to hinder North Korea's ability to conduct evasive maritime activities that facilitate illicit coal and fuel transports, and limit the regime's ability to ship goods through international waters. The Treasury Department also issued a global shipping advisory to put everyone on notice of North Korea's illicit maritime tactics. The U.S. is committed to enforcing U.N. and U.S. sanctions as a national security imperative and will leverage its economic strength to cut off sources of revenue for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, emphasized that the U.S. is dedicated to achieving full, irreversible, and permanent denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
