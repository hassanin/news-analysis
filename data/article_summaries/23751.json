First Lady Michelle Obama joined U.S. Olympians, Paralympians, and Rio hopefuls at the US Olympic Committee’s 100 Day Countdown event in Times Square to announce nationwide commitments to get nearly two million American children active as part of her Let’s Move! initiative. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) and USOC National Governing Bodies for sport, including organizations like USA Archery, USA Basketball, and USA Gymnastics, will provide beginner athletic programming to kids throughout the next year. In addition, NBC Olympics is launching a program called Gold Map, which encourages young viewers to participate in Olympic sports in their local area. The First Lady aims to turn the inspiration of the Olympic and Paralympic Games into action by promoting healthier and more active lifestyles for children.
