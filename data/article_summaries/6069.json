Today, on Equal Pay Day, the White House and Biden Administration leaders held a meeting to discuss how President Biden's Investing in America agenda is providing economic opportunities for women in fields where they are historically underrepresented, with the goal of closing the gender pay gap. The meeting included workers, union leaders, construction contractors, heads of tradeswomen organizations, and equal pay experts. The participants discussed the pay disparities faced by women, especially women of color, and the importance of reducing barriers and creating pathways to good jobs. As part of the Investing in America agenda, the Administration announced the Department of Labor's Mega Construction Project Program, which aims to strengthen recruitment, hiring, and employment practices for construction projects funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act. The Department of Commerce also released a notice of funding opportunity for the CHIPS Incentives Program, which will support semiconductor manufacturing in the United States and require companies to provide access to child care for the workforce. The White House Women Rebuilding America roundtable brought together private employers, unions, and tradeswomen organizations to discuss strategies for recruiting and hiring women, especially women of color, in the trades. The participants emphasized the importance of creating fair and equitable workplaces and the critical role of women in advancing the Investing in America agenda.
