On July 15, 2009, President Obama released a statement praising the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee for passing a health care reform legislation. He highlighted that the proposal, similar to the House of Representatives' legislation, aimed to lower costs, improve patient care, and ensure fair treatment by insurance companies. The proposal would provide quality and affordable health care, eliminate coverage denials based on pre-existing conditions, and alleviate concerns about health insurance when changing jobs or starting a business. The legislation included a health insurance exchange that would allow families and small businesses to compare plans and choose what suits them best, including a public health insurance option to increase competition. The proposal also focused on controlling costs through preventive care, combating waste and fraud, and changing the notion that the most expensive care is the best care. President Obama urged both the House and Senate to work urgently on health reform before the August recess, commending the committee members for their leadership and progress.
