President Donald Trump has announced that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program will be phased out. The program, which was implemented by President Obama in 2012, granted work permits and benefits to around 800,000 illegal immigrants between the ages of 15 and 36. Attorney General Jeff Sessions argued that DACA was an unconstitutional exercise of executive branch discretion. Trump believes that not enforcing federal immigration law has had negative consequences for American security, including increases in crime and terrorist threats. He also stated that DACA was always meant to be temporary and that Congress now has the opportunity to pursue responsible immigration reform.
