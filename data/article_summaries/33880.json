President Donald Trump has signed into law the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2017, which aims to combat human trafficking. However, there is a constitutional concern regarding Section 502 of the Act, which requires the Department of Justice to avoid arresting or prosecuting human trafficking victims for offenses resulting from their victimization. The Trump Administration will interpret this provision in line with the executive branch's prosecutorial discretion and the President's responsibility to execute US laws faithfully.
