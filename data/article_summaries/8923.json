Today marks a significant milestone as inflation over the last six months has reached the pre-pandemic level of 2 percent. American incomes have also grown by 3.7 percent in the past year after adjusting for inflation. As the holiday season approaches, prices have decreased compared to a year ago for important items such as gas, milk, toys, appliances, electronics, car rentals, and airline fares. Many forecasters believed that it would require a spike in joblessness and a slowdown to bring inflation down, but this has not been the case. The unemployment rate has remained below 4 percent for 22 consecutive months, and wages, wealth, and employment rates are higher now than before the pandemic. This progress reflects the hard work put into fixing supply chains and increasing workforce participation. However, there is still more work to be done as prices remain high for many Americans. Efforts are being made to lower costs, including reducing the price of insulin, prescription drugs, and energy, addressing hidden fees, and urging large corporations to pass on savings to consumers. As the holidays approach, Americans can be grateful for good jobs, rising wages, a growing economy, lower costs, and the opportunity for progress in the coming year.
