The White House has announced the renaming of the Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders to the Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders in honor of Nelson Mandela. The United States also plans to double the number of annual participants in the fellowship to 1000 by 2016. The Mandela Washington Fellowship is part of the President's Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) and aims to invest in the future of Africa by providing training and networking opportunities for young African leaders. The first class of fellows arrived in June 2014 and represented all 49 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. They participated in six weeks of executive leadership training and will attend a Presidential Summit in Washington, DC. Following the summit, 100 fellows will stay in the United States for eight-week internships with NGOs, private companies, and governmental offices. The U.S. Government is also working to create ongoing professional opportunities and resources for these young leaders when they return home, including internships, mentoring, seed funding, and community development projects. U.S. embassies will provide support to ensure that fellows stay connected through alumni associations and community service activities.
