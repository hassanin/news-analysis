The Biden-Harris Administration has released its first-ever national gender strategy aimed at advancing gender equity and equality in the United States and globally. The strategy identifies ten interconnected priorities, including economic security, gender-based violence, health, education, justice and immigration, human rights and equality under the law, security and humanitarian relief, climate change, science and technology, and democracy, participation, and leadership. It adopts an intersectional approach, considering the barriers faced by those experiencing multiple forms of discrimination. The strategy aims to improve economic security, prevent and respond to gender-based violence, increase access to healthcare, and advance democracy and full participation. The implementation of this strategy will require the involvement of every White House office and executive agency. The Biden-Harris Administration has already taken steps to advance gender equity and equality through the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, and the Build Back Better Agenda. It has also taken action to address gender-based violence and improve women's health globally. The strategy emphasizes the importance of continued accountability, consultation, and engagement to achieve gender equity and equality.
