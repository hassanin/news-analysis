The White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative (CVIC) held its third national meeting, led by Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez. The CVIC is a group of 16 jurisdictions committed to using funding from the American Rescue Plan or other public sources to strengthen their community violence intervention (CVI) infrastructure. The goal is to invest in evidence-based interventions to reduce gun violence, which is a key part of President Biden's strategy. The meeting included mayors, law enforcement leaders, CVI experts, philanthropic institutions, and training and technical assistance providers. The CVIC jurisdictions have committed over $300 million to invest in public safety and CVI strategies. Rice and Rodriguez urged participants to quickly deploy these funds to expand capacity ahead of the summer months when gun crime typically increases.
