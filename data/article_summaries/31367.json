Former Senate Republican Leader Robert "Bob" Dole was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award from Congress, in a ceremony on Capitol Hill. Dole, now 94 years old, is known for his long career in politics, including his nomination as the Republican presidential nominee in 1996. However, his service to the country goes beyond politics. He served in the Army during World War II, earning multiple military honors. Dole also played a significant role in raising funds for the World War II Memorial and the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund. In 2003, he founded The Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas, which promotes political and civic participation. President Trump recognized Dole for his contribution to the World War II Memorial. Dole's example of leadership and determination serves as a role model for current leaders as the country faces important issues.
