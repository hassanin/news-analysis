On March 31, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order regarding the order of succession for the office of Attorney General. The order states that in the event that the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, or any officers designated by the Attorney General are unable to perform their duties, the United States Attorneys for the Eastern District of Virginia, Eastern District of North Carolina, and Northern District of Texas will act as and perform the functions of the Attorney General. The order also specifies that individuals serving in an acting capacity shall not act as Attorney General and that the President has the discretion to depart from this order when designating an acting Attorney General. Additionally, this order revokes Executive Order 13775 issued on February 9, 2017. The order concludes by stating that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
