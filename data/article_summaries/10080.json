President Obama has signed an emergency declaration for the state of Mississippi, authorizing federal aid to assist with the response efforts to the flooding that began on April 27, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security and FEMA will coordinate disaster relief efforts to provide assistance for emergency measures, save lives, protect property and public health, and mitigate the threat of a catastrophe in specific counties. FEMA is authorized to mobilize resources and equipment to alleviate the impacts of the emergency, with 75 percent of funding provided by the federal government. Terry L. Quarles has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area.
