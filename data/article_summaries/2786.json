The article discusses the significance of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, and the Days of Awe that follow. During this time, Jewish communities reflect on the past year, undertake an inventory of the soul, and ask important questions about personal growth, the type of nation and world they want to create. Rosh Hashanah serves as a reminder of the capacity to transform lives and begin anew, to rebuild communities through empathy, kindness, and compassion, and to seek repentance when values are not upheld. The article emphasizes the ongoing work of creation and the need to protect against the pandemic, rebuild the economy, combat antisemitism, and strengthen the bond with Israel. The author extends warm wishes for health, healing, and progress in the coming year.
