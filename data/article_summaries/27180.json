President Donald Trump has announced the official approval of the presidential permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. The pipeline, which will be built by TransCanada, is expected to span 900 miles and have the capacity to deliver over 800,000 barrels of oil per day to Gulf Coast refineries. Trump stated that the pipeline will create American jobs, lower costs for American families, and reduce dependence on foreign oil. He also emphasized the safety and reliability of pipelines compared to other forms of transportation. TransCanada's President, Russ Girling, expressed relief at the approval and stated that the project will create thousands of jobs and benefit local communities through increased tax revenues. Construction is expected to begin after necessary permits are obtained, including from the state of Nebraska.
