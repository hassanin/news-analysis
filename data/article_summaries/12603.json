The United States and Russia held their first bilateral meeting of the Working Group on Threats to and in the Use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the Context of International Security. The purpose of the meeting was to enhance confidence and promote transparency between the two countries. The meeting addressed various issues related to threats in the use of ICTs, including the implementation of confidence-building measures announced by Presidents Obama and Putin in June 2013. These measures aim to reduce tensions and promote strategic stability by facilitating real-time bilateral communication about malicious activities concerning ICTs. The working group also discussed policy issues, such as norms of state behavior, cooperation in combating ICT-related crimes, and defense issues resulting from the use of ICTs. Both countries agreed to hold regular and scheduled meetings of the working group.
