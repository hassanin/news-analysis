The article is a letter from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Peter R. Orszag to Senator Kent Conrad, Chairman of the Committee on the Budget. The letter thanks Senator Conrad for reviewing the economic recovery proposal that President Obama is working on with Congress. It mentions that the Congressional Budget Office recently released an analysis of a component of the economic recovery proposal, but that analysis did not assess the overall package. The OMB's analysis indicates that at least 75 percent of the overall package will be spent over the next year and a half. The letter also emphasizes the commitment to transparency and accountability in how the funds are spent. The letter was also sent to several other members of Congress.
