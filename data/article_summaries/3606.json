In this letter, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. informs the Speaker of the House that he has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to Hong Kong, declared in Executive Order 13936 on July 14, 2020, will continue beyond July 14, 2022. The President states that recent actions by the People's Republic of China to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
