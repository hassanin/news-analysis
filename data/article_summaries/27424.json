The article discusses the case of Maria Fuertes, a 92-year-old woman who was raped and murdered in Queens, New York. The suspect, Reeaz Khan, is an illegal immigrant from Guyana who had been previously arrested for assault. Despite a detainer request from U.S. immigration officials, Khan was released by New York City. The article argues that "sanctuary" policies, which aim to protect illegal immigrants from deportation, often result in dangerous criminals being released back into the community. Daria Ortiz, the granddaughter of the victim, joined President Trump at a White House event to advocate for legislation that would allow American victims to sue sanctuary cities for the harm caused by such policies. President Trump expressed his support for this measure and emphasized the need to prevent further tragedies caused by sanctuary cities.
