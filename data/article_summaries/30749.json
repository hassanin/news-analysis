In this op-ed, John Bolton, the U.S. National Security Adviser, discusses President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. Bolton argues that the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has failed to address Iran's aggressive and hostile behavior in the Middle East. He states that instead of using economic incentives to curb its nuclear ambitions, Iran has used billions of dollars to fund military activities in countries like Yemen and Syria, while its own people suffer from economic and environmental crises. Bolton praises President Trump for taking the time to study the deal, consult with allies, and ultimately decide that it undermines American security. He also highlights the president's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the upcoming opening of the U.S. Embassy in the city as a demonstration of the U.S.' commitment to Israel and its own national security interests. Bolton connects the withdrawal from the Iran deal to ongoing negotiations with North Korea, emphasizing the need for diplomatic solutions to address the North Korean nuclear threat. He concludes by stating that President Trump will always prioritize America's interests and take unconventional actions to achieve favorable outcomes.
