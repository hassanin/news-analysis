The statement by the White House Press Secretary condemns the Assad regime's assault on Qusayr in Syria, which has caused civilian casualties and humanitarian suffering. The statement calls for the Syrian government to allow humanitarian organizations access to evacuate the wounded and provide medical supplies. It also criticizes Hezbollah's involvement in Syria and the Syrian regime's attack on Arsal in Lebanon, stating that it violates Lebanon's sovereignty and threatens stability. The United States supports Lebanon's security and calls for Hezbollah and Iran to withdraw their fighters from Syria. The statement urges all parties to avoid actions that could further harm civilians and increase violence. The United States stands with the Syrian people in their fight for freedom and supports the moderate opposition. The statement emphasizes that Assad's refusal to step aside prolongs the suffering of the Syrian people, but assures that his reign will end and those responsible for crimes against the Syrian people will be held accountable.
