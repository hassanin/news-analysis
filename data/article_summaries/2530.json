In this memorandum, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. certifies the continuation of U.S. drug interdiction assistance to the Government of Colombia. The President declares that the interdiction of aircraft suspected of engaging in illicit drug trafficking in Colombia is necessary due to the significant threat it poses to the country's national security. Additionally, the President confirms that Colombia has appropriate procedures in place to prevent the loss of innocent lives during these interdictions, including effective methods to identify and warn aircraft before using force against them. The Secretary of State is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register and inform Congress accordingly.
