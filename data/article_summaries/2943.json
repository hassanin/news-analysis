The United States and Mexico met to discuss shared security priorities and collaborative efforts to combat fentanyl and arms trafficking. The Mexican delegation highlighted the creation of a presidential commission to fight the trafficking of illicit synthetic drugs, firearms, and ammunition. Both countries committed to dismantling the fentanyl supply chain and combating the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. They also pledged to increase cooperation in combating illegal firearms trafficking, with the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives deploying new authorities to target southbound firearms flows and increase firearms tracing. The United States and Mexico also agreed to develop a bilingual, binational public awareness prevention campaign to educate citizens, especially young people, on the dangers of synthetic drugs. A binational panel of experts will be convened to share information and best practices on substance use and overdose prevention campaigns. The meeting included representatives from various Mexican government entities and U.S. officials from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the White House, among others.
