The White House is set to release the first-ever U.S. Government Strategy on Countering Corruption. The strategy aims to combat corruption, which is a priority for the Biden-Harris administration. It focuses on understanding and addressing the transnational dimensions of corruption, reducing the ability of corrupt actors to use financial systems for money laundering, strengthening coordination with foreign governments to pursue accountability for corruption, elevating anti-corruption work as a priority across federal departments and agencies, and improving corruption-related risk analysis in foreign and security sector assistance. The Treasury Department will also release an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to address the vulnerability of the U.S. real estate market to money laundering and illicit activity. The strategy will be announced in conjunction with the Summit for Democracy, where President Biden will bring together leaders to discuss democratic renewal and address challenges such as corruption.
