In a recent Cabinet Room meeting, President Biden addressed the situation between Russia and Ukraine, stating that any Russian military movement across the Ukrainian border would be considered an invasion and met with severe economic consequences. He also highlighted the need to be prepared for other forms of Russian aggression, such as paramilitary tactics, cyberattacks, and actions by Russian soldiers not wearing uniforms. 

Shifting focus, President Biden discussed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the progress being made to modernize roads, bridges, ports, airports, rail systems, and the energy grid. He emphasized the importance of these investments in resolving supply chain issues and improving transportation efficiency. Former mayor and current team member, Mitch Landrieu, praised the administration's efforts in rebuilding America and highlighted the focus on good-paying union jobs, domestic manufacturing, equity, climate resilience, transparency, and effective implementation. The meeting concluded with a call to continue the work and move forward with the infrastructure plans.
