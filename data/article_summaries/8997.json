Jill and I are extending our warmest wishes to the Sikh community on the occasion of the 552nd anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of the Sikh faith. Guru Nanak's message of equality, peace, and service remains relevant today, just as it was five centuries ago. His teachings emphasize the importance of treating all individuals with dignity and recognizing their equal rights. Guru Nanak also championed the empowerment of women and girls, promoted interfaith cooperation, and encouraged acts of service to assist those in need. By embodying these core values, Sikhs continue to make significant contributions to communities worldwide, including in the United States.
