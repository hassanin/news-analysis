This article discusses how economists measure trade flows and clarifies the concept of balance of payments (BOP). It explains that trade is not limited to physical goods, but also includes services such as financial insurance and consulting. The BOP is a statistical statement that summarizes economic transactions between an economy and the rest of the world. It is valued using the BPM6 methodology, which focuses on balance sheet analysis and comparability with other countries. The article also explains how the BOP is constructed, starting from the customs value of imports and exports, and includes adjustments to align trade data with national income accounts. The trade balance is obtained by subtracting imports from exports, and it can be calculated for goods, services, or both. The article highlights that BOP accounting can vary slightly across countries, leading to differences in reported values of surpluses and deficits. It provides an example of U.S. bilateral trade balances with Canada to illustrate these concepts.
