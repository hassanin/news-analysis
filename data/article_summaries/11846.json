President Obama will highlight innovative non-profit programs that are making a difference in communities across the country. These programs, such as Harlem Children's Zone, Teach for America, HopeLab, Genesys Works, and Bonnie CLAC, have developed models that are demonstrating results in education, training, healthcare, and other areas. The President is calling on foundations, philanthropists, and the private sector to partner with the government to invest in these innovative, high-impact solutions. He believes that cross-sector partnerships are crucial to transforming schools, improving the health of Americans, and creating more jobs in clean energy and emerging industries. The President has tasked the White House Domestic Policy Council's innovation team to search for effective programs that can transform communities and change lives.
