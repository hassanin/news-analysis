According to an article by Jeff Cox on CNBC, the unemployment rate in the United States is currently at 3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969. Wages and salaries also saw a significant increase, rising by 0.9 percent, surpassing expectations of 0.5 percent. On a yearly basis, wages and salaries jumped by 3.1 percent, marking the largest increase in 10 years. This rise in wages has been a missing factor in the economy since the recovery from the 2008 recession, but with the unemployment rate at a historic low, wage pressures are starting to build. The article also mentions that private payroll growth in October exceeded expectations, leading to an increase in Treasury yields.
