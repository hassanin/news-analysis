The forest industry contributes nearly $300 billion to the US Gross Domestic Product and employs almost one million Americans. The Trump Administration is taking steps to strengthen the market for wood products and encourage innovative manufacturing techniques. In 2019, the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service sold 3.3 billion board feet of timber from National Forests, the highest output since 1997. The administration is also focused on promoting forest health and reducing wildfire risk through science-based forest management practices. The recent wildfires in the western US and the economic losses caused by Hurricane Laura highlight the need to protect the timber industry and maintain a domestic supply of timber. The administration has also joined the World Economic Forum's One Trillion Trees initiative to promote forest conservation and growth. The president has signed an executive order to establish the United States One Trillion Trees Interagency Council to further the government's participation in this effort. Additionally, the president has called for the passage of the REPLANT Act to address reforestation needs. National Forest Products Week, designated by Congress, is observed from October 18 to October 24, 2020, to recognize the economic importance of forest products and reaffirm the commitment to the nation's forests.
