On July 29, 2021, the President signed two bills into law. The first one, S. 957, requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish specific periods of time for the public disposal of controlled substances medications at certain VA facilities. The second one, S. 1910, known as the "Major Medical Facility Authorization Act of 2021," authorizes the construction of various major medical facilities for the VA and provides appropriations for those projects. The President expressed gratitude to Senators John Kennedy and Mike Braun, as well as Representatives Vern Buchanan, Susie Lee, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, David Trone, and Tom Rice for their leadership on S. 957. Similarly, the President thanked Senators Jerry Moran and Jon Tester, along with Representatives Colin Allred, Derek Kilmer, Mike Levin, Kim Schrier, and Marilyn Strickland for their leadership on S. 1910.
