The article discusses an executive order signed by President Barack Obama to strengthen protections against trafficking in persons in federal contracts. The order aims to prevent the use of trafficked labor and promote compliance with anti-trafficking laws in government procurement. It requires the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to strengthen the zero-tolerance policy on trafficking in persons by federal contractors and subcontractors. The order also establishes requirements for contractors and subcontractors to maintain a compliance plan, cooperate with audits and investigations, and certify their commitment to preventing trafficking-related activities. Additionally, it calls for the evaluation and identification of industries or sectors with a history of trafficking-related or forced labor activities in federal contracts performed within the United States. The order also emphasizes the need for guidance and training to improve monitoring and compliance with anti-trafficking actions. The executive order became effective immediately and applies to solicitations issued on or after its effective date.
