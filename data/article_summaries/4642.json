First Lady Jill Biden and U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona are embarking on a multi-state summer learning tour to highlight the importance of summer programs in student recovery and success. President Biden has invested significantly in expanding summer programs for students and families across the nation through the American Rescue Plan (ARP). This plan provided $122 billion to help schools reopen and support students academically and mentally, including funding for summer learning and enrichment programs. All 50 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico are investing in summer programs to benefit students, especially those disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The Biden-Harris Administration is calling on schools to use ARP funds to provide high-quality summer learning programs, tutoring, and afterschool programs to support an additional four months of learning gains in reading and math. The First Lady and Secretary Cardona will visit summer learning programs in Connecticut, Michigan, and Georgia, which have received a significant amount of ARP funding for academic recovery. The tour is part of the Administration's commitment to addressing lost instructional time and providing students with the necessary mental health supports. Additionally, the Administration launched a national strategy to mobilize tutors and mentors to support students' academic needs, and individuals can sign up to volunteer or seek help in improving programs through the Partnership for Student Success website.
