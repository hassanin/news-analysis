The article discusses the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was recently passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump. According to the author, Senator Chuck Grassley, this legislation reforms the tax code, simplifies filing, and provides tax relief to middle-class families and low-income earners. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cuts tax rates across the board and allows families to have more control over their own money. For example, a typical Iowa family of four making $59,000 annually could see a tax cut of nearly $1,700. The author argues that this tax reform is an investment in America's economic health and prosperity, encourages job creation and higher wages, and lightens the financial burden on current taxpayers. The article concludes by giving credit to President Trump for keeping his promise to reform the tax code and stating that the tax relief will start to be seen in people's paychecks in February.
