The Vice President has made a statement regarding the launch of the latest version of Recovery.gov. He states that this launch is a significant step towards providing transparency and accountability for the spending of Recovery Act dollars. The website now includes agency-level information, interactive maps, graphs, and other user-friendly features. In the future, data will also be posted directly from recipients to show how they have used Recovery dollars on projects nationwide. The Vice President commends the work of Earl Devaney and his team at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board for leveraging technology to provide the public with more information about their taxpayer dollars than ever before. He expresses his excitement for the continued growth of Recovery.gov alongside the Recovery Act.
