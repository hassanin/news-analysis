The White House is pleased with the agreement reached by House and Senate leadership to fund the government for the first quarter of 2013. The President has emphasized the importance of adhering to the funding levels agreed upon by both parties last year, without including any ideological or extraneous policy riders. The President will work with leaders from both parties to sign a bill that meets these goals.
