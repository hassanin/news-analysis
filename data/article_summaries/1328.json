The announcement today demonstrates global condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and efforts to address the impact of President Putin's actions. President Biden has emphasized the use of all available tools to protect American businesses and consumers, including addressing rising fuel prices. After extensive coordination and consultation, the International Energy Agency (IEA) member countries, with the support of the European Commission, have agreed to release 60 million barrels of crude oil from strategic petroleum reserves. President Biden will authorize the release of 30 million barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The IEA member countries will continue to monitor markets and consider further releases if necessary. Additionally, efforts to diversify energy supplies away from Russia and counter Moscow's weaponization of oil and gas will continue.
