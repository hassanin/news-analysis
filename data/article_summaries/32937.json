President Trump delivered remarks on May 16, 2019, on modernizing the immigration system in the United States. He outlined a plan that focuses on border security, stopping illegal immigration, and creating a new legal immigration system that prioritizes American workers and promotes American values. The plan includes measures to secure the border, close loopholes in the asylum system, and expedite relief for legitimate asylum seekers. It also aims to increase the proportion of highly skilled immigrants and establish a points-based selection system similar to Canada. Additionally, the plan emphasizes the importance of learning English and passing a civics exam as requirements for future immigrants. Trump expressed the need for bipartisan support and suggested that if the plan doesn't get approved before the election, it will be passed afterwards.
