The President released a statement expressing his disappointment with the lack of progress on immigration reform in the House of Representatives. He highlighted the bipartisan effort in the Senate to pass comprehensive legislation that would fix the broken immigration system. The Senate's bill aimed to grow the economy, reduce the deficit, provide a pathway to earned citizenship for undocumented individuals, modernize the legal immigration system, strengthen border security, and hold employers accountable. However, House Republicans have repeatedly failed to take action and have instead voted in favor of extreme measures. The President emphasized that there is broad support for immigration reform among Americans, including Democrats and Republicans, labor and business, and faith and law enforcement leaders. He urged House Republicans to listen to the will of the American people and bring immigration reform to the House floor for a vote.
