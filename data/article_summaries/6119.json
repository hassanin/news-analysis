The White House National Monkeypox Response team has announced new measures to combat the monkeypox outbreak and protect high-risk individuals. The Biden-Harris Administration is providing additional vaccines and support to states and cities hosting events that attract large numbers of LGBTQI+ individuals, particularly gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. The Administration is also implementing a pilot program to increase vaccine availability and prevention resources in communities of color, as recent CDC data shows the virus disproportionately affects Black and Latino gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.

The White House is providing extra vaccines and support to Louisiana, Georgia, and California ahead of events that draw large numbers of LGBTQI+ individuals. For Southern Decadence in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Administration is supplying up to 6,000 additional vaccine doses and supporting 12 community vaccination events. In Atlanta, Georgia, for Atlanta Black Pride, up to 5,500 extra doses will be provided, and routine vaccination clinics and 12 additional vaccination events will be held. Oakland, California, will receive an additional 2,400 doses for Oakland Pride and Pridefest events.

Additionally, the White House announced a new equity intervention pilot program to ensure vaccines reach communities most affected by the outbreak. The program will set aside 10,000 vials of vaccine for smaller-scale interventions that target populations facing barriers to access, such as lack of online appointment scheduling or stigma associated with disclosing sexual or gender identity. The Administration will provide a toolkit to guide equity intervention strategies, and jurisdictions can request supply by engaging with the CDC.

Overall, these actions aim to address the monkeypox outbreak and protect vulnerable communities by increasing vaccine availability, providing support, and implementing targeted interventions.
