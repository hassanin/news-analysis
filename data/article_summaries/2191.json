During a press briefing, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese provided additional background on President Biden's actions to respond to Putin's price hike and increase the supply of oil. Deese explained that the President authorized the largest release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in American history, with 1 million barrels a day for six months. He emphasized that the release is unprecedented in scale and duration and is designed to bridge the gap until U.S. production comes back online. Deese also mentioned that there is significant demand in the market and that the President authorized the sale and repurchase of oil at a lower price to provide stability and increase the resilience of the SPR. Additionally, Deese discussed the President's directive to use the Defense Production Act to prioritize and subsidize the production of critical materials for large-capacity batteries, which is aimed at achieving energy independence and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
