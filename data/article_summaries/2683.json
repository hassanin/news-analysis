Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at the CEO Summit in Los Angeles, emphasizing the importance of building a prosperous and inclusive future for the Western Hemisphere. She highlighted the intertwined economies of the region and the impact of strong ties on the American people. Harris stressed the need for public-private partnerships to unleash growth and opportunity. She presented a scenario of how collaboration between governments and companies could uplift a single mother in Honduras, offering her a job, access to education, financial services, and internet connectivity, leading to entrepreneurship and economic growth. Harris discussed the Root Causes Strategy to address migration from Central America, focusing on principles such as addressing basic needs, partnering with the private sector, and combating corruption and promoting the rule of law. She highlighted the progress made through the Call to Action initiative, generating over $3.2 billion in investment and creating jobs, expanding banking services, and connecting people to the internet. Harris emphasized the importance of training, protecting, and empowering women and addressing gender-based violence. She described the Call to Action as an innovative model of public-private partnership, bringing together various sectors and creating an ecosystem of opportunity. Harris called for replication of this approach in other regions and highlighted the need for new coalitions between the public and private sectors to address economic inequality, barriers faced by women and girls, pandemic recovery, climate crisis, corruption, migration, and democratic backsliding. She urged leaders to consider partnering in areas such as clean energy, food security, health, supply chains, and infrastructure. Harris concluded by emphasizing the power of partnership in solving pressing challenges and creating new opportunities for individuals, companies, and the hemisphere as a whole.
