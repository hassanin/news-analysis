President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring the week of August 7 to August 13, 2016, as National Health Center Week. The proclamation highlights the important role that community health centers play in providing affordable and high-quality healthcare to underserved communities and vulnerable populations. These centers focus on community-based and patient-centered care, emphasizing education and prevention to promote wellness and help people lead healthier lives. The Affordable Care Act has enabled health centers to expand their services and provide care for nearly 23 million patients. The Obama administration has invested in health centers to support their efforts in treating substance use disorders, expanding oral health services, and addressing public health challenges such as the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and the Zika virus threat. The proclamation encourages Americans to celebrate National Health Center Week by visiting their local health centers and exploring the programs they offer.
