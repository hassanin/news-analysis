The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis has released data showing that the country's GDP grew by 7.4% (33.1% annualized) in the third quarter of 2020, which is the largest single quarter of economic growth on record. This growth follows the severe contraction caused by the pandemic in the second quarter. The United States has now recovered two-thirds of the economic output lost due to the pandemic during the first half of the year. Consumer spending, particularly in the services sector, played a significant role in driving this growth. The government's stimulus efforts, including the CARES Act, also contributed to the recovery. The strong foundation of the pre-pandemic economy and the effectiveness of the Trump Administration's economic aid measures have helped deliver this record-setting growth. The article concludes that the U.S. economy is expected to continue expanding in the fourth quarter.
