The Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new commitments from public and private sectors to promote electric vehicles (EVs), save taxpayer money, and address climate change. The Federal Government will release new employee travel guidelines that prioritize sustainable transportation for official and local travel. These commitments aim to increase the use of EVs and clean transportation infrastructure, boost American manufacturing, and create jobs. The State of California, companies, and nonprofits are also joining the EV Acceleration Challenge to expand EV fleets and charging infrastructure. Leading organizations in the travel and hospitality sector, rental car and rideshare companies, and other industries are making commitments to support clean transportation. For example, American Express Global Business Travel is launching a software solution that prioritizes EVs over gasoline cars, Amtrak is transitioning its fleet to zero emissions by 2035, and Marriott International is doubling the number of hotels and EV chargers for guests by 2027. Other commitments include expanding EV availability at rental locations, increasing EV rentals for corporate travelers, and deploying more charging points at high-demand locations. These commitments align with President Biden's goal of having at least 50% of new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. The EV Acceleration Challenge is ongoing, and more commitments will be highlighted in the future.
