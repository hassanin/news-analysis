In a press conference, President Biden thanked the House committees for their work on advancing components of his economic plan. He expressed confidence that Congress will deliver both the bipartisan physical infrastructure plan and the Build Back Better plan. He stated that America is at an inflection point and facing a choice between an economy that benefits big corporations and the wealthy or one that invests in the nation and benefits everyone, including working people and the middle class. He highlighted the growing wealth disparity and the need for the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share of taxes. He also discussed the progress of the economy, the importance of getting COVID-19 under control, and his plan to tackle inflation, childcare, healthcare, climate change, and extreme weather events. He emphasized that his plan is fiscally responsible, paid for by making corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share, and will benefit the middle class. He criticized the opposition's defense of tax breaks for the wealthy and called for building back better and not just rebuilding what was lost.
