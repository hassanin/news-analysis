In this letter, President Barack Obama reports that he has issued an Executive Order expanding the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, with respect to the situation in Ukraine. The order is issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and states that the actions and policies of the Russian government, including the deployment of military forces in Crimea, undermine democratic processes in Ukraine and pose a threat to its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The order blocks the property and interests in property of individuals listed in an Annex to the order, as well as individuals determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to be connected to the Russian government or to have provided support to it. Additionally, the order suspends entry into the United States for any alien who meets the specified criteria. The President has delegated authority to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take necessary actions to carry out the order. All US government agencies are directed to implement the provisions of the order.
