The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) strongly condemn Russia's use of sham referenda to justify changing the status of Ukrainian sovereign territory. These actions violate the United Nations Charter and international law and go against the rule of law between nations. The referenda organized by Russia have no legal effect or legitimacy as they do not respect democratic norms and involve intimidation of local populations. The G7 will never recognize these referenda, which are seen as a step towards Russian annexation. The G7 also criticizes Russia for escalating tensions, including mobilizing reservists and making irresponsible nuclear threats. The G7 calls on all countries to reject these sham referenda and stands ready to impose further economic costs on Russia and those supporting its illegal actions. The G7 remains committed to supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and will provide financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic, and legal support. Reconstruction efforts will also be pursued, including through an international conference in Berlin. The G7 will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as necessary.
