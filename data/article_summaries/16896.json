President Obama has designated three new national monuments in the California desert, protecting nearly 1.8 million acres of public lands. This brings the total number of acres of public lands protected as national monuments by President Obama to 265 million, more than any administration in history. The President will be flying over some of these designated lands during the flight. The President will also speak at the Toner Prize dinner in Washington, D.C. on March 28th, honoring excellence in political reporting. The President is deeply looking forward to this event. The administration is deeply concerned about North Korea's recent actions and will not oppose the North Korea sanctions bill that cleared Congress. The administration has agreed to implement a nationwide cessation of hostilities in Syria to begin in a week. The administration is working with partners in the region to make sure that all parties are prepared to honor their commitments. The President has not met with any donors or Hollywood producers during his stay in Los Angeles. The White House has no reason to believe the reports that an unnamed Republican from the United States requested that Iran delay the release of Americans until after the election. The White House cannot confirm reports that Russia was behind the cyber-attack on Ukraine's power grid. The President is deeply engaged in the Syria agreement and has directed Secretary Kerry to be the primary negotiator. The week ahead includes a summit with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, meetings at the White House, honoring the Chicago Blackhawks for their Stanley Cup victory, and meeting with Democratic governors.
