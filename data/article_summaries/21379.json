On March 18th, 2014, President Barack Obama awarded 24 Army veterans the Medal of Honor for their bravery during major combat operations in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. These veterans had previously received the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second highest military award, and their awards were upgraded to the Medal of Honor. The award ceremony was open press, but space was limited. The recipients included Specialist Four Santiago J. Erevia, Staff Sergeant Melvin Morris, and Sergeant First Class Jose Rodela, among others. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who have shown exceptional bravery and valor in combat situations.
