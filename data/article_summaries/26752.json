President Donald Trump has proclaimed June 2019 as National Ocean Month in the United States. In the proclamation, he highlights the importance of the ocean to the country's economy, national security, and environment. The ocean supports millions of American jobs in various industries such as fishing, tourism, international trade, shipping, ports, and energy. The United States has the largest exclusive economic zone in the world, with over 13,000 miles of coastline and 3.4 million nautical square miles of ocean within its territorial jurisdiction. The oceans and Great Lakes generate $320 billion in economic activity. The Trump Administration is committed to protecting aquatic species, reducing reliance on foreign fish imports, and supporting the fishery industry. Efforts have been made to advance ocean-related scientific research, engage federal agencies with state-led regional ocean partnerships, and make ocean-related information publicly available. The Administration aims to conserve, manage, and balance America's use of the ocean through enhanced mapping and exploration, leveraging resources and expertise from the private sector. The proclamation calls upon Americans to reflect on the value and importance of the ocean to the country's security, environment, economy, and personal enjoyment.
