The White House expresses shock and offers condolences to those who lost loved ones in the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17. They are seeking information on whether any Americans were on board and are calling for a full, credible, and unimpeded international investigation. They urge Russia, pro-Russian separatists, and Ukraine to support an immediate cease-fire to ensure safe access to the crash site for investigators and facilitate the recovery of remains. International organizations like the United Nations and OSCE may play a role in this effort. The United States is prepared to provide assistance to the investigation through resources from the NTSB and FBI. The incident occurred in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, fueled by Russian support for separatists. The United States urges Russia to take concrete steps to de-escalate the situation and support a sustainable cease-fire and path toward peace proposed by the Ukrainian government.
