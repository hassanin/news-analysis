The United States strongly condemns the bombing of civilian populations by the Sudanese Armed Forces in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States in Sudan. Such attacks are a violation of international law and worsen the ongoing crisis in these areas. The lack of humanitarian access in these states is causing immense human suffering, death, and displacement. The United States urges the Sudanese government to grant immediate and unconditional humanitarian access to those in need. If humanitarian access is not granted by March, the situation will reach a critical stage just short of full-scale famine. The United States believes that dialogue, not violence, is the only way to resolve this conflict and encourages all parties to negotiate a peaceful settlement.
