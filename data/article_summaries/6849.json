The article discusses the importance of the Columbia River and its tributaries, wetlands, and estuaries in the Pacific Northwest. These water bodies provide various benefits such as water supply, power generation, recreation, agriculture, transportation, and natural resources. The native fish populations, particularly salmon and steelhead, play a crucial role in the culture, economy, and way of life of Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples in the region. However, the construction and operation of dams in the Basin have significantly depleted fish populations, with many species now listed as threatened or endangered. Despite efforts to restore these populations, they continue to decline. The article emphasizes the need for a sustained national effort to restore healthy and abundant native fish populations in the Basin.

To address these issues, President Biden has ordered federal agencies to prioritize honoring trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal Nations affected by the dams in the Columbia River System. The policy aims to work with Congress, Tribal Nations, states, local governments, and stakeholders to find effective solutions for restoring fish populations, ensuring clean energy, supporting local agriculture, and investing in communities dependent on the Basin's dams. Federal agencies are directed to review their programs and identify steps necessary to advance the policy. An intergovernmental partnership will also be developed to involve relevant parties in pursuing the goals outlined in the policy. The memorandum concludes by stating that it should not impede agency requirements or create additional obligations, and it encourages independent agencies to comply.
