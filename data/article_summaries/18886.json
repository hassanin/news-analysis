The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to engage communities with high numbers of uninsured individuals. The goal is to help these communities reach and enroll those who are eligible for marketplace coverage under the Affordable Care Act. At the end of the enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of new signups in each participating community to the estimated number of eligible uninsured individuals to determine the most successful community. The winning community will receive recognition and a visit from President Obama. In Louisiana, 85% of people can find a health insurance plan for $100 or less, and tax credits are available to eligible individuals and families. Despite progress, there is still work to be done to cover the uninsured, particularly in New Orleans where there are 98,000 eligible uninsured individuals. The other communities participating in the challenge are Dallas, Tampa, Atlanta, Seattle, Great Falls, Salt Lake City, Kansas City, Chicago, Phoenix, Detroit, Charlotte, Nashville, Denver, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Oakland, Richmond, and Long Beach.
