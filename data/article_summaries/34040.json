On August 16, 2017, the President signed two laws related to veterans. The first law, H.R. 2210, designates a community living center in Pennsylvania as the Sergeant Joseph George Kusick VA Community Living Center. The second law, H.R. 3218, is called the "Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017." This law amends various authorities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill, other educational programs, administration of educational programs, Reserve Component benefits, and miscellaneous provisions.
