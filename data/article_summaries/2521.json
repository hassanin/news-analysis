The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new enforcement measures to increase security at the border and reduce unlawful migration. These measures will expand legal pathways for orderly migration and impose consequences for those who attempt to enter unlawfully. The administration will also allocate additional resources to the border and the region, enhance anti-smuggling operations, and provide support for border cities and non-governmental organizations. These actions are being implemented in partnership with Mexico and governments in the Western Hemisphere. However, these steps will not solve all the problems in the broken immigration system, and comprehensive immigration reform and border security measures proposed by President Biden on his first day in office are being blocked by Republicans in Congress. The administration plans to impose new consequences for individuals who attempt to enter unlawfully and expand legal pathways for safe and orderly migration. They will also surge resources to secure the border, disrupt criminal smuggling networks, and support border communities. However, the administration emphasizes that without the funding and comprehensive immigration reform measures requested from Congress, the broken immigration system will remain broken.
