The article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on June 5, 2013. The memorandum is addressed to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Energy. It is related to a determination made by the President pursuant to Section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. 

The President states that after considering various factors, including a report submitted by the Energy Information Administration on April 25, 2013, global economic conditions, increased oil production by certain countries, and the level of spare capacity, he has determined that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. This determination allows for a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions.

The President emphasizes that he will closely monitor the situation to ensure that the market can continue to accommodate the reduction in purchases from Iran. He authorizes and directs the Secretary of State to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
