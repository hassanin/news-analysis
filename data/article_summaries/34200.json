Today, we celebrate the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery in the United States. This landmark moment in history marked the end of an oppressive institution and signaled a new era in American society. We remember the millions of souls who suffered under slavery and reaffirm our commitment to the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all people. African Americans have made significant contributions to our country, fueling its success and fulfilling its core values. The 13th Amendment ended the division between slave states and free states, bringing us closer to the truth of equality for all. We honor the sacrifices made by those who fought for equality and strive to strengthen the bonds of unity among all Americans. In remembrance of those who endured slavery, we will continue to fight against hate and injustice to secure a better future for future generations. The United States is the greatest country in the world because of its constant progress towards equality and justice. We recommit to building on this progress and working towards a freer and brighter future for all.
