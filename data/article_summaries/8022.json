The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Office of Public Engagement recently hosted a "Communities in Action" event in New York. The event brought together local elected officials, community leaders, labor leaders, business owners, and healthcare professionals to discuss the impact of the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and Inflation Reduction Act on communities in New York. Senior Biden-Harris Administration officials, including Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough and Deputy Transportation Secretary Polly Trottenberg, highlighted the progress being made and the opportunities being created for working families through these investments. This event was part of a series of forums held by the White House to showcase the administration's achievements and collaboration with state and local leaders.
