President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring June 15, 2016, as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. The proclamation acknowledges that elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation are serious issues that threaten the livelihoods of older individuals. It states that one in ten seniors in America experiences mistreatment or abuse, including domestic and sexual violence, but many incidents go unreported. The proclamation calls for renewed commitment to combat and raise awareness of elder abuse, and to ensure security and dignity for all seniors. It highlights that elder abuse can take different forms, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as well as theft, fraud, and financial exploitation. The administration is dedicated to addressing this problem by providing care to survivors of abuse, transforming the criminal justice system to better understand elder abuse, and increasing public awareness of warning signs and prevention strategies. Additionally, efforts are being made to support women domestically and abroad and combat gender-based violence. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of how a country treats its older citizens and highlights the administration's commitment to strengthening programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, the Older Americans Act, and Social Security. It mentions the Elder Justice Act and the Violence Against Women Act as important legislation that address elder abuse and support survivors. The proclamation also mentions the White House Conference on Aging, which took place last year and focused on improving the quality of life for older Americans. The proclamation concludes by urging everyone to give people the tools and support they need to live their golden years in peace and security, and to fight against cruelty towards seniors.
