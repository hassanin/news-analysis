The Obama Administration has announced that federal employee benefits, such as healthcare and retirement benefits, will now be available to eligible married gay and lesbian couples and their families. This decision is in line with the recent Supreme Court ruling that all married couples, regardless of sexual orientation, should be treated equally under federal law. The administration acknowledges the contributions of thousands of gays and lesbians serving in the federal government and believes that they and their families should receive the same respect and protection as any other family. Attorney General Holder will be leading the efforts to fully implement the Court's decision.
