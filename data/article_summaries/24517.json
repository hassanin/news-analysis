This article is a Presidential Proclamation issued by President Barack Obama on August 31, 2009. The proclamation is about adjusting the rules of origin under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and making technical corrections to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to reflect amendments to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure the continuation of duty reductions for goods from Mexico under NAFTA and to maintain reciprocal concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel. The modifications to the HTS set forth in the proclamation will take effect on October 1, 2009.
