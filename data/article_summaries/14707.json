Press Secretary Jay Carney gave a briefing on October 4, 2013, discussing various topics including Tropical Storm Karen, the effects of the government shutdown, and the President's decision to cancel his Asia trip. Carney emphasized the negative consequences of the shutdown on the government's missions and workers, and called on Speaker of the House John Boehner to bring up the Senate-passed funding bill for a vote. He also mentioned the impact of the shutdown on the Office of Foreign Asset Control and the need to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default. Carney stated that the President is willing to negotiate on broader budget challenges but only after the government is reopened and the debt ceiling is raised. He also highlighted the high level of interest in the Affordable Care Act and provided anecdotes of individuals who have successfully enrolled in health insurance plans through the online exchanges. Carney did not provide specific enrollment figures but stated that the enrollment period is six months and that early enrollment is typically characterized by comparison-shopping.
