The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law by President Trump six months ago is having a positive impact on small businesses in the United States. Mike Zaffaroni, the owner of Liberty Landscape Supply in Jacksonville, Florida, used the tax cuts as motivation to purchase an $80,000 truck and forklift for his company. Under the new tax law, Zaffaroni will be able to write off the entire cost of the purchase this year and estimates he will save 7-10% on his taxes. He plans to reinvest the savings into his business by expanding his services, adding a product line, and hiring more employees. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allows most small businesses to deduct 20% off their business income and have their taxable income taxed at lower rates. It also allows them to write off investments in new equipment in the year the investment is made. The positive effects of the tax cuts can be seen in the low unemployment rate, increased wages, and growing optimism among small business owners.
