This article is a briefing by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Secretary of Health & Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. Sebelius discusses the need for medical malpractice reform and announces that $25 million in grants will be made available to states, localities, and health systems for demonstration projects focused on patient safety and medical liability. The projects will aim to reduce preventable injuries, improve communication between doctors and patients, ensure fair compensation for medical injuries, and reduce liability premiums. The grants will be available for planning and implementation of projects, and the results will be used to inform future health care policies.
