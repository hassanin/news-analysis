In a recent meeting, President Biden expressed gratitude for the tentative agreement reached at the West Coast ports, emphasizing the importance of collective bargaining. He thanked Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su for her leadership during the negotiations. The President also highlighted the fight against junk fees, which are hidden charges that companies add to bills, making it difficult for families to pay their expenses. The administration has taken steps to crack down on these fees, including reducing overdrafts and bounced check costs. President Biden announced further progress in addressing junk fees, specifically in the area of all-in pricing, where companies disclose all fees upfront when customers start shopping. Companies such as Live Nation, SeatGeek, and xBk have committed to adopting all-in pricing. The President called on competitors in various industries to follow suit. He emphasized that this crackdown on junk fees is beneficial for consumers and is part of a larger effort to address issues in the online ticketing industry and eliminate junk fees across all sectors. The President also briefly addressed questions about Secretary of State Antony Blinken's goals in China and a cyberattack, dismissing a question about a reference to him in a Ukraine and FBI informant file.
