On February 15, 2014, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, S. 25, extends the current-law sequestration of certain Federal direct spending for another fiscal year. It also repeals a reduction in annual cost-of-living adjustments to military pensions for current military members and retirees. Additionally, it establishes a $2.3 billion transitional fund for Medicare payments for physicians services in 2017. 

The second bill, S. 540, is called the "Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act." This bill temporarily suspends the public debt limit until March 15, 2015.
