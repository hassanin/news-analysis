The article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney, aboard Air Force One. Carney discusses the importance of Congress not allowing interest rates to double for student loans and the need for bipartisan action on this issue. He also addresses the debate on how to pay for the extension of student loan rates and welcomes any support for preventing the rates from doubling. Carney mentions that Republican support, including from Mitt Romney, is welcome, but notes that the Republican budget does not include provisions to prevent the doubling of interest rates and cuts programs that are essential for young Americans to get the education they need. He also mentions that the White House is discussing various pay-for options, including closing the loophole for S corporations. Carney responds to criticisms from Republicans about the lack of jobs for college graduates, pointing out the positive economic growth and job creation under the Obama administration. He also briefly addresses questions about the White House Counsel's inquiry into the Cartagena scandal and condemns Sudan's military incursion into South Sudan. Carney suggests that North Korea refrain from engaging in more hostile or provocative actions. The press gaggle ends with Carney addressing questions about the President's position on civil unions and the report on Social Security and Medicare.
