The White House and the U.S. Department of Education have announced the six finalists for the 2011 Race to the Top High School Commencement Challenge. The challenge invited public high schools to demonstrate their commitment to preparing students for college and a career. The six finalists were selected for their creativity in engaging and supporting students, academic results, and progress in preparing students for college and career readiness. The next phase of the challenge will involve the Get Schooled Foundation working with each school to produce a video for online voting. The public will have the opportunity to vote for the three schools they think best meet the President's goal of having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. The President will then select a national winner from these three finalists and deliver the commencement address at the winning high school.
