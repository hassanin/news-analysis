Presidential Determination No. 2022-25 outlines the refugee admissions plan for Fiscal Year 2023 in the United States. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. authorizes the admission of up to 125,000 refugees based on humanitarian concerns or national interest. The admissions will be allocated among different regions as follows: 40,000 for Africa, 15,000 for East Asia, 15,000 for Europe and Central Asia, 15,000 for Latin America/Caribbean, and 35,000 for Near East/South Asia. An additional 5,000 unallocated refugee numbers can be used as needed. The Secretary of State is authorized to allocate these numbers to regions requiring additional admissions. Unused admissions allocated to a specific region can be transferred to other regions if necessary. The President determines that providing assistance to persons applying for admission as part of the overseas refugee admissions program contributes to the foreign policy interests of the United States. The President also designates specific groups, including persons in Cuba, Eurasia and the Baltics, Iraq, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and persons identified by a U.S. Embassy, as refugees for admission to the United States within their countries of nationality or habitual residence. The directive concludes by authorizing the publication of this determination in the Federal Register.
