President Obama sent warm wishes to those celebrating Passover in America, Israel, and around the world. He reflected on his recent visit to Israel and emphasized the unbreakable bonds between the two countries. Passover is a holiday that celebrates the freedom our ancestors fought for, but it also reminds us of our responsibility to look to the future and continue working towards repairing the world. The President expressed hope that we can draw upon the best in ourselves to meet the challenges that lie ahead.
