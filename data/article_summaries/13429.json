On April 1, 2014, President Obama signed H.R. 4302, also known as the "Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014." This law prevents cuts to Medicare physician payments that were scheduled to take effect on the same day. It also extends other health-related provisions that were set to expire and makes additional changes to current healthcare laws.
