This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama, declaring the establishment of the Fort Monroe National Monument. The proclamation highlights the historical significance of Fort Monroe, which was known as "The Gibraltar of the Chesapeake" and "Freedom's Fortress." The fort played a major role in the defense of the Chesapeake Bay and was a stronghold of the Union Army during the Civil War. It also served as a place of refuge for those escaping enslavement and was the imprisonment site of Chief Blackhawk and Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The proclamation designates approximately 325.21 acres of land as the Fort Monroe National Monument, to be managed by the Secretary of the Interior through the National Park Service. The Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior will enter into a memorandum of agreement to transfer administrative jurisdiction over the monument's lands. The proclamation also calls for the preparation of a management plan to preserve and enhance the monument and provide recreational opportunities. The establishment of the monument is subject to valid existing rights, and the Commonwealth of Virginia has agreed to relinquish reversionary rights to the United States. The proclamation emphasizes that the responsibilities of the Department of the Army under environmental laws and its authority over public access and environmental remediation are not affected.
