President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations, which was declared in Executive Order 13581 in 2011, will continue beyond July 24, 2017. The President emphasizes that these criminal organizations pose a threat to the safety of the United States and its citizens due to their illegal activities and disregard for human life. They also contribute to violent conflicts and enable the actions of other dangerous individuals. The President believes that the activities of these organizations still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
