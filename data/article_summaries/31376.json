President Trump has signed the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act into law. However, the President has expressed concerns about certain provisions of the Act. Specifically, sections of the Act that require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to submit budget requests to Congress and evaluate if additional legislative authority or appropriations are needed. The President believes that these provisions infringe upon his constitutional authority to recommend measures to Congress. As a result, the President has stated that his administration will treat these provisions in a manner consistent with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution.
