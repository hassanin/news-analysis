The President has responded to the Commission on Care's report on the Veterans Affairs health care system. The President believes that there is a sacred covenant between veterans and the nation, where veterans protect the country and the nation takes care of them when they leave the service. The Administration is committed to working with Congress, veterans, and advocacy groups to transform the VA and ensure that all veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve.
