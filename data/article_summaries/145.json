The Department of Defense (DoD) has released a report highlighting the risks posed by extreme consolidation in the defense industrial base (DIB) and emphasizing the need to promote competition. The report states that consolidation has reduced competition and increased national security risks, with the number of aerospace and defense prime contractors shrinking from 51 to just 5 since the 1990s. This reliance on a few companies for critical defense capabilities hampers innovation and performance. The report also highlights the importance of rebuilding DoD's competitive bench by lowering barriers for small businesses and attracting new entrants. The shrinking number of small businesses in the DIB threatens key domestic capabilities, and the report outlines five lines of effort to address these challenges and ensure sufficient domestic capacity and capability in the DIB.
