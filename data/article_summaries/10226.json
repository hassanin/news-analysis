President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring June 2011 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Pride Month. The proclamation recognizes the contributions of the LGBT community in the United States and emphasizes the importance of equal rights for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. The Obama Administration has made progress in achieving equality for LGBT Americans, such as repealing the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy and implementing nondiscrimination policies in federal housing programs. The administration also stands against discrimination targeting LGBT individuals globally and has taken steps to address violence and bullying against LGBT individuals at home. The proclamation also acknowledges the 30th anniversary of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and commits to expanding access to HIV/AIDS prevention and care. The proclamation encourages the American people to eliminate prejudice and celebrate the diversity of the nation.
