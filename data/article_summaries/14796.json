President Barack Obama has proclaimed April 14, 2015, as National Equal Pay Day in the United States. The proclamation highlights the wage gap between men and women, with women earning on average 78 cents for every dollar earned by men. The wage gap is even greater for women of color. The proclamation emphasizes that this wage inequality harms families, communities, and the economy as a whole. President Obama discusses the actions his administration has taken to address this issue, including the signing of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the creation of the National Equal Pay Task Force. He also calls on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to protect everyone's right to a fair wage. The proclamation concludes by urging Americans to recognize the value of women's skills and contributions and to work towards achieving equal pay.
