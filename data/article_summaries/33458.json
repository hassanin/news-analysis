The article discusses the Affordable Care Act (ACA) employer mandate, which requires businesses with 50 or more employees to provide health insurance or pay a penalty. The mandate was intended to ensure that over 150 million Americans had access to private health insurance. However, the implementation of the mandate was delayed multiple times. The article evaluates the economic impact of the mandate and compares the actual revenue collected by the IRS to the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) estimates.

The ACA employer mandate places a burden on smaller firms, as they face higher costs for providing health insurance compared to larger firms. This extra cost can strain small businesses, which are often sources of economic growth. The ACA offers tax credits to assist firms with 25 or fewer employees, but the loading fee for insurance remains high for firms below the 100-worker cutoff.

Another negative consequence of the employer mandate is that it can result in job losses for low-wage workers, especially those working for small- to medium-sized firms near or at the minimum wage. If firms are mandated to provide health insurance or pay a penalty, they may choose to reduce wages or eliminate positions to offset the costs.

The article also highlights a major disconnect between the CBO's projections of penalty payments by employers and the actual revenue collected by the IRS. The CBO projected significantly higher revenue from the employer mandate than what was actually collected. In fact, only approximately 1% of the proposed revenue from the penalty has been collected by the IRS. The cost of enforcing the penalty is also not trivial, with 114 full-time staff members dedicated to enforcement.

Given the underperformance of the employer mandate and its negative economic effects, the article suggests that ending the penalty would be a beneficial policy change.
