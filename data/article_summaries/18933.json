President Obama has accepted the resignation of Louis Caldera as Director of the White House Military Office. The resignation comes after an incident involving the use of Air Force One for a photo shoot over New York City, which caused panic among residents. The President has asked his Deputy Chief of Staff and Defense Secretary Gates to review the organizational structure of the White House Military Office and its reporting relationship to the White House and the Air Force, in order to prevent similar incidents in the future.
