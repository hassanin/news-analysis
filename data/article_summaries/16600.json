Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has expressed his support for President Obama's American Jobs Act. He believes that the President's plan is practical and bold enough to create jobs and help the country overcome its economic challenges. Mayor Villaraigosa specifically highlights the $50 billion investment in transportation job creation, which could potentially create up to 166,000 transportation jobs in LA. He also mentions his own transportation investment plan, America Fast Forward, which has garnered support from mayors, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and AFL-CIO. The mayor urges Congress to extend the transportation bill and pass an expansion of the TIFIA program to put more than 1 million Americans to work nationwide. He also mentions that he will break ground on a rail project that will create over 10,000 jobs, and with the support of Congress and the expansion of TIFIA, several other projects could start and employ 166,000 people in LA.
