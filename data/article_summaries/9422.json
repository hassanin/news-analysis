This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama that terminates the national emergency declared with respect to the actions and policies of the Government of Burma. The order states that the situation that led to the declaration of the national emergency has significantly improved, with Burma making substantial advances in promoting democracy, including holding historic elections in November 2015 and the formation of a democratically elected government. The order revokes previous executive orders related to Burma and waives certain sanctions described in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. It also ends the suspension of entry into the United States for individuals meeting certain criteria. The order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
