On March 24, 2021, the President signed into law H.R. 1276, also known as the SAVE LIVES Act. This law grants the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the power to administer COVID-19 vaccinations to veterans and their spouses. The aim is to strengthen and enhance vaccination efforts within the veteran community, ensuring that all veterans and their partners have access to immunization against the virus.
