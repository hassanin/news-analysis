On December 8, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation recognizing the importance of the Bill of Rights in protecting liberty and freedom against government encroachment. The Bill of Rights, which consists of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, was introduced by James Madison in 1789. It guarantees fundamental rights such as freedom of religion, speech, and the right to bear arms. The proclamation also highlights the global impact of the Bill of Rights, inspiring the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations in 1948. President Trump calls upon the people of the United States to observe Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
