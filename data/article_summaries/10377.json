President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Connecticut due to a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in January 2015. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. The federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, snow assistance, and hazard mitigation measures. Albert L. Lewis has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
