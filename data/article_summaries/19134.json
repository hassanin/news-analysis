President Barack Obama has issued an Executive Order to terminate the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13348 in 2004. This action was taken because Liberia has made significant progress in promoting democracy and the development of its political, administrative, and economic institutions. Executive Order 13348 was originally issued to address the threat posed by former Liberian President Charles Taylor and others who were unlawfully depleting Liberian resources and secreting funds and property. The termination of this national emergency is justified by the advancements made in Liberia, including the successful presidential elections in 2005 and 2011, the conviction and imprisonment of Charles Taylor in 2012, and the diminished ability of those connected to Taylor to undermine Liberia's progress. Additionally, the United Nations Security Council terminated asset freeze obligations on Liberia in September 2015. Thus, there is no longer a need for the asset blocking measures imposed by Executive Order 13348.
