The article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney aboard Air Force One. The press gaggle is about President Obama's upcoming two-day journey across the country as part of his America Forward tour. The President will be visiting Davenport, Iowa; Denver, Colorado; Los Angeles, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Tampa, Florida; Richmond, Virginia; Chicago, Illinois; and Cleveland, Ohio. The purpose of the tour is to engage with Americans, remind them of what's at stake in the election, and encourage them to vote. The press also asked questions about the President's campaign strategy, polling numbers, and the recent Benghazi attack. The press secretary defended the President's policies and addressed concerns about undecided voters and recent polls. The press gaggle ended with a light-hearted question about how much sleep the press secretary and the President got and their excitement about the upcoming trip. The press secretary also commented on Senator Mourdock's controversial comments and Mitt Romney's endorsement of him.
