President Obama released a statement celebrating General Motors' initial public offering (IPO) as a significant milestone in the recovery of both the company and the American auto industry. The government will be reducing its stake in GM by almost half, demonstrating a commitment to exit the investment while safeguarding taxpayer interests. The President also emphasized the importance of making difficult decisions and sacrifices to support the American auto industry, as it has helped save jobs, revive a critical sector of American manufacturing, and enhance competitiveness for the future.
