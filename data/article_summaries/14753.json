President Obama has issued a proclamation declaring April 9, 2013, as National Equal Pay Day. The proclamation highlights the pay gap between men and women, with women earning an average of 23 percent less than men. The disparity is even greater for African-American women and Latinas. The president emphasizes that wage inequality undermines fairness and opportunity, and it has negative effects on families and the economy as a whole. He calls for addressing this inequity and urges the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to recognize the value of women's skills and contributions to the labor force and to work towards achieving equal pay.
