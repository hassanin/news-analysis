On March 1, 2010, the President signed into law the Criminal History Background Checks Pilot Extension Act of 2009. This law extends a pilot program for certain volunteer organizations that serve children to have fingerprint checks on applicants for positions as volunteers or employees. The checks will be processed through the fingerprint identification system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The extension of the pilot program is effective until March 30, 2011.
