The Vice President, Mike Pence, addressed the crisis on the southern border of the United States during a speech at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. He emphasized the need for Mexico to take stronger action to prevent illegal immigration from Central America through its borders and into the US. Pence acknowledged the Mexican delegation's proposals but stated that they were not sufficient to address the crisis. He reiterated President Trump's commitment to stand firm until the issue is resolved and called on Mexico to enforce its own laws and secure its border. Discussions between US and Mexican officials will continue at the State Department.
