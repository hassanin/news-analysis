The author of the article strongly encourages the House to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021. They argue that this act would greatly enhance the power of workers to organize and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. The author believes that as America recovers from the challenges of the pandemic, economic crisis, and racial disparities, it is important to build a new wave of worker power to create an economy that works for everyone. They emphasize the importance of rebuilding unions, as they believe that unions give workers a stronger voice and are critical to strengthening economic competitiveness. The author acknowledges that unions are currently under siege and many employers and states prevent workers from joining unions through anti-union attacks. They argue that the PRO Act would help restore the intent of the National Labor Relations Act and urge Congress to pass the act to provide good jobs, dignity, equity, shared prosperity, and a sense of common purpose for hardworking people.
