The article discusses the NATO summit in Chicago and the capabilities that NATO needs to maintain in order to remain a source of global stability. The article highlights the adoption of the Strategic Concept at the Lisbon Summit in 2010, which commits NATO to meeting security challenges such as terrorism, ballistic missile and cyber attacks, and nuclear proliferation. NATO's leadership outlined a clear vision in a document titled "NATO Forces 2020" that prioritizes investing in capabilities over the next decade. The article also mentions the Deterrence and Defense Posture Review (DDPR) that was concluded and endorsed in Chicago, which reaffirms NATO's commitment to nuclear weapons while working towards a world without them. The article discusses the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) for missile defense, which was implemented in a NATO context and aims to provide full coverage and protection against ballistic missile attacks. The achievement of an Interim Capability for NATO ballistic missile defense is also mentioned, which means NATO has initiated a capability that provides real protection against such attacks. The article further discusses the Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system, which uses unarmed drones to provide crucial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information. NATO signed a contract to move forward with this system, which will be operated and maintained on behalf of the Alliance with common funding from all 28 Allies. The extension of Baltic Air Policing is also mentioned, as it allows Baltic states to forego acquiring expensive fighter aircraft and focus on other high-priority NATO capabilities and operations. Despite tough economic times, NATO has achieved milestones in missile defense and other initiatives, demonstrating the Alliance's ability to work effectively together.
