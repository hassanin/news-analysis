President Donald J. Trump has commended the House of Representatives for passing the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018, also known as S. 488. The bill aims to implement regulatory reforms that would assist American entrepreneurs and small businesses in raising the necessary capital for innovation and job creation. The President congratulates Chairman Hensarling and the Committee on the bipartisan legislation. As the bill moves back to the Senate for further consideration, the Administration plans to collaborate with Congressional leaders to make technical and substantive changes to the legislation, with the aim of presenting the final version to the President as soon as possible.
