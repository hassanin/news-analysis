Vice President Mike Pence visited the Homeland Security Investigations office in Atlanta, Georgia, to show support for the men and women of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and commend them for their work in enforcing immigration laws and keeping communities safe. He highlighted the accomplishments of ICE agents in 2018, including 34,000 criminal arrests of illegal immigrants, the removal of gang members and criminals affiliated with MS-13, the seizure of opioids and fentanyl, and the rescue of human trafficking victims. Pence also acknowledged the challenges faced by the Atlanta Field Office due to the crisis on the southern border, which has resulted in increased drug trafficking and crime in the region. He praised the Atlanta office's efforts in removing nearly 14,000 illegal immigrants over the past two years and the successful investigations and arrests conducted by Homeland Security Investigations. Pence recognized specific ICE agents for their outstanding work, including Scott Sutton, who led the effort to arrest an escaped illegal alien, and Alia El-Sawi, who has shown compassion and care in helping victims of human trafficking. Pence reassured the agents that President Trump and his administration support them and are committed to securing the border and providing the resources needed for their work. He also criticized the mayor of Atlanta for refusing to cooperate with ICE and emphasized that ICE agents bring safety and security to the community. Pence concluded by expressing gratitude to the agents and assuring them that the American people stand with them.
