The Office of the Vice President has received a letter from the Committees requesting a wide range of documents related to an "impeachment inquiry." The Office questions the fairness and due process of this inquiry. They state that if the Committees wish to return to regular legislative oversight, they are willing to work with them. Until then, they will reserve all rights and privileges, including executive privileges and national security. They argue that the House of Representatives has not authorized any impeachment inquiry and that the Speaker's announcement does not fulfill the constitutional requirement of a majority vote. The Office encourages the Committees to reconsider their request or seek information from primary sources.
