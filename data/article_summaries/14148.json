President Obama released a statement on the inclusion of women in the U.S. military, highlighting the importance of drawing on the talents and skills of all Americans. He mentioned previous milestones such as desegregation and allowing gay and lesbian Americans to serve openly, which he believed made the military stronger. The President praised the courageous women who have served on the front lines and made the ultimate sacrifice in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Defense Department is now taking another historic step by opening up the remaining 10 percent of military positions, including combat roles, to women. President Obama expressed confidence that this change, like previous ones, will make the military even stronger and provide new opportunities for women to serve. He emphasized the importance of implementing this transition responsibly while maintaining military readiness and professionalism. The President reaffirmed his commitment to ensuring that the U.S. military remains the finest fighting force in history.
