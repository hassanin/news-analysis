On National Air Traffic Control Day, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recognizes the hardworking air traffic controllers who play a critical role in air travel. In 2017, these professionals oversaw the safe movement of planes carrying over 840 million passengers and 39 billion pounds of freight in the United States. The safety of millions of travelers and tons of cargo relies on the important responsibility of air traffic controllers. To enhance transportation safety and the economy, the Trump Administration continues to pursue the modernization of the nation's air traffic control services. This includes making targeted investments in next-generation technology systems to improve the delivery of air traffic control services and ensure controllers have access to the technology they need. These efforts aim to efficiently transport goods in the new economy and enhance the flying experience for air travelers.
