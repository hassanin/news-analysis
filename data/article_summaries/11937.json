This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2014. The order amended two previous executive orders, 11478 and 11246, to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the federal government and federal government procurement. The order also instructed the Secretary of Labor to prepare regulations within 90 days to implement the requirements of the order. The order clarified that it does not affect the authority of agencies or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. The order became effective immediately and applied to contracts entered into after the effective date of the rules promulgated by the Department of Labor.
