President Biden has appointed nine governors to the Council of Governors for two-year terms. The bipartisan council aims to strengthen partnerships between the federal government and state governments in order to protect the nation from homeland security threats and other hazards. The council focuses on matters such as homeland security, civil support, and coordination between state and federal military activities. The council will work closely with the Biden-Harris administration to enhance preparedness, resilience, and response for all Americans. The council includes leaders from various federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security. Governor Bill Lee of Tennessee is already a member of the council.
