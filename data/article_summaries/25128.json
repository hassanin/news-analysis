President Trump hosted the second "Made in America" product showcase at the White House, inviting companies from all 50 states to celebrate American workers. For a product to be labeled "Made in USA," it must be "all or virtually all" made in the United States, meaning that all significant parts and processing must be of U.S. origin. President Trump emphasized the importance of supporting American businesses and manufacturing, stating that the country is starting to bring back the "Made in America" label. The showcase featured various products from different states, highlighting the quality and pride of American-made goods.
