Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood has announced funding for 51 transportation projects across the country. The projects, funded through the TIGER program, were included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and aim to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. The projects will focus on improving roads, bridges, rail, ports, transit, and intermodal facilities. The Department of Transportation received over 1,400 applications requesting funding for almost $60 billion worth of projects, highlighting the strong demand for the program. The selected projects represent a diverse range of transportation needs and will help improve economic competitiveness, safety, quality of life, and environmental sustainability. Sixty percent of the funding will go to economically distressed areas. Recipients of the funding will be required to report on their activities regularly.
