President Biden is delivering on his promise to provide student debt relief by announcing a three-part plan. The cost of college has tripled since 1980, while federal support has not kept up. As a result, many low- and middle-income students are forced to borrow, leaving them with significant debt burdens. The plan includes targeted debt relief, with up to $20,000 in loan relief for borrowers with individual incomes below $125,000 ($250,000 for married couples) who received a Pell Grant. Borrowers who meet the income standards but did not receive a Pell Grant can receive up to $10,000 in relief. The Department of Education estimates that roughly 27 million borrowers will be eligible for relief. The plan also aims to make the student loan system more manageable by reforming income-driven repayment plans and ensuring public servants receive credit toward loan forgiveness. The Department of Education will extend the student loan pause through December 31, 2022, and make it easier for borrowers to stay enrolled in repayment plans. Additionally, the plan includes efforts to protect borrowers and taxpayers from steep increases in college costs and hold colleges accountable for their role in the student debt crisis.
