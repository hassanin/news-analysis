The article is a statement from the White House Press Secretary regarding the United Nations Climate Change Conference. The President believes that all nations have a responsibility to combat climate change and has taken action domestically to invest in clean energy solutions and reduce dependence on oil. The President has also engaged with other leaders on the issue of climate change and agreed to participate in the Copenhagen conference. Progress has been made towards a meaningful accord, with China and India setting targets to reduce carbon intensity for the first time. The President has discussed the negotiations with other world leaders and believes that a core element of the Copenhagen accord should be to mobilize $10 billion a year by 2012 to support adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. The United States will pay its fair share of this amount. The President will participate in the conference on December 18th to pursue a positive outcome, while State Department negotiators and Cabinet officials will represent the US throughout the negotiating process.
