According to experts, seniors and other Americans on Social Security will see an average increase of $140 per month in their monthly checks starting in January. This is the first time in over a decade that seniors' Medicare premiums will decrease while their Social Security checks increase. This combination of rising benefits and falling premiums will allow seniors to stay ahead of inflation. However, MAGA Republicans in Congress are still threatening Social Security and Medicare, proposing changes every five years that could impact benefits and eligibility. The President, on the other hand, aims to continue progress and save seniors money.
