The Department of Justice has filed an appeal against a District Court ruling on the student debt relief program. The President and the Administration are committed to helping working and middle-class Americans recover, while their opponents, supported by extreme Republican special interests, have sued to prevent relief for millions of Americans. The Department will retain the information of the 26 million borrowers who have already submitted it for consideration, so that their relief can be processed quickly once the court ruling is in their favor. The Administration vows to continue fighting for those in need, regardless of the obstacles put in their way.
