Vice President Mike Pence recently led a discussion with the chief executives and senior leaders of approximately 50 states, territories, and the White House Coronavirus Task Force to discuss COVID-19 response and recovery efforts. The discussion focused on vaccine and therapeutic distribution, the use of monoclonal antibodies to prevent severe illness, and the importance of leveraging outpatient infusion centers to increase access to therapeutics. The Vice President also emphasized the need for continued vigilance with handwashing, social distancing, and mask-wearing. Updates were provided on federal PPE and medical personnel support, and the successful efforts to bolster the Strategic National Stockpile. The discussion also highlighted the importance of expanding vaccine access for vulnerable populations, such as citizens over 65 and adults with co-morbidities. Efforts to scale vaccine administration were discussed, including expanding eligibility groups and increasing access points beyond hospitals. The Vice President encouraged states to increase demand for vaccines and administer shots more quickly. Best practices for vaccine administration were shared by the Governors of Maine, North Dakota, and West Virginia. Since January 2020, the Trump Administration has organized governors-only briefings to facilitate communication and collaboration on COVID-19 response, recovery, and vaccination.
