President Biden personally spoke with Lieutenant Commander Christopher Hooper and Aviation Survival Technician Second Class Zach Loesch to thank them for their heroic work during search and rescue operations in response to Hurricane Ian. The President expressed his gratitude for their efforts in saving lives and asked for an update on ongoing rescue operations in Florida. He also offered additional support if needed, but they stated that they have the necessary resources to carry out their mission. Under the President's direction, numerous Coast Guard helicopters and rescue boats were deployed to assist in search and rescue operations, coordinated by FEMA. So far, their efforts have saved hundreds of lives, with the U.S. Coast Guard playing a significant role. As of yesterday morning, 16 Coast Guard aircraft have been deployed, rescuing over 100 people along the southwest coast of Florida.
