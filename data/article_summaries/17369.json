Mayors from various cities across the United States have expressed their support for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and opposition to its repeal. They highlight the benefits of the ACA, such as providing health insurance coverage to millions of Americans, protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions, and expanding access to affordable care options. The mayors argue that repealing the ACA would leave many Americans without insurance and increase healthcare costs. They emphasize the importance of continuing to implement and strengthen the ACA to improve the quality of life for citizens and address healthcare disparities.
