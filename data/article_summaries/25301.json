On December 20, 2017, the President declared a national emergency in response to serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and was meant to address the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption originating from outside the United States still pose a significant threat to the country. Therefore, the national emergency declaration is being extended for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
