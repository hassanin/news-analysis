On March 23, 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to address the healthcare challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The order delegates authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to prevent hoarding of health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States. The Secretary is given the power to prescribe conditions with respect to the accumulation of such resources and to designate any material as scarce or threatened by hoarding. The Secretary is also required to consult with the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and adopt necessary rules and regulations to implement the order. The order further states that the Secretary should periodically consider whether the designations made under this order remain necessary and withdraw any unnecessary designations. The order does not impair or affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The order does not create any right or benefit enforceable against the United States or any other party.
