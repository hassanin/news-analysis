It highlights the increasing number of domestic violence incidents worldwide, including rising femicide in Turkey, and argues that countries should be strengthening their commitments to ending violence against women rather than rejecting international treaties. The withdrawal is seen as a setback for the global movement to end violence against women. The article emphasizes that gender-based violence is a problem affecting every nation and calls for more efforts to create societies where women can live without fear of violence.
