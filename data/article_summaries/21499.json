Bosco Ntaganda, a leader of various armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has surrendered to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. Ntaganda is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including rape, murder, sexual slavery, and the forced recruitment of Congolese children as soldiers. The surrender is seen as a significant moment for international justice and the people of eastern Congo. Ntaganda had evaded capture for almost seven years. The United States expresses gratitude to the governments of Rwanda, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom for their cooperation in facilitating Ntaganda's transfer. The hope is that this development will contribute to efforts in finding a comprehensive political agreement that addresses the region's security, economic, and governance issues.
