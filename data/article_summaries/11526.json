President Obama has declared a major disaster in Kentucky due to severe storms, tornadoes, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred from April 2-17, 2015. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in the affected areas. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid individuals and business owners. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has designated Joe M. Girot as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The FEMA News Desk can provide further information.
