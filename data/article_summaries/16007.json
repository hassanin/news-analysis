The White House has released a new report called "Women in America: Indicators of Social and Economic Well-Being," which is the first comprehensive federal report on women since 1963. The report focuses on five critical areas: people, families and income; education; employment; health; and crime and violence. It highlights that women have caught up with men in college attendance and are now more likely to have a college or graduate degree. However, there are still wage and income inequities, with women earning about 75 percent of what men earn. Women also face certain health problems and are less likely to have a usual source of health care. Women are less likely to be victims of violent crimes but are more likely to be victims of intimate partner violence and stalking. The report aims to inform policymakers, journalists, and researchers. Throughout Women's History Month, Administration officials will participate in events focused on policies that impact women.
