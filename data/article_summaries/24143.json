The President has ordered several actions in response to Russia's aggressive harassment of US officials and cyber operations aimed at the US election. This includes issuing an executive order that provides additional authority for responding to cyber activity that interferes with election processes, sanctioning nine entities and individuals involved in Russian intelligence services, designating two individuals for misappropriation of funds and personal identifying information, shutting down two Russian compounds in Maryland and New York, and declaring 35 Russian intelligence operatives as "persona non grata". The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are also releasing declassified technical information on Russian cyber activity to help identify and disrupt their malicious activities. The US will continue to take undisclosed actions and work with allies to oppose Russia's efforts to undermine international norms and interfere with democratic governance. The Administration will also provide a report to Congress about Russia's interference in the US election.
