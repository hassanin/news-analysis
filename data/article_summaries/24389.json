Since March 2014, there has been a significant effort to minimize the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in civilian applications. The goal is to reduce the number of potential targets for terrorists and unauthorized actors to obtain this material. This is achieved through activities such as HEU reactor conversions and shut-downs, nuclear material removals, technology substitution, and down-blending. 

The international community, through the Nuclear Security Summit process, has made progress in minimizing HEU. The United States has supported the conversion of HEU reactors in Russia, Jamaica, China, and Kazakhstan. They have also confirmed the shutdown of four HEU reactors in Russia, Uzbekistan, and Switzerland. 

Once facilities are converted and HEU is no longer needed, the material can be removed. Since March 2014, the United States has removed or confirmed the disposition of approximately 450 kilograms of HEU from 10 countries. As a result, three additional countries (Switzerland, Uzbekistan, and Argentina) are now considered free of HEU, meaning they have less than one kilogram of HEU on their territory. In total, 29 countries plus Taiwan are now HEU-free after eliminating their HEU.
