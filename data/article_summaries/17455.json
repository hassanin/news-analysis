President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Somalia will continue beyond April 12, 2015. The national emergency was declared in Executive Order 13536 on April 12, 2010. While there have been positive developments in Somalia's stabilization, such as the recognition of the Government of Somalia by the United States and the nomination of the first U.S. Ambassador to Somalia in over two decades, the importance of U.S. sanctions against those undermining Somalia's stability remains. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency and the sanctions in response to this threat.
