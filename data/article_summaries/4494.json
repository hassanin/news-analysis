The United Nations has voted to remove Iran from the Commission on the Status of Women due to the country's repression of women and girls. This vote reflects a growing international consensus on Iran and the demand for accountability. The United States, along with its allies, is working to hold Iran accountable for its abuses against its own people, including peaceful protesters, women and girls, and its involvement in violence against Ukraine. In the past week, the United States has issued multiple sets of sanctions targeting Iran's financing of terror, human rights violations, and provision of UAVs to Russia. These actions are in coordination with other countries that have also imposed sanctions. Additionally, there have been ongoing sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program, a fact-finding mission established by the UN Human Rights Council, and a joint statement condemning online harassment and abuse by Iranian authorities against women protestors. The recent executions in Tehran further strengthen the resolve to expand the consensus and pursue accountability against the Iranian regime and its officials responsible for these atrocities.
