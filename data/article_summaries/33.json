The President held a virtual meeting with House Democratic leadership and the chairs of 15 House committees to discuss his Build Back Better agenda. The agenda aims to cut prescription drug costs, reduce housing and education expenses, improve care for veterans, address climate change, and make childcare and care for older Americans more affordable. The President and House leaders agreed that these initiatives would benefit the American people and should not be delayed. They also discussed financing these investments by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug costs and increasing taxes on large corporations and wealthy individuals. The President expressed his commitment to these policies and his eagerness to sign the Build Back Better bill and the bipartisan infrastructure legislation soon.
