This article is a joint statement by the Presidents of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair countries - France, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America - regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The Presidents express their commitment to helping the parties reach a lasting and peaceful settlement. They express regret that the parties have been seeking one-sided advantage instead of a solution based on mutual interests. The Presidents believe that the elements outlined in their countries' statements over the last four years should form the foundation of any fair and lasting settlement. They emphasize that only a negotiated settlement can lead to peace, stability, and regional development. The use of military force will not resolve the conflict and could have disastrous consequences. The leaders are urged to recommit to the Helsinki principles, including the non-use of force, territorial integrity, and equal rights and self-determination of peoples. They are also urged to refrain from actions or rhetoric that could escalate the conflict. The responsibility for ending the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lies with the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia. Further delay in reaching a balanced agreement is deemed unacceptable, and the leaders are urged to focus on unresolved issues with renewed energy.
