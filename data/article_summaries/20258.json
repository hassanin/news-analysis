The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet on the North American Working Group on Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls. This working group is a tri-lateral initiative between the United States, Mexico, and Canada to address the high levels of domestic and sexual violence against indigenous women and girls across the continent. The fact sheet outlines the commitments, resources, and initiatives announced by the Obama Administration to enhance tribal justice and support survivors. These include the launch of the Strong Hearts Helpline, a crisis line for Alaska Native and American Indian women and girls, the implementation of specialized services for abused parents and their children, and the hosting of a roundtable on cross-border tribal justice. The fact sheet also highlights new guidelines for responding to intimate partner violence from the Indian Health Service, consultations with Alaska Native leaders, investments in tribal justice, and research efforts to expand the evidence base on violence against Native women and girls. Additionally, the fact sheet discusses the Administration's efforts to address violence against indigenous women and girls globally, such as strengthening international frameworks and supporting increased representation of indigenous peoples at the United Nations. The fact sheet concludes by highlighting the Administration's record on tribal issues and supporting Native women and girls, including the restoration of tribal sovereignty, the implementation of the Violence Against Women Act, and investments in social services and public health prevention.
