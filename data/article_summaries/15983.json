President Obama had a call with Prime Minister Rutte of the Netherlands. They both agreed that securing the crash site and conducting a transparent investigation should be the main priority after repatriating the victims' remains. They also discussed concerns about Russia's continued support for separatists in Ukraine and agreed that the EU and United States should remain united and impose increasing costs on Russia if it continues destabilizing Ukraine.
