The article is a statement by the Press Secretary regarding John Brennan's meeting with Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Salih. The meeting took place in Riyadh, where Brennan wished the President a speedy recovery from injuries sustained in a June 3rd attack. Brennan condemned the attack and urged President Salih to sign the GCC-brokered agreement for a peaceful and constitutional political transition in Yemen. He emphasized the importance of resolving the political crisis in Sanaa so that Yemen can effectively address challenges, including terrorist attacks by al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula. The United States is working with Yemen's allies to provide assistance once the GCC proposal is signed and implemented. The United States believes that a transition in Yemen should begin immediately to fulfill the aspirations of the Yemeni people.
