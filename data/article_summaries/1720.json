The joint statement, signed by Australia, Denmark, Norway, and the United States, emphasizes the importance of advanced technologies for global economic growth and communication. However, it also highlights concerns regarding the use of surveillance tools and related technologies by authoritarian governments to commit human rights abuses. The statement commits to working towards establishing a voluntary, nonbinding code of conduct that would use export control tools to prevent the proliferation of software and technologies enabling such abuses. Canada, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have expressed support for this initiative.
