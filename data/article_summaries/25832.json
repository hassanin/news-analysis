The Trump administration is committed to ending human trafficking, and the House of Representatives has passed three bills that are seen as important progress in achieving this goal. President Trump has met with survivors, non-profit organizations, and faith leaders who are actively working to raise awareness about human trafficking. The president is optimistic that the Senate will also pass these bills and looks forward to continuing to work with Congress on this issue.
