President Biden has signed a proclamation establishing the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni – Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument in Arizona. This designation, the fifth new national monument established by President Biden, aims to protect sacred ancestral places and important features, conserve public lands, and support local economies. Tribal leaders, elected officials, and conservation leaders have praised the announcement, highlighting the significance of the designation in preserving cultural heritage and protecting wildlife habitat and clean water. The designation is seen as a major victory for Native American tribes, outdoor enthusiasts, and environmentalists who have long fought to protect the land from destruction and pollution caused by mining and development.
