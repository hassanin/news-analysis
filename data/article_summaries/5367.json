President Biden has announced the launch of the Federally Qualified Health Center program, which aims to provide more vaccines for Community Health Centers in underserved and vulnerable communities. This program is part of the administration's efforts to speed up vaccinations and ensure equitable distribution. The first phase of the program will begin the week of February 15, with Community Health Centers directly receiving vaccine supply. The initial phase will include at least one center in each state, eventually expanding to 250 centers. In addition, the administration will increase the overall weekly vaccine supply to states, Tribes, and territories by 5% over last week, totaling a 28% increase since President Biden took office. The goal is to administer 100 million shots in 100 days.
