Jill and I express our condolences to the families affected by the wildfires in Maui. We are grateful for the bravery of firefighters and first responders who are risking their lives to save others. Federal assets have been deployed to aid in the response, including the Hawaiian National Guard, U.S. Coast Guard, Navy Third Fleets, and Army. The Department of Transportation is working with airlines to evacuate tourists, and the Department of the Interior and United States Department of Agriculture are prepared to assist in recovery efforts. Residents are urged to follow evacuation orders and stay alert.
