Vice President Biden gave a press gaggle at the U.S. Capitol discussing progress on negotiations for the budget. He mentioned that the appropriations committees met and they are all working with the same number, which is $73 billion. However, there are differences in the composition of that number, which will be thoroughly negotiated. The goal is to reach an agreement to avoid a government shutdown, as they are working off the same number. The Democrats are in full agreement with the administration on what the makeup of the $73 billion should be. The Vice President stated that riders and the composition of the budget will be part of the negotiation process. He emphasized that there is no deal until there is a whole deal, including the makeup of the $73 billion. The Vice President and the President are not big on riders, but the appropriators will get into the details. The main purpose of the press gaggle was to ensure that Democrats in the Senate and the President are on the same page. The Vice President clarified that the makeup of the $73 billion includes everything from discretionary spending to defense, mandatory to non-mandatory, and it makes up the totality of the budget. Negotiations also involve what riders both sides are willing to accept. The Vice President concluded by saying that it's not a deal until it's a whole deal.
