The White House Press Secretary released a statement on the case of State of Texas v. United States of America. The statement asserts that the federal government has the authority to prioritize the enforcement of immigration laws, and that the President's policies are consistent with previous laws, Supreme Court decisions, and precedent set by past presidents. The Department of Justice, legal scholars, immigration experts, and a district court in Washington, D.C. have all determined that the President's actions are legally sound. The statement also mentions that top law enforcement officials, as well as state and local leaders, believe that these policies will benefit the economy and improve community safety. The district court's decision to prevent the policies from taking effect is deemed as incorrect, and the Department of Justice plans to appeal.
