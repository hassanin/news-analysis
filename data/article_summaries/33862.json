On Blind Americans Equality Day, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation recognizing the contributions of Americans who are blind and visually impaired. He emphasized the value of creating greater opportunities for these individuals to live full and independent lives. The President signed an Executive Order establishing the National Council for the American Worker, which will develop recommendations for a national strategy to empower American workers, including those who are blind or visually impaired, to learn the skills needed for sustained employment. The administration also supports federal programs such as the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facilities Program and the Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind Program, which provide entrepreneurial opportunities and support services for individuals who are blind or visually impaired. In addition, President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to providing more opportunities for these individuals to enjoy freedom and independence and called upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to reaffirm the commitment to achieving equality for all Americans.
