President Joe Biden has issued an executive order expanding the scope of a national emergency declared in 2001. The order blocks the property and interests in property of individuals determined to be involved in actions or policies that threaten peace, security, stability, or territorial integrity in the Western Balkans. It also targets those responsible for undermining democratic processes, violating regional agreements, committing human rights abuses, or engaging in corruption in the region. The order prohibits the making or receipt of contributions, provision of funds, goods, or services to or from blocked individuals. Additionally, it suspends the entry of noncitizens who meet the criteria outlined in the order, unless it is determined to be in the interest of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to implement the order. The order does not affect transactions related to the official business of the Federal Government.
