The first bill, H.R. 3961, extends several terrorist surveillance provisions included in the USA PATRIOT Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 for one year. The second bill, H.R. 4532, known as the "Social Security Disability Applicantsâ€™ Access to Professional Representation Act of 2010," makes permanent the Social Security Administration programs that allow direct payment of attorneys and certain non-attorney representatives in Social Security and Supplemental Security Income claims cases.
