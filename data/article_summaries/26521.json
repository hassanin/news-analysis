In this op-ed, the Secretary of the Interior discusses the role of wind energy, particularly offshore wind, in America's energy dominance and job creation. The Trump administration's "all-of-the-above" approach to energy production aims to prioritize both market forces and national security and energy policy. The Secretary emphasizes the importance of wind energy in diversifying the energy mix and modernizing American infrastructure. The Interior Department is working on guidelines to provide more flexibility for wind developers and promote industry innovation. The op-ed also mentions proposed lease sales for wind energy off Massachusetts and in the New York Bight. However, the Secretary acknowledges the need to address concerns from fishermen and protect marine wildlife when considering wind development. Overall, the Trump administration supports wind energy as part of its broader energy policy.
