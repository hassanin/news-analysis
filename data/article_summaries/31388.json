In his weekly address, President Trump discusses the need for immigration reform in the United States. He highlights the flaws in the current system, such as chain migration and the visa lottery, which he believes prioritize family ties over skill or merit. The President argues that this outdated system poses a threat to national security and puts a strain on federal welfare. He calls for a merit-based immigration system that selects newcomers based on their ability to financially support themselves and make positive contributions to society. The President urges Congress to pass a bill to end chain migration and the visa lottery, emphasizing that this will promote assimilation, wage growth, and safety for both old and new Americans.
