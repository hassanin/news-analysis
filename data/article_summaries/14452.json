The White House has released a fact sheet outlining President Obama's plan to increase oversight and crack down on manipulation in oil markets. The plan includes requesting immediate funding to increase surveillance and enforcement staff for oil futures market trading, funding critical technology upgrades for monitoring energy market activity, increasing civil and criminal penalties for manipulation in energy markets, empowering the CFTC to raise margin requirements in oil futures markets, and expanding access to CFTC data to better understand trading trends in oil markets. The fact sheet also highlights the administration's previous actions to enhance oversight of energy markets, such as implementing position limits and closing loopholes that allowed traders to evade regulation. The administration has also created the Oil and Gas Price Fraud Working Group to monitor for fraud and manipulation in oil and gasoline markets.
