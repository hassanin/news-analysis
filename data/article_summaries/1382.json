President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico and U.S. Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall met in Mexico City to discuss and enhance the migration initiative announced by President López Obrador and President Biden in January 2023. As a result, the United States and Mexico have announced additional measures to address the humanitarian situation caused by unprecedented migration flows at their shared border and in the region. These measures include increasing joint actions to counter human smugglers and traffickers, enhancing efforts in Central America to address the root causes of migration, recognizing the value of regional processing centers, continuing the successful joint initiative beyond May 11, 2023, and committing to modernize the shared border.
