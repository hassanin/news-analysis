This article is a memorandum from President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2024. The President has determined that the admission of up to 125,000 refugees to the United States in FY 2024 is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest. The admissions numbers will be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States based on regional allocations. The regional allocations are as follows: Africa (30,000-50,000), East Asia (10,000-20,000), Europe and Central Asia (2,000-3,000), Latin America/Caribbean (35,000-50,000), and Near East/South Asia (30,000-45,000). The total admissions among all regions cannot exceed 125,000. Unused admissions allocated to a particular region may be transferred to other regions if there is a need for greater admissions. The President also determines that assistance to persons applying for admission to the United States as part of the overseas refugee admissions program will contribute to the foreign policy interests of the United States. The memorandum concludes by authorizing the publication of this determination in the Federal Register.
