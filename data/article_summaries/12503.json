President Barack Obama will host a White House reception on May 17 to honor Jewish American Heritage Month. The reception will recognize the history and contributions of Jewish Americans in various fields such as business, the arts, education, and public service. This event continues the tradition of proclaiming May as Jewish American Heritage Month, which was started by the previous administration. Last year, the President and First Lady hosted the first-ever White House reception for this occasion. In his proclamation, President Obama highlighted the achievements of Jewish Americans throughout history, including their scientific accomplishments, literary and musical works, and military service. Further details about the reception will be announced later.
