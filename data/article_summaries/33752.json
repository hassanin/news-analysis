President Donald J. Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of Defense to develop a policy that allows graduates of Military Service Academies and Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs to participate in professional sports while fulfilling their military service obligations. The President believes that highly talented cadets and midshipmen who have received education benefits from taxpayer expense should have the opportunity to pursue professional sports while still honoring their commitment to the Armed Forces and the country. This new policy aims to strengthen the competitiveness of the Academies in sports and benefit student-athletes and the Armed Forces. The President emphasizes the importance of having a strong military in all aspects, including athletics.
