President Donald Trump has proclaimed November 2020 as National Adoption Month in the United States. In his proclamation, he highlights the importance of adoption in providing children with stable homes and families who can ensure their well-being. The proclamation recognizes birth families who make the difficult decision to place their children up for adoption, foster parents who care for children from different backgrounds, and adoptive parents who open their families to children in need. President Trump emphasizes the commitment of his administration to address the causes of child abuse and neglect, support families struggling with addiction, and expand avenues for adoption. Efforts include addressing the opioid crisis, increasing funding and oversight of the foster care system, and providing guidance to states on the use of federal funds for legal representation in family legal proceedings. The proclamation also acknowledges the challenges faced by children in the foster care system, such as long waits for adoption and aging out without finding a forever family, leading to negative consequences like homelessness and unemployment. President Trump signed an Executive Order in June to strengthen the child welfare system, prioritize partnerships between organizations, provide resources for trauma training and support, and advocate for safe, forever families. Adoption is also presented as an alternative to abortion, with the administration encouraging adoption as a loving option for women facing unexpected pregnancies or unable to provide for their children. The proclamation concludes by celebrating the blessings of adoption and urging Americans to observe National Adoption Month by helping children and youth in need of permanent homes secure a more promising future with a forever family.
