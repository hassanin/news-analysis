The White House has announced that a Forum on Jobs and Economic Growth will be held on December 3rd. The forum will provide an opportunity for the President and his economic team to hear from CEOs, small business owners, and financial experts on ideas for growing the economy and creating jobs. Following the forum, President Obama will embark on a White House to Main Street Tour, starting with a visit to Allentown, Pennsylvania. This tour aims to allow the President to engage with workers and gain insight into the challenges faced by Americans during the economic downturn. More details on both the forum and the President's trip will be announced soon.
