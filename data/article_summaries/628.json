According to the article, Americans are returning to work at a historic rate, with fewer people filing for unemployment insurance in the past four weeks than ever before. The economy has added 7.9 million jobs since the current President took office, which is a higher average per month than any other President in history. This job growth is attributed to the American Rescue Plan, which funded vaccination efforts, reopened schools, and stimulated economic growth. While there is still work to be done to address rising costs and global challenges, the data suggests that the economy is recovering and overcoming the impact of the pandemic.
