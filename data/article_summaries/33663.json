The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released the results of its annual estimates on coca cultivation and cocaine production in Peru. The report shows a significant increase in coca cultivation to 72,000 hectares in 2019, with a potential production of 649 metric tons of pure cocaine. The United States expresses support for Peru's eradication efforts, particularly in high-coca producing areas such as Puno and the Valley of the Apur√≠mac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers (VRAEM). However, concrete results are needed to reverse the rising trend of coca cultivation and cocaine production. The Trump Administration emphasizes the importance of counternarcotics operations to combat drug cartels, with efforts resulting in the prevention of 183,521 pounds of cocaine from entering the United States and $2.1 billion in lost revenue for drug cartels. The ONDCP calls for Peru to expand its efforts in curbing coca cultivation and production to further combat drug trafficking and protect American lives.
