The U.S. government has praised Israel for opening its border crossing at Kerem Shalom to allow direct delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. This is seen as a significant step in alleviating the suffering of innocent Palestinians in the conflict. The U.S. continues to urge Israel to prevent civilian casualties and conduct operations as surgically and precisely as possible. In regards to the situation in Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. has allocated the remaining funding to restock U.S. supplies and replace what is being sent to Ukraine. However, the U.S. will need Congress to act without delay to provide further assistance to Ukraine. The U.S. is concerned about the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the actions of Russian troops, which include launching attacks on Ukrainian cities and attempting a ground offensive. The U.S. continues to support Ukraine and calls on Congress to act in defense of national security interests.
