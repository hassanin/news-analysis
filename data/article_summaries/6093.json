The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has raised concerns about the risk it poses to women's health and lives. However, voters in Kansas have rejected efforts to amend the state constitution and restrict women's right to choose. This shows that the majority of Americans believe in women's access to abortion and the ability to make their own healthcare decisions. Congress should take note of this and reinstate Roe as federal law. While this is the best way to protect women's right to choose, the administration will also take action to safeguard women's reproductive healthcare. It is important for the American people to continue using their voices to protect women's healthcare, including abortion.
