The Trump Administration's focus on deregulation and innovation has led to significant advancements in the energy sector. These innovations have boosted productivity, reduced energy prices for consumers, and made the United States a net exporter of petroleum and natural gas. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) highlighted the benefits of oil and gas innovation, showing that shale production has greatly increased extraction productivity for natural gas and oil. This has led to a 63 percent reduction in the domestic price of natural gas and a 45 percent decrease in the wholesale price of electricity. The shale revolution has also resulted in a 10 percent decrease in the global price of oil, saving U.S. consumers $203 billion annually. These savings benefit all consumers, but have a greater impact on lower-income households. The report also emphasizes that innovation can lead to greater environmental benefits than regulations. The shale revolution has reduced energy-related greenhouse gas emissions by 527 million metric tons per year, surpassing the projected environmental benefits of EPA regulations. The Trump Administration's pro-growth policies have strengthened the energy sector's relationship with the private sector, resulting in increased LNG exports and coal exports that exceed forecasts. The administration has also promoted the development of alternative uses for coal and supports carbon capture and storage technologies. Renewable energy capacity has also grown, surpassing forecasts and becoming cost-competitive with other sources of energy. Despite these advancements, emissions have been falling, with pollutant concentrations decreasing since 2017. Overall, the Trump Administration's focus on innovation has brought positive results for consumers, businesses, and the environment.
