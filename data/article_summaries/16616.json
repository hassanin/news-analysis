In this article, it is mentioned that President Obama visited Stromberg Sheet Metal, a medium-sized business in Beltsville, Maryland. The President toured the facilities and delivered remarks to the employees. The company employs around 350 people and plans to expand the workforce as revenues increase and new projects come online in the coming year. 

The President discussed a new report by the Department of the Treasury that highlights how his proposal to allow businesses and investors to deduct the full cost of most investments immediately will help businesses expand and hire. The proposal would enable businesses like Stromberg to invest in new equipment and deduct 100% of the investment upfront. This would provide businesses with real money to use for expansion or hiring new workers, creating more jobs. 

Senator Ben Cardin from Maryland was expected to attend the visit. The article also provides background information on Stromberg Sheet Metal, including its founding in 1940 by Paul Stromberg and subsequent growth under the leadership of engineers Cavet Snyder and Robert Gawne. Gawne later purchased the company in 1987 through an Employee Stock Option Plan. He has been the CEO of Stromberg Sheet Metal since then.
