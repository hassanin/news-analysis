President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation recognizing October 2018 as National Energy Awareness Month. The proclamation highlights the role of American energy in providing abundant, affordable, and reliable power for the nation and the world. The administration's agenda includes reducing regulatory burdens on the energy sector, developing innovative energy technologies, and building new energy-related infrastructure. The United States is becoming both energy independent and energy dominant, with crude oil production reaching 11 million barrels a day and the country being the largest global producer of natural gas. American energy dominance means less dependence on foreign energy and more access to reliable and affordable energy supplies, giving industries a competitive edge in the global marketplace. The proclamation also emphasizes the responsible stewardship of the environment and the development of energy resources to grow the economy, lower costs, create jobs, and increase incomes for American workers. The United States has been leading the world in reducing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions and has seen a significant drop in combined emissions from common pollutants while the economy continues to grow. The proclamation concludes with a commitment to strengthening energy security and responsibly using energy resources to achieve energy independence and dominance.
