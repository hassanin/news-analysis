National Poison Prevention Week was established by Congress to raise awareness about the dangers of poisoning and to encourage Americans to take preventive measures. This year, the reminder is particularly timely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as 9 out of 10 poisonings occur inside the home. Children and isolated seniors are at an increased risk of accidental poisoning. Commonly ingested products include hand sanitizer, household cleaning products, laundry packets, medications, coin cell batteries, and liquid nicotine. These should be stored in child-resistant packaging and kept out of reach of children. In 2019, approximately 67,500 children under the age of 5 had to visit the emergency room due to unintended poisoning, with most incidents occurring in the home. Elderly Americans are also at risk, especially those isolated due to the pandemic. Poison control centers are a vital resource in responding to poisonings, including opioid-related incidents. Overdose deaths, mainly driven by opioids, have significantly increased in recent years. Legal substances like liquid nicotine can also be deadly if ingested, particularly for children. If someone is believed to have been poisoned, the Poison Control Help line should be immediately called. National Poison Prevention Week is observed from March 21 to March 27, 2021, and Americans are encouraged to safeguard their families from poisonous products and raise awareness of the dangers to prevent accidents.
