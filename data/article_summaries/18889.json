In this memorandum, President Barack Obama addresses the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). SCHIP aims to provide health coverage for uninsured children in families who have incomes too high for Medicaid but cannot afford private insurance. Since 1997, states have been able to set their own income eligibility levels for SCHIP, depending on available funding. However, in 2007, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a letter that limited the flexibility of states to set income eligibility standards for their SCHIP programs. This letter imposed additional requirements that limited coverage under several state plans, resulting in thousands of children being denied health care coverage. President Obama requests the immediate withdrawal of the 2007 and 2008 letters and the implementation of SCHIP without the requirements imposed by those letters. The memorandum concludes by stating that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
