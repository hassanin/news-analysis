On January 8, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to promote better access to broadband internet service in rural America. The order aims to accelerate the deployment and adoption of affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband connectivity in rural areas. It calls for the reduction of barriers to capital investment, the removal of obstacles to broadband services, and the more efficient use of government resources. The order also directs the General Services Administration (GSA) to develop a common form and master contract for wireless facility sitings on federal properties, which will streamline the process for installing wireless broadband facilities. The order requires the GSA to evaluate the effectiveness of the common form application and make any necessary revisions within 180 days. Federal property managing agencies are instructed to use the common form application for requests to locate broadband facilities on federal property and to promptly review and approve such requests unless it negatively affects the agency's mission or is not in the best interests of the United States. The federal property managing agencies are also required to report on their use of the common form application and the number of applications received, approved, and rejected. The Administrator of GSA is responsible for preparing an aggregated summary report of these results and making recommendations for improvements to the common form application. The executive order does not impair the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, and its implementation is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations.
