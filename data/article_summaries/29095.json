President Donald Trump has requested Congress to consider additional budget amendments for the Department of Defense (DOD) for fiscal year 2018. The amendments include $4.0 billion for missile defeat and defense enhancements against North Korea, $0.7 billion for repairing U.S. Navy ships, and $1.2 billion to support the Administration's South Asia strategy. The funding for missile defense and Navy ship repairs is requested to be designated as an emergency requirement. The budget also includes costs associated with increased troop levels in Afghanistan to support the South Asia strategy. The President also urges Congress to act on the FY 2018 Budget request for $1.6 billion for the border wall within the Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection account.
