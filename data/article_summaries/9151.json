The Inflation Reduction Act signed by President Biden aims to build an economy that benefits working families. It focuses on lowering costs for families, creating good-paying jobs, and growing the economy. The act addresses various areas such as prescription drug costs, healthcare costs, energy costs, and the climate crisis. It also aims to make the tax code fairer by ensuring that millionaires, billionaires, and corporations pay their fair share. The act supports the creation of clean energy jobs and revitalizing American manufacturing. Additionally, it aims to lower healthcare costs by implementing measures such as capping out-of-pocket costs for Medicare recipients and allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for high-cost drugs.
