House Republicans have voted for a partisan bill that would cut funding by 30% for various programs that many hardworking families rely on, including law enforcement, Meals on Wheels, and Head Start. This move goes against the bipartisan agreement that was made just four months ago, and could lead to a government shutdown. If these cuts were to be extended for the entire year, it would have a significant impact on the American people, affecting the economy, communities, and national security.
