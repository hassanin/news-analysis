President Joe Biden has issued an executive order to raise the minimum wage for workers employed on or in connection with federal government contracts to $15.00 per hour. The order aims to promote economy and efficiency in federal procurement by increasing worker productivity and generating higher-quality work. The Secretary of Labor will determine the minimum wage amount for subsequent years, taking into account the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index. The order also includes provisions for tipped workers and enforcement of compliance. The Secretary of Labor will issue regulations to implement the order, and agencies will be required to incorporate the minimum wage clause into contracts and take steps to ensure compliance. The order revokes certain presidential actions and includes severability provisions. It applies to new contracts, contract-like instruments, solicitations, extensions, renewals, and options entered into on or after January 30, 2022. The order encourages agencies to ensure that existing contracts comply with the new minimum wage requirements.
