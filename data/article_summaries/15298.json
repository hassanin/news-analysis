In this statement, the President calls on the Burmese government to immediately and unconditionally release Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy Secretary General and Nobel Peace Prize winner, from detention. He strongly condemns her house arrest and detention, which have been condemned worldwide. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has affirmed that her detention since 2003 is arbitrary and unjustified. The President emphasizes that Aung San Suu Kyi's continued detention and show trial raise doubts about the Burmese regime's commitment to being a responsible member of the international community. He sees this as an opportunity for the government in Burma to demonstrate respect for its own laws and people, work with the National League for Democracy and other opposition groups, and move towards reconciliation. The President praises Aung San Suu Kyi's patriotism, sacrifice, and vision for a democratic and prosperous Burma. He urges the Burmese government to drop all charges against her and release her and other political prisoners, as a step towards restoring its standing in the eyes of the United States and the international community.
