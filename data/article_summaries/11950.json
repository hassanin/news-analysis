In this letter, President Barack Obama informs the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate that he has ordered the deployment of approximately 200 additional U.S. Armed Forces personnel to Iraq. The purpose of this deployment is to reinforce security at the U.S. Embassy, its support facilities, and the Baghdad International Airport. The force consists of additional security forces, rotary-wing aircraft, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support. The President states that this force will remain in Iraq until the security situation improves and that it is equipped for combat if necessary. He justifies this action as necessary to protect U.S. citizens and property, in line with his responsibility to protect U.S. citizens both domestically and abroad, and in furtherance of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The President also mentions that he is providing this report in accordance with the War Powers Resolution, and he appreciates the support of Congress in these actions.
