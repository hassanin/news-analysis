First Lady Michelle Obama will be hosting the White House Turnaround Arts Talent Show on May 25th. The event will feature students and artists from across the country performing at the White House. The students will be joined by Turnaround Artist mentors such as Paula Abdul, Keb’ Mo’, Alfre Woodard, Tim Robbins, Bernie Williams, Charles "Lil Buck" Riley, Citizen Cope, Damian Woetzel, Irvin Mayfield, and Paula Fuga. 

Turnaround Arts is a national program created by the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, in collaboration with the White House, the U.S. Department of Education, the National Endowment for the Arts, and various foundations and corporations. The program aims to empower high-need, low-performing schools by providing them with innovative arts, dance, theater, and music programs, as well as arts integration across subject areas, arts resources, musical instruments, and artist mentors. This approach has been proven to help address broader school challenges and close the achievement gap.

Since its inception in 2011, Turnaround Arts has benefited 27 school districts across 13 states and Washington, DC. In 2014, the First Lady hosted the inaugural White House Turnaround Arts Talent Show. This year, students from various Turnaround Arts programs in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, New York, and Washington, DC will be performing at the White House.
