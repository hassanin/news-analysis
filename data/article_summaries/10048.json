President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of New York due to a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in December 2010. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and emergency protective measures in certain counties. Hazard mitigation measures will also be supported statewide. John Long has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA.
