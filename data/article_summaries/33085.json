The United States government has issued an Executive Order holding the Iranian regime accountable for attacks against American personnel and interests. The order authorizes sanctions against individuals or entities involved in sectors such as construction, manufacturing, textiles, and mining in Iran, as well as those who assist them. These sanctions will have a significant impact on the Iranian economy, including powerful secondary sanctions on foreign financial institutions. The United States accuses Iran of being the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and warns that it will continue to counter Iran's destructive behavior. The statement also emphasizes that Iran will never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon and that the economic sanctions will only be lifted if the Iranian regime changes its behavior. The United States expresses its readiness to embrace peace with those who seek it.
