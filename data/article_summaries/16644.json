President Obama has declared a major disaster in South Carolina due to the impact of Hurricane Matthew. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures in several counties. W. Michael Moore has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Further assessments are being conducted, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated in the future.
