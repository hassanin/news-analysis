President Joe Biden spoke at a campaign rally in Virginia in support of Terry McAuliffe, who is running for governor. Biden praised McAuliffe's previous term as governor and highlighted his accomplishments, such as job creation, investments in education, support for veterans, and gun safety measures. Biden criticized McAuliffe's opponent, Glenn Youngkin, for embracing Donald Trump and his false claims about the 2020 election. He also emphasized the importance of protecting women's rights, expanding pre-K education, improving infrastructure, and addressing issues like affordable childcare and prescription drug costs. Biden urged Virginians to vote early and support McAuliffe and other Democratic candidates.
