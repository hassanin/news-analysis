Second Lady Karen Pence, in her role as Honorary Vice Chairwoman for Sister Cities International, participated in a meeting and cultural presentation of the Youth Ambassador Exchange program between Houston, Texas and Chiba-city, Japan. She met with the Mayor of Chiba-city, five middle school students who had participated in the program, and the teacher who served as their chaperone. The Youth Ambassador Program is considered an important part of the sister city relationship, where middle school students from each city visit the counterpart's city in alternating years. During the meeting, Mrs. Pence heard about the students' visit to Houston, where they met with city officials, attended classes at a middle school, and toured local sights. Mrs. Pence expressed her honor and pleasure in representing the United States and continuing the cultural relationship between the two countries. After the meeting, she visited the Hama-rikyu Gardens in Tokyo and met with Mrs. Akie Abe, wife of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
