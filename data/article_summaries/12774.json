The Republic of the Union of Myanmar, the United States, Japan, Denmark, and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have launched a new Initiative to Promote Fundamental Labor Rights and Practices in Myanmar. The initiative aims to improve Myanmar's labor administration system through a multi-year labor law reform and capacity building plan. It also aims to foster strong relationships among businesses, workers, civil society organizations, and the government through a stakeholder consultative mechanism. The initiative builds upon Myanmar's existing labor reform efforts and is supported by the ILO. The government of Myanmar has established a Technical Committee Cluster on Labor Law Reform and Institutional Capacity Building to develop the labor reform plan with the support of donor partners, stakeholders, and the ILO. The United States is providing initial funding to the ILO for a labor law expert to advise the government on its reform efforts. The initiative participants plan to organize a stakeholder forum in Myanmar in early 2015 to gather input on the development of the labor reform plan. The initiative aims to promote international labor standards, responsible business practices, and sustainable growth and development in Myanmar.
