Vice President Joe Biden has announced that 10,000 transportation projects are now underway in all 50 states and the District of Columbia as a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). These projects, totaling $29.8 billion, are creating jobs across the country. The milestone comes just over a year after the Recovery Act was signed into law and as the spring construction season is beginning. The 10,000th project, the Sanford Bypass in North Carolina, will break ground and is expected to hire more than 45 employees. The project, which was accelerated by the Recovery Act, aims to redirect commercial truck traffic away from the city of Sanford, relieving congestion and maintenance problems. In addition to the 10,000 projects already underway, construction activity is expected to increase further in the coming months. The Recovery Act has already improved more than 33,000 miles of pavement, helped purchase nearly 12,000 buses and rail vehicles, and constructed or renovated over 850 transit facilities. The U.S. Department of Transportation has successfully committed funds to specific projects, allowing contracts to be bid, workers to be hired, and construction to begin. Other major Recovery Act-funded projects include the I-4/Selmon Expressway in Tampa, the DART Orange Line in Dallas, the Nelsonville Bypass in Southeast Ohio, the Merritt Parkway near Fairfield, Connecticut, and the South Westnedge Avenue Interchange on I-94 near Kalamazoo, Michigan.
