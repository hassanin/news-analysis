On October 31, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring the continuation of a national emergency with respect to Sudan. The national emergency was initially declared on November 3, 1997, due to the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan that posed a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Over the years, additional executive orders were issued to address the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region and to implement the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006. Despite some positive developments, the crisis caused by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan has not been resolved and continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States. Therefore, President Trump determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency. The notice of this decision will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
