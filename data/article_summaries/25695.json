This article discusses a Presidential Memoranda issued by President Donald J. Trump on January 9, 2018. The memorandum orders the Director of National Intelligence to develop and release publicly a policy requiring each element of the Intelligence Community to develop procedures for responding to requests from government officials for non-public identity information about known unconsenting United States persons that was originally omitted from disseminated intelligence reports. The procedures developed should supplement existing procedures for the collection, retention, and dissemination of information concerning United States persons, as well as any other procedures required by law. The Director of National Intelligence is prohibited from modifying or superseding the issued guidance without notifying the President and allowing 30 days for review. The memorandum provides definitions for the terms "Intelligence Community" and "United States person" based on Executive Order 12333.
