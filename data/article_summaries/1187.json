This article discusses a memorandum issued by President Joe Biden to increase access to justice in the United States. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of equal justice under the law and highlights the need for legal services to ensure fair administration of laws and public programs. It mentions the establishment of the Office for Access to Justice in 2016 and the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable (LAIR) in 2012 to address access to justice issues. The article also highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to justice and the need to strengthen access in the 21st century. The memorandum directs the Department of Justice (DOJ) to expand its access-to-justice function and submit a report outlining the plan within 120 days. It also reconvenes LAIR as a White House initiative and outlines its mission and responsibilities, including improving coordination among federal programs, increasing access to justice, and advancing evidence-based research. The memorandum encourages the participation of various executive departments, agencies, and offices in LAIR and requires annual reports on its progress. The DOJ will provide support services for LAIR, and the LAIR members will serve without additional compensation. The memorandum contains general provisions regarding its implementation and publication.
