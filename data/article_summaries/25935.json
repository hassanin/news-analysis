In a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, President Donald Trump proposes an alternative plan for pay increases for civilian Federal employees. He states that pay adjustments for Federal employees have been lower in recent years due to fiscal constraints and the need to put the nation on a sustainable fiscal course. Under current law, a 1.9 percent across-the-board increase for the base General Schedule and locality pay increases averaging 26.16 percent would go into effect in January 2018, costing $26 billion. President Trump deems this increase unwarranted and determines that the across-the-board pay increases for 2018 will be 1.4 percent, with locality pay increases averaging 0.5 percent, resulting in an overall average increase of 1.9 percent for civilian Federal employees. The specified locality pay percentages will be outlined in an Executive Order before the first pay period in January 2018. President Trump assures that these adjustments will not significantly impact the ability to attract and retain a well-qualified Federal workforce.
