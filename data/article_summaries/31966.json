President Trump and Secretary Azar visited the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIH) to discuss progress on developing a potential vaccine for the novel coronavirus. The President was informed that the FDA has authorized the vaccine to enter phase one safety clinical trials, which is a record time frame. Dr. Fauci explained that the vaccine development process will take at least a year to a year and a half, including additional phases of testing. The President also discussed the difference between testing a vaccine and testing therapeutic drugs, with the latter having a shorter time frame for results. The President expressed interest in middle-income tax cuts and mentioned that he would consider a payroll tax cut if approved by Democrats. When asked about concerns regarding travel, the President suggested that there are plenty of great travel destinations within the United States. The President also commented on the stock market drop and expressed the opinion that the Federal Reserve should do more to address the situation.
