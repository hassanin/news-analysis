In a meeting with Democratic governors, President Biden discussed the need to protect women's rights after the recent Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. He highlighted the impact of the decision on women's health and safety and expressed his frustration with the extremist Court that he believes is moving America backwards. President Biden announced two specific actions to protect women's rights: using the federal government to protect women who need to travel to seek medical help and ensuring access to FDA-approved medication. He also emphasized the need for Congress to codify Roe into federal law and called for support in the upcoming elections to elect federal Senators and Representatives who will protect women's rights. The governors shared the actions they have taken in their respective states to protect reproductive rights and discussed additional measures that could be taken at the federal level, such as funding for family planning services and the use of federal facilities to provide access to care. The governors stressed the importance of protecting privacy rights beyond just reproductive rights, including issues like marriage equality. President Biden expressed his commitment to using the power of the federal government to prevent obstruction and ensure access to care. He also recognized the role of governors in defending women's rights and urged everyone to work together to protect women's health and rights.
