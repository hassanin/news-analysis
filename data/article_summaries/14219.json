The article is a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. In the letter, Obama reports that he has issued an Executive Order expanding the scope of a national emergency declared in 2008 regarding North Korea. The order takes additional steps to address the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. The order targets the international network that supports the North Korean government through arms sales and illicit economic activities, including money laundering, counterfeiting, smuggling, and narcotics trafficking. It also imposes sanctions on individuals and entities involved in these activities. The order does not target the people of North Korea or those providing legitimate humanitarian relief. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is delegated the authority to take necessary actions to implement the order. All executive agencies of the United States Government are directed to carry out the provisions of the order. The order became effective on August 30, 2010.
