On May 20, 1997, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13047, declaring a national emergency with respect to Burma. This was done in response to the Government of Burma's large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in the country. The national emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by the actions and policies of the Burmese government. The national emergency and the measures adopted to deal with it have been in effect since May 20, 1997, and will continue to be in effect beyond May 20, 2015. This continuation is necessary because the actions and policies of the Burmese government still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
