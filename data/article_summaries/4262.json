Access to high-speed internet is now considered a necessity rather than a luxury. However, many students and families struggle to afford it, leading to a digital divide. To address this issue, President Biden and Vice President Harris worked with bipartisan support to include the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The ACP, administered by the FCC, offers eligible households up to $30/month off internet bills and a one-time discount of up to $100 off a device. Additionally, internet service providers have committed to offering high-speed internet plans fully covered by the ACP. To further promote internet access and affordability, Civic Nation and the U.S. Department of Education are launching the Online For All campaign. This campaign aims to close the digital divide by working with various stakeholders to educate communities about the benefits of the Biden-Harris Internet for All Initiative. The campaign will kick off with a Week of Action to drive enrollment in the ACP, as many eligible Americans are still unaware of the program. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to reaching qualified Americans and ensuring the program's longevity. Over 300 organizations are participating in the Week of Action to raise awareness and help eligible families sign up. The goal is to connect all communities in the United States to affordable high-speed internet as part of President Biden's Investing in America agenda. This includes funding for internet deployment in rural areas and the forthcoming Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program.
