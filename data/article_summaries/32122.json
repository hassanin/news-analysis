The Trump economy has led to positive outcomes in terms of household income, poverty rates, and job opportunities in the United States. According to the Census Bureau, median household income rose in 2018, reaching its highest level since 1999. The poverty rate also dropped to its lowest level since 2001. Additionally, a Washington Post analysis found that for the first time, most new hires in the US are people of color, with minority women driving this trend. This is attributed to a tight labor market and increased demand in industries with a high number of female workers. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic women, and Asian Americans have also reached record lows. Furthermore, under the Trump administration, over 6 million individuals have discontinued their participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) since 2017.
