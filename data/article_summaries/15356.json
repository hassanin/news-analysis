In this statement, the President expresses his support for the passage of the STOCK Act, which aims to prevent members of Congress from engaging in insider trading. He urges the House of Representatives to pass the bill and states that he will sign it immediately. The President also highlights the need for further actions, such as prohibiting elected officials from owning stocks in industries they impact and restricting people who bundle campaign contributions from lobbying Congress. These proposals are seen as ways to reduce the negative influence of money in politics.
