On November 21, 2013, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 2747, transfers authority from the Government Accountability Office to the Department of Labor for processing and disbursing back wages owed to employees of Federal contractors who violated certain Federal wage requirements. The second bill, S. 330, lifts the ban on transplantation of organs infected with HIV, establishes criteria and quality standards for research and transplantation of such organs, and allows an exception to a Federal criminal prohibition on the donation or sale of HIV infected organs. The third bill, S. 893, provides a cost-of-living adjustment for the beneficiaries of veterans' disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation, equal to the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment.
