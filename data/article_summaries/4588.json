President Biden has declared a major disaster in the State of Oklahoma due to severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes that occurred from April 19 to April 20, 2023. This declaration allows for federal funding to supplement recovery efforts in the affected areas. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Adam D. Burpee of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations. Damage assessments are ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated after assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance through the FEMA website, phone, or app. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
