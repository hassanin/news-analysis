The Biden-Harris Administration has released a playbook on evidence-based workforce development strategies for state and local governments to support workers, families, and communities. The administration's economic vision, known as Bidenomics, aims to grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up by investing in America, supporting industries like semiconductors and clean energy, empowering workers, and fostering fair and competitive markets. The goal is to create jobs across the country, including in communities that have been left behind. The administration's investments in new industries will require a skilled workforce, and while training efforts like Registered Apprenticeships are important, job quality is also crucial in attracting and retaining workers. Decades of offshoring, wage stagnation, lack of benefits, and anti-union activity have reduced the quality of jobs in industries like construction and manufacturing. By improving job quality, employers can attract and retain workers, leading to increased productivity and economic growth. Unions also play a central role in developing and training the workforce. The administration's policies encourage private sector actors to create high-quality jobs and prioritize worker empowerment and unionization. Employers who pay prevailing wages and use Registered Apprenticeships for clean energy projects will receive enhanced tax credits. The administration has also invested in worker-centered sectoral training efforts and updated regulations to strengthen wage rates on federally funded construction projects. By investing in workers and improving job quality, employers can ensure the benefits of the administration's agenda are shared by all Americans.
