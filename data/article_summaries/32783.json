The United States has been a development partner of Cambodia for the past 25 years, contributing over $1 billion to improve the country's economy, society, and democracy. However, recent setbacks to democracy, particularly the Senate elections on February 25, have raised concerns. As a result, the United States has decided to review its assistance to Cambodia to ensure that American taxpayer funds are not being used to support anti-democratic behavior. As a result of this review, several Treasury, USAID, and military assistance programs will be suspended or curtailed. These programs were intended to support the General Department of Taxation, local government authorities, and the Cambodian military, all of which have been linked to the setbacks in democracy. However, the United States will continue to support projects in areas such as health, agriculture, mine clearance, civil society promotion, and other important areas for the Cambodian people.
