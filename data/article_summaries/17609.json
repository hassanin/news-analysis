The article highlights the achievements of the High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) between the United States and Mexico over the past three years. The HLED, co-chaired by Vice President Joe Biden and Mexico's Secretary of Finance and Public Credit, has focused on various economic and commercial issues, including modernizing borders, energy cooperation, workforce development, entrepreneurship and innovation, regulatory cooperation, and regional and global leadership.

Some of the achievements mentioned in the article include the modernization of shared border infrastructure, such as the Cross Border Xpress and the Pedestrian West Facility at the San Ysidro-El Chaparral Port of Entry. The HLED has also worked towards improving coordination on border crossing infrastructure priorities and customs and trade facilitation procedures. Additionally, the agreement has led to the establishment of new passenger and cargo routes between the two countries.

In terms of energy cooperation, the U.S. and Mexico have established the U.S.-Mexico Energy Business Council and developed an integrated trilateral energy information platform. They have also strengthened their energy and environmental cooperation through various agreements and negotiations.

The HLED has also focused on workforce development, partnering in education through the Bilateral Forum on Higher Education, Innovation, and Research. It has facilitated student and teacher exchanges and increased cross-border enrollment.

Entrepreneurship and innovation have been recognized as central to economic growth, and the U.S.-Mexico Entrepreneurship and Innovation Council has played a role in promoting investment and trade opportunities. The HLED has also worked on promoting women's entrepreneurship and their full integration into the regional economy.

In terms of regional and global leadership, both countries have been involved in promoting transparency, citizen participation, and strengthening governance through initiatives like the Open Government Partnership. Mexico has taken the lead in coordinating regional electricity and natural gas integration with Central America, supporting clean energy generation and economic development.

Stakeholder engagement has been a priority, with private sector representatives participating in the U.S.-Mexico CEO Dialogue to have a positive impact on HLED initiatives.

Looking ahead, the article emphasizes the plan to continue promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth, job creation, and competitiveness. The goal is to bring tangible benefits to the citizens of both countries by broadening outreach to stakeholders, particularly the private sector, civil society, and academia.
