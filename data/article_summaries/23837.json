President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Nebraska due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred in May 2014. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding is available for emergency work, as well as the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Clay, Fillmore, Saline, Saunders, Seward, and York are eligible for this funding. In addition, hazard mitigation measures statewide can also receive federal funding. Christian Mark Van Alstyne has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
