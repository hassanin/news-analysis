Vice President Kamala Harris recently hosted a meeting at the White House with 75 student leaders from colleges and universities across 33 states to address the fight for reproductive rights. The student leaders discussed the impact of restricted abortion laws on their campuses and communities, as well as the confusion it creates for individuals seeking reproductive health services. They also highlighted the intersectionality of attacks on abortion access, voting rights, and LGBTQI+ rights, emphasizing the need for coalitions to defend these rights and freedoms. The conversation also touched on supporting survivors of sexual violence on college campuses and improving access to stigma-free healthcare. Concerns were raised about access to contraception on campus and the ability to travel out-of-state for reproductive care. Vice President Harris commended the student leaders for their efforts and encouraged them to continue fighting for reproductive freedom. This meeting is part of a larger initiative by the Vice President to bring together leaders from various backgrounds to protect reproductive health care and abortion access. She has engaged with reproductive rights leaders in Connecticut and Texas, chaired the Interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, and held numerous other meetings with stakeholders, including state legislators, health care providers, faith leaders, and advocates.
