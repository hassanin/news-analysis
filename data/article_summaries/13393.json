This article is a presidential memorandum issued by President Barack Obama in 2014. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of civil society in democratic governance and highlights the role of civil society organizations in driving innovation and addressing social, economic, and political challenges. It acknowledges that the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association are essential for civil society to participate fully in society. However, it also recognizes that these rights are under threat in many parts of the world, with governments inhibiting the operation of civil society and restricting their access to funding. The memorandum calls for greater international efforts to support and defend civil society and directs agencies engaged abroad to strengthen the role of civil society, challenge restrictions, and promote constructive engagement between governments and civil society. It also outlines specific actions to be taken by agencies, such as engaging in consultation with civil society representatives, working with civil society organizations despite local restrictions, opposing undue restrictions on civil society and fundamental freedoms, facilitating exchanges between governments and civil society, and reporting on progress. The memorandum concludes with general provisions and clarifies that it should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
