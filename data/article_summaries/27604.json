It highlights the threats posed by street gangs to communities and the well-being of children, teenagers, and families, including human trafficking, drug smuggling, property destruction, corruption of youth, and business ruin. The proclamation mentions Operation LeGend, a law enforcement surge launched in July to combat gang violence and protect children from violent crime. It also discusses the Department of Justice's efforts to prosecute violent gang members, disrupt transnational criminal organizations such as MS-13, secure borders, shut down smuggling networks, and expedite the removal of illegal immigrants associated with these criminal networks. The proclamation recognizes the importance of the Project Safe Neighborhoods program in supporting local law enforcement agencies in combating gang violence. It expresses gratitude and support for law enforcement officials and calls for unity in the fight against criminal gangs. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to observe National Gang Violence Prevention Week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
