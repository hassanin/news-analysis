Governor Jim Douglas of Vermont expresses his support for the tax compromise reached by President Obama and Congressional Republicans. He believes that both parties need to work together and avoid an all-or-nothing approach to governing. Governor Douglas sees the compromise as a reasonable way to assist the American people during difficult times without burdening the recovery with tax increases. He hopes that this collaboration can be built upon to address the national debt, which he sees as the most critical issue for the long-term economic health of the nation.
