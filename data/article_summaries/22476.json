President Obama is calling on Congress to extend unemployment insurance to millions of Americans who are still struggling to find work. The U.S. Senate will vote on extending unemployment benefits for those affected by the recession. Senate Republicans have previously blocked the extension of emergency relief for the unemployed. The President highlighted that many Republicans have supported unemployment extensions in the past but refuse to offer relief to middle-class families now. The article includes stories of three Americans in need of the extension. The President urges Congress to pass the unemployment insurance extension and not hold workers hostage to politics. The Republicans' refusal to act has already blocked assistance to 2.5 million Americans, and there are concerns about weak consumer demand impacting small businesses. Extending unemployment benefits can help stimulate the economy.
