President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring September 13-19, 2020, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. In the proclamation, he highlights his commitment to fostering an environment where all businesses, including minority-owned businesses, can thrive. He mentions the historic 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which provided tax cuts and reforms, benefiting all Americans and creating Opportunity Zones to encourage investment in distressed communities and create jobs. The administration has also cut burdensome regulations to allow minority-owned businesses to thrive. The Department of Commerce has announced the creation of the Minority Business Enterprise Inner City Innovation HUBs, which will award $2.8 million over 2 years to support minority-owned businesses. The administration has allocated $10 million in supplemental funding to MBDA Business Centers and minority chambers of commerce to provide training and advising services for minority business enterprises as part of the CARES Act. The Opportunity Zones created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act have generated $75 billion in investment for minority neighborhoods. The administration is committed to supporting minority businesses as the nation continues its economic recovery. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to observe this week with programs, ceremonies, and activities to recognize the contributions of American minority business enterprises.
