President Biden will announce new actions to accelerate the vaccination process in the United States. By April 19, 90% of adults in the country will be eligible for vaccination, and 90% will have access to a vaccination site within 5 miles of their residence. The administration plans to increase the number of pharmacies in the federal pharmacy vaccination program from 17,000 to nearly 40,000 nationwide. Additionally, a dozen more mass vaccination sites will be established by April 19. The President will also allocate nearly $100 million to fund community organizations that will provide transportation and assistance to vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities for accessing vaccines. The aim is to reach those who are at the highest risk and have not yet been vaccinated. President Biden emphasizes the importance of continuing preventive measures such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing, as new variants of the virus continue to spread and cases are on the rise.
