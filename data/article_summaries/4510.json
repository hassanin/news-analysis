President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536 with respect to Somalia will continue beyond April 12, 2023. This decision is based on the belief that the situation in Somalia still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
