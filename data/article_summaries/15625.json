The White House has announced a series of initiatives aimed at reducing recidivism and promoting the reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals. These initiatives include the Second Chance Pell Pilot Program, which will provide educational and training programs to incarcerated students; the Reentry Demonstration Project for Young Adults, which will provide job training and employment opportunities for adults ages 18 to 24; and the Training to Work program, which offers career pathway programs for individuals in high-poverty and high-crime areas. Other initiatives include the Linking to Employment Activities Pre-Release program, which helps soon-to-be-released inmates with employment preparation, and the Pathways to Justice program, which provides mentorship and career training to at-risk youth. The Department of Housing and Urban Development and Department of Justice have also awarded grants to address homelessness and incarceration, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development has released a toolkit for reentry housing programs. Additionally, the Department of Justice will support the development of family strengthening policies for incarcerated parents, and the Administration has taken steps to improve reentry outcomes and remove barriers for formerly incarcerated individuals, such as establishing the Federal Interagency Reentry Council and calling on the private sector to create job opportunities for them.
