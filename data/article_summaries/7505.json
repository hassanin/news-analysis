The United States and the United Arab Emirates have formed a new Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) to promote clean energy and combat climate change. The partnership aims to catalyze $100 billion in clean energy financing and commercial investment in both countries, as well as support clean development in emerging economies. The goal is to deploy 100 gigawatts of clean energy globally by 2035, focusing on low-emission energy sources, carbon and methane management, advanced nuclear technology, and decarbonization of industrial and transportation sectors. The President thanked Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan for his leadership in advancing this initiative and for hosting COP28 in 2023. This partnership demonstrates the strong strategic relationship between the two countries and the U.S. commitment to promoting economic prosperity, security, and stability in the Middle East region.
