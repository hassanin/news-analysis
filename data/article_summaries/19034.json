The article discusses President Obama's proposals for building a 21st-century retirement system. The President emphasizes the need for Americans to have the ability to save for retirement and take their savings with them as they move from job to job. The current retirement landscape is changing, with fewer workers having traditional pensions and more responsibility falling on individuals to save for their retirement. 

The President's proposals aim to increase access to workplace retirement savings accounts and make retirement benefits more portable. The proposals include expanding access to retirement savings opportunities by encouraging more employers to offer plans and making it easier for workers to participate. This includes enabling small businesses to create pooled 401(k) plans, automatically enrolling workers without access to a workplace plan in an IRA, providing tax credits for small businesses that offer retirement plans, and allowing long-term, part-time workers to participate in their employer's plan.

The President also proposes to make retirement benefits more portable by piloting innovative approaches to provide retirement and other employment-based benefits that can be carried across employers. Additionally, efforts are being made to make it easier for workers to consolidate their retirement savings from multiple employers and to ensure that retirement savers receive advice in their best interest.

The article also mentions existing efforts by the Administration to expand retirement savings options, such as facilitating state efforts to create their own retirement savings programs, launching the myRA savings option, and proposing rules to ensure retirement advisers make recommendations in their customers' best interest.

Overall, the President's proposals aim to increase access to retirement savings accounts, make retirement benefits more portable, and provide workers with the resources to enjoy their retirement after a lifetime of hard work.
