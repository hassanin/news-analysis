The Obama Administration is praising the passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act by the House of Representatives, which aims to fix the No Child Left Behind Act. The bill rejects the overuse of standardized tests and one-size-fits-all mandates, and focuses on preparing every child for college and careers. It also provides more children access to high-quality state preschool programs. The bill holds all students to high academic standards, ensures accountability for underperforming schools, empowers state and local decision-makers, reduces testing burden, and establishes new resources for reform and better outcomes. It upholds critical protections for disadvantaged students and ensures equitable access to excellent educators. The bill affirms college and career-ready standards, requires rigorous accountability for all students, targets resources to struggling schools, and includes initiatives to improve opportunities and outcomes. It promotes a balanced approach to testing and encourages equity in state and local funding. The bill also rejects harmful provisions that would siphon funds away from needy students and schools.
