The Biden-Harris administration will be making forthcoming announcements on climate security. The administration is prioritizing addressing the climate crisis as a core element of national security and foreign policy. Tomorrow, several reports will be released by various government agencies, including the National Intelligence Estimate on Climate Change, the Department of Defense's Climate Risk Analysis, the Department of Homeland Security's Strategic Framework to Address Climate Change, and an assessment on the impact of climate change on migration. These reports aim to provide a foundation for addressing climate and security challenges and highlight the need for global cooperation in tackling climate change. The reports emphasize the risks of climate change to national security, including increased geopolitical tension, cross-border conflicts, and strains on country-level stability. The administration is focused on taking evidence-based action guided by science and data. The reports will be released tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. EDT.
