In this article, President Biden discusses the importance of state and local officials' leadership in protecting reproductive rights. He expresses his belief that the Supreme Court got Roe v. Wade right for almost 50 years and advocates for Congress to codify it into law. He acknowledges that they are currently short of the necessary votes in the Senate and emphasizes the importance of the American people making their voices heard in the upcoming November elections. The President also mentions that he has signed two executive orders to protect access to reproductive healthcare, including emergency medical care, and to safeguard a woman's right to travel for necessary healthcare. He highlights a recent district court win in Idaho and expresses his optimism for progress on this issue. The article then includes statements from Mayor O'Neal of Durham, North Carolina, who calls for a broader conversation on reproductive freedoms for men, and Judge Hidalgo from Harris County, Texas, who discusses the negative impact of the new abortion law in Texas and calls for support in accessing safe havens for women seeking abortion. The President agrees with their concerns and emphasizes that this issue goes beyond partisan lines and is a slap in the face to women's equality. The article concludes with the President acknowledging that he may have interrupted someone and the conversation transitioning to a closed press setting.
