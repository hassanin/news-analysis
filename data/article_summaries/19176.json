On October 27, 2006, President Obama declared a national emergency with respect to the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This was done in response to the widespread violence and atrocities occurring in the country, which threatened regional stability and posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. The President took further action in 2014 to address this national emergency. Now, in 2016, the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to pose a threat to the foreign policy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency declared in 2006, as well as the measures taken to address it, will continue to be in effect beyond October 27, 2016. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
