On March 27, 2018, the President signed three new laws. The first law, H.R. 2154, renames the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota, as the Edward T. Schafer Agricultural Research Center. The second law, S. 188, called the "Eliminating Government-funded Oil-painting Act," prohibits the use of Federal funds to paint portraits of officers and employees of the Federal Government. The third law, S. 324, known as the "State Veteran Home Adult Day Health Care Improvement Act of 2017," requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to expand alternative services for veterans eligible for nursing home care.
