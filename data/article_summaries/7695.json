President Biden will release 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) as part of efforts to lower gas prices and address the lack of supply. The release is in response to the mismatch between global oil supply and demand as the economy recovers from the pandemic. The SPR release will include an exchange mechanism where market participants will take oil now and return it later when prices are lower, with additional oil coming into the SPR. The release is expected to begin in mid-to-late December. The administration is also focused on addressing consolidation in the oil and gas sector, which may be leading to anti-competitive practices that prevent lower oil prices from reaching consumers. President Biden has asked the Federal Trade Commission to examine the issue. The administration is committed to supporting the economic recovery, making oil and gas affordable, and achieving clean energy goals. The release of oil from the SPR is being coordinated with other major energy-consuming nations. The administration is in close communication with major producing countries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, and OPEC nations, and hopes they will continue to take action to stabilize the market. The administration expects consumers to see relief at the pump soon, as oil prices have already fallen by nearly 10 percent in recent weeks. The administration will continue to monitor the market and take additional action if necessary.
