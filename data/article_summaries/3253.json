The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Biden, aims to build an economy that benefits working families, including Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander families. It focuses on lowering prescription drug costs, healthcare costs, and energy costs. The act also addresses the climate crisis, reduces the deficit, and asks the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share of taxes. It ensures that those making under $400,000 per year won't see an increase in taxes. The act aims to lower healthcare costs by improving prescription drug coverage and expanding health insurance coverage for AA and NHPI families. It also focuses on combating climate change and lowering energy costs, particularly for vulnerable communities. The act promotes energy efficiency and the creation of clean energy jobs, while protecting public health and strengthening resilience to climate change. Additionally, the act includes provisions to lower costs for small businesses and make the tax code fairer by raising revenue and ensuring that the rich and powerful are held accountable.
