The Second Lady, Karen Pence, delivered remarks in Texas applauding the efforts to address military spouse unemployment. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Hiring Our Heroes has designated Texas as a Military Spouse Economic Empowerment Zone (MSEEZ), joining five other states. This designation will create a network of business leaders, educational institutions, and government officials to provide employment opportunities for military spouses. Mrs. Pence emphasized the importance of military spouse employment and highlighted the positive impact of MSEEZs in San Antonio and El Paso. MSEEZs are a nationwide initiative that aims to establish meaningful employment opportunities for military spouses through collaboration between the public and private sector.
