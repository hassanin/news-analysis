National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met with civil society leaders to discuss China's draft foreign NGO law. The discussion focused on concerns that the law would restrict civil society in China, hinder the work of international and domestic NGOs, and limit people-to-people exchanges between the US and China. The participants highlighted issues with the registration and reporting requirements in the draft legislation, as well as the broad powers given to the Chinese public security bureau. Rice expressed the US government's concern about the draft law and emphasized the importance of a vibrant civil society for a prosperous and stable society.
