The President of the United States, Barack Obama, has sent a message to the Senate regarding the Bilateral Tax Agreement with Luxembourg. He is requesting the Senate's advice and consent for the ratification of the Protocol Amending the Convention between the United States and Luxembourg for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital. This protocol aims to enhance the exchange of information between tax authorities in the two countries, following the current U.S. Model Income Tax Convention and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development standards for the exchange of tax information. President Obama recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the proposed protocol and related agreement.
