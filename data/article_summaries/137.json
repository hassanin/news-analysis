The article highlights the achievements and goals of the writer's administration regarding healthcare in the United States. Since taking office, over 4.6 million Americans have gained health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, over 13.6 million Americans signed up for coverage from November 1st to December 15th, marking a record enrollment. The writer emphasizes the importance of healthcare as a right and not a privilege.

The article attributes the increased enrollment to expanded access and actions taken by the administration to lower healthcare costs. The American Rescue Plan has made quality coverage through the ACA more affordable, with families saving an average of $2,400 on annual premiums. The writer acknowledges that despite these achievements, there are still Americans who struggle with the cost of healthcare, and more work needs to be done.

The writer introduces the Build Back Better Act as a solution to further expand coverage and lower costs. The act aims to reduce premiums for over nine million Americans, cover four million Americans in states that haven't expanded Medicaid, expand Medicare to include hearing coverage, lower prescription drug costs, and decrease the price of insulin. The writer expresses the intention to pass the Build Back Better Act, cut healthcare costs, and provide greater peace of mind to American families in the coming year.
