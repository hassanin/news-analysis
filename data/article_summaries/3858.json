President Joe Biden will hold a virtual bilateral meeting with Miche√°l Martin, the Taoiseach of Ireland, on March 17. The meeting will focus on strengthening the partnership between the United States and Ireland, as well as addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and global challenges. They will also discuss promoting shared prosperity and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland. While the pandemic prevents the usual White House celebration of St. Patrick's Day, efforts will be made to commemorate the holiday and the close relationship with Ireland in a safe manner.
