The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken an important step towards making 21st-century classrooms available to every student in America. This is part of the ConnectED initiative, which aims to provide schools with the infrastructure and tools needed to deliver competitive digital education to all students in the United States. The goal is to get 99% of America's students connected to the Internet through high-speed broadband and high-speed wireless within 5 years. The initiative has widespread support from Republicans, Democrats, educators, business and tech leaders, and state and local officials.
