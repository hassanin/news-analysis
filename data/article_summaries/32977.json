President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, with respect to Ukraine, is to continue beyond March 6, 2020. The president believes that the actions and policies of individuals undermining democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine, as well as the actions of the Russian government, including the annexation of Crimea and the use of force in Ukraine, pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
