The G-20 summit in Seoul issued a statement on development that includes principles and a comprehensive multi-year Plan of Action. The plan focuses on infrastructure, trade, human resource development, private sector investment, job creation, food security, domestic resource mobilization, knowledge sharing, and growth with resilience. The G-20's development plan aims to enable low-income countries to mobilize domestic resources and attract private investment for sustainable economic growth. The U.S. global development policy, announced by President Obama in September 2010, aligns with the G-20 approach and emphasizes the role of the private sector and accountable leadership. Both the U.S. policy and the G-20 plan aim to reduce dependence on foreign assistance by mobilizing foreign investment and domestic capital. The G-20 recognizes the importance of narrowing the development gap for a strong global economy and emphasizes a partnership among developed, emerging market, and developing countries. The G-20 also aims to address regional challenges to development and improve growth prospects in developing countries through multilateral institutions. The United States will work to effectively leverage its development resources and achieve better economic growth outcomes in line with the G-20 plan and its own global development policy.
