The Biden-Harris Administration is taking steps to address bias in home valuations and promote homeownership opportunities for all Americans. Two years ago, on the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, President Biden created the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) to tackle bias in the home appraisal process. The Task Force has developed the PAVE Action Plan, which includes a comprehensive set of actions to advance equity and eliminate racial and ethnic bias in home valuations. Since its release in March 2022, the Administration has made progress in implementing the Action Plan. This includes empowering consumers with tools to address appraisal bias, using data to identify trends and crack down on offenders, and supporting a well-trained and diverse appraiser profession. On the anniversary of the creation of the PAVE Task Force and the start of National Homeownership Month, the Administration is announcing additional actions to fulfill the PAVE Action Plan and ensure equal opportunities for all Americans to build generational wealth through homeownership.
