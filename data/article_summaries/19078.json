This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor. The national emergency was declared in 2004 due to the actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others, which undermined Liberia's transition to democracy and the development of its institutions and resources. Despite Liberia's progress in promoting democracy and the conviction of Charles Taylor for war crimes, his actions and policies still pose a threat to the foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency and the measures adopted to deal with it will continue for another year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
