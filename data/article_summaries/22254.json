President Obama has announced the launch of the National HIV/AIDS Community Discussions, a series of events to be held across the country. These events will offer the public a chance to provide input as the White House works to develop a National HIV/AIDS Strategy. The first event, the Atlanta HIV/AIDS Community Discussion, will be held on August 25th at the 2009 National HIV Prevention Conference. The goal of the strategy is to reduce HIV incidence, increase access to care, optimize health outcomes, and reduce HIV-related health disparities. The discussions will involve input from the public, as well as the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS and local HIV services organizations. Other cities where community discussions will be held include Washington, DC; New York, NY; San Francisco, CA; Houston, TX; and Puerto Rico.
