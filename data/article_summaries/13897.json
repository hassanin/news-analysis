The article discusses Executive Order 13491, issued by President Barack Obama on January 22, 2009. The order revokes Executive Order 13440, which was issued in 2007. It also revokes any executive directives, orders, and regulations inconsistent with the new order, including those issued by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) regarding detention and interrogation of individuals from September 11, 2001, to January 20, 2009. The order aims to improve the effectiveness of intelligence-gathering, ensure the lawful and humane treatment of individuals in custody, and comply with treaty obligations, including the Geneva Conventions. It establishes standards and practices for the interrogation of individuals in United States custody, based on Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and the Army Field Manuals 2-22.3 and 34-52. The order also prohibits certain detention facilities and grants the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detained individuals. Additionally, it establishes a Special Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies to review and evaluate interrogation and transfer practices. The task force is required to provide a report to the President on its findings within 180 days. The order emphasizes that it does not diminish any rights individuals may have under relevant laws and treaties and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
