The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to help uninsured Americans gain coverage. Despite the Affordable Care Act's coverage provisions, 10.5 million eligible individuals remain uninsured. The challenge aims to engage communities with high numbers or percentages of uninsured individuals and encourage them to build outreach efforts. At the end of the open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare new Marketplace signups to estimates of eligible uninsured individuals to determine which communities made the most progress. The victorious community will receive recognition, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama. Tampa, Florida is one of the 20 communities participating in the challenge. The fact sheet also provides information on health insurance coverage in Tampa, including the affordability of plans, tax credits, and the number of issuers offering individual health plans. Despite progress, there is still work to be done to cover the uninsured in Tampa and the surrounding region, where there are 231,000 eligible uninsured individuals.
