The United States strongly condemns North Korea's recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, which violates multiple UN Security Council resolutions. Although the test did not pose an immediate threat to the US or its allies, it raises tensions and risks destabilizing the region. This demonstrates that North Korea prioritizes its weapons programs over the well-being of its people. The US urges all countries to condemn these violations and calls on North Korea to stop its destabilizing actions and engage in dialogue. The US is coordinating closely with its allies and will take necessary measures to ensure security.
