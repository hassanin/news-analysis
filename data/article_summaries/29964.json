Second Lady Karen Pence recently visited Cairo and participated in a discussion about the need for more art therapists in Egypt. Currently, there is only one trained art therapist in the country, and there is no program available for people to study art therapy. Mrs. Pence met with the only practicing art therapist in Egypt and the founder of the Wellness Hub, where art therapy is provided to clients. She hopes that her visit and discussion will raise awareness about the need for more art therapists in Egypt. Mrs. Pence has chosen art therapy as her initiative and calls it "Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART." Art therapy is an integrative mental health profession that uses art-making and creative processes to enrich the lives of individuals, families, and communities. Professional art therapists facilitate art therapy using psychological and counseling techniques.
