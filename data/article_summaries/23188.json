This article is a press release from the White House, dated October 31, 2011. It discusses Executive Order 13588, which aims to reduce prescription drug shortages in the United States. The order states that pharmaceutical drug shortages pose a serious threat to public health, and the number of shortages has tripled between 2005 and 2010. These shortages include critical drugs for cancer treatments, anesthesia, and other life-threatening conditions. The FDA has been working to address this issue through its existing regulatory framework but has faced challenges. One factor contributing to shortages is an increase in demand that exceeds manufacturing capacity. The order directs the FDA to take steps to prevent and reduce disruptions in the supply of lifesaving medicines. This includes requiring drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of manufacturing discontinuances and expediting regulatory reviews to avoid or mitigate shortages. The FDA is also instructed to communicate any findings of stockpiling or exorbitant pricing to the Department of Justice, which will determine if enforcement actions are necessary. The order emphasizes that it does not impair existing authorities or create enforceable rights.
