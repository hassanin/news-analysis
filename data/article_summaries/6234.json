On December 17, 1903, the Wright Brothers achieved the first sustained, controlled, powered flight, marking a significant milestone in human history. Their innovation and bravery led to the birth of modern aviation and inspired generations of Americans to explore the skies. Since then, America has continued to lead in flight, breaking records and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Today, the United States is developing sustainable fuels, technologies to manage air traffic, and satellite systems to clean up space debris. The recent Perseverance mission by NASA successfully launched the Ingenuity rotorcraft on Mars, marking the first powered, controlled takeoff and landing on another planet. This mission also paid tribute to the Wright Brothers by carrying a small piece of cloth from the original Wright Flyer. As we celebrate Wright Brothers Day on December 17, 2021, we honor the pioneers in flight and space technology who continue to connect people and communities around the world.
