During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced that President Trump has decided to revoke the security clearance of John Brennan, the former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Sanders stated that the decision was made because Brennan's access to classified information was no longer justified and that his conduct and behavior had exceeded the limits of professional courtesy. Sanders also mentioned that the security clearances of other former officials, including James Clapper, James Comey, Michael Hayden, Sally Yates, Susan Rice, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr, are under review and may be revoked. The President believes that granting access to classified information to former officials who have transitioned into highly partisan positions is inappropriate and that access should be in furtherance of national, not personal, interests.
