Ten Americans who were detained in Venezuela have been released and are returning home, including six who were wrongfully detained. This is a relief for their families who have suffered during their absence. In addition, a fugitive named Leonard Francis, who fled the United States before being sentenced for bribery and corruption, has been arrested in Venezuela and returned to the United States to face justice. The Venezuelan regime has announced an electoral roadmap for competitive presidential elections in 2024, which is seen as a positive step. Twenty political prisoners have also been released, with five previously released. The US government will continue to monitor the situation closely and take appropriate action if necessary. The warning against traveling to Venezuela remains in place for Americans. While celebrating the return of these Americans, the focus is also on securing the release of hostages in Gaza and wrongfully detained Americans in other parts of the world, including Russia, Afghanistan, Syria, and China. The administration is determined to bring them all home.
