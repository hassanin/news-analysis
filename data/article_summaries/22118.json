The United States is working with Vietnam to develop a modern higher education system that produces skilled graduates who can compete in the global market. This collaboration has been growing annually and includes partnerships with higher education institutions and companies. The US has already impacted 30,000 university students in engineering and social work education, and is now expanding support to science, technology, engineering, math, and medical education. The Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV) represents a significant contribution by the US to Vietnam's development and will be the first independent, non-profit university in the country. The US is also involved in initiatives to improve medical education and address emerging health threats, as well as to link STEM education in Vietnamese universities with industry needs. The Fulbright Program has supported both Americans and Vietnamese for study, research, and teaching since 1992. The Fulbright Economics Teaching Program (FETP) has become a Master's degree program and will be incorporated into FUV. The Vietnam Education Foundation (VEF) supports Vietnamese students studying science fields at US institutions. Currently, there are 19,000 Vietnamese students studying in the US, making Vietnam the 9th largest source of foreign students to the US.
