President Donald J. Trump spoke with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France. They all agreed that the Syrian regime, along with its Russian and Iranian supporters, should implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 2401, which calls for an immediate ceasefire in Syria. They called on Russia to stop bombing East Ghouta, compel the Assad regime to halt offensive operations against civilians, and hold Syria accountable for human rights violations. They also expressed concerns about Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent statements on nuclear weapons development, which they believe hinder productive discussions between Russia and the West.
