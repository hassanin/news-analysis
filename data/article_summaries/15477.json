This article is a Presidential Proclamation by Barack Obama, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. The fire occurred on March 25, 1911, and resulted in the deaths of nearly 150 individuals, mostly young immigrant women. The fire was caused by poor working conditions, including overcrowding and locked doors. The tragedy led to significant improvements in workplace safety regulations and the strengthening of organized labor. The proclamation calls for Americans to remember those who lost their lives in unsafe working conditions and to renew efforts to ensure a safe environment for all American workers.
