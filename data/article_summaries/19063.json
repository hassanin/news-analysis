The White House has announced that the United Nations has imposed extensive sanctions on North Korea in response to its weapons of mass destruction proliferation activity and nuclear missile programs. The sanctions include new sectoral sanctions on North Korean mineral exports and financial sanctions targeting North Korean banking activities in support of its weapons of mass destruction programs. The resolution also imposes unprecedented inspection requirements on North Korea cargo and closes loopholes in the implementation of sanctions. The international community, including China and Russia, has sent a strong message to North Korea that there are significant consequences for its actions. The goal of the sanctions is to increase the costs on Pyongyang's leadership as it seeks to advance its prohibited nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The White House believes that these sanctions go further than previous sanctions and will have a direct impact on North Korea's ability to carry out provocative actions. However, it remains to be seen whether these increased pressure and isolation will prompt a change in strategy on the part of North Korea.
