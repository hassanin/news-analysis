In a background press call, a senior administration official provided details on President Biden's executive order to ban the import of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal to the United States. The ban blocks any new purchases of Russian energy and winds down deliveries of existing contracted purchases. It also prohibits new U.S. investment in Russia's energy sector and Americans from participating in foreign investments in the sector. The official emphasized that the U.S. is not a major importer of Russian oil and has a strong domestic energy production and infrastructure. The action was taken to hold Russia accountable for its aggression and to degrade its economy and war machine. The official also mentioned that the U.S. has coordinated with European allies but did not expect them to join the ban due to their different circumstances. The official highlighted the economic costs imposed on Russia through global sanctions and asset freezes, making Russia a global economic and financial pariah. The official did not provide specific estimates on gas prices but acknowledged that there will be costs for standing up to Putin. The official emphasized the need to transition to a clean energy future to reduce dependence on oil and eliminate the ability of producing countries to use it as an economic weapon. The official stated that the U.S. is taking steps to mitigate the pain for American families, such as releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and ensuring stable global energy supplies. The official also mentioned that the U.S. is the leading oil and gas producer in the world and encouraged oil and gas companies to invest in America's energy future. The official reiterated the unity among allies in imposing economic costs on Russia and expressed confidence in finding common ground for future sanctions.
