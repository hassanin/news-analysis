Today, Democrats in Congress united to protect the right to vote and defend democracy by supporting the For the People Act. They opposed voter suppression, which they likened to the Jim Crow era. However, Senate Republicans solidly opposed any discussion or consideration of legislation to protect voting rights. This bill's suppression echoes previous attacks on voting rights. Democrats are committed to continuing the fight to protect democracy, honoring those who sacrificed for this right. The battle is ongoing, and efforts to overcome will be intensified.
