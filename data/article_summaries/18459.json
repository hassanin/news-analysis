President Obama has announced a new effort to crack down on waste and fraud in Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs. This will be done through the expanded use of payment recapture audits, which have been proven to be highly effective in pilot programs. The initiative aims to recoup at least $2 billion in taxpayer money over the next three years. The President has directed all federal departments and agencies to expand and intensify their use of payment recapture audits and supports bipartisan legislation to fund these audits with recaptured payments. The government is also taking other measures to reduce waste and fraud, such as boosting transparency, holding agencies accountable, and creating incentives for compliance. Additionally, efforts are being made to reduce unnecessary costs in healthcare programs, cut broken or duplicative programs, and reduce contracting costs.
