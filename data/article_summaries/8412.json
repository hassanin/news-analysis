This article summarizes an executive order signed by President Joe Biden on August 3, 2022, regarding access to reproductive healthcare services. The order addresses the legal uncertainty and disparate access to reproductive healthcare services caused by restrictive abortion laws in various states. It aims to protect access to reproductive healthcare services and address the crisis facing women's health and public health more broadly. The order defines reproductive healthcare services as medical, surgical, counseling, or referral services related to the human reproductive system, including services related to pregnancy or the termination of a pregnancy. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) is directed to consider actions to advance access to reproductive healthcare services, including through Medicaid for patients traveling across state lines for medical care. The order also promotes compliance with non-discrimination laws in obtaining medical care and directs the Secretary of HHS to evaluate research, data collection, and analysis efforts to measure the effect of access to reproductive healthcare on maternal health outcomes and other health outcomes. The order is to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
