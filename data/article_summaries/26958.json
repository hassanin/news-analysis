First Lady Melania Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos will visit Orchard Lake Middle School in Michigan to kick off the "Week of Inclusion" during National Bullying Prevention Month. Mrs. Trump will spend time in a 6th grade classroom that focuses on social emotional learning, observing and participating in lessons about respecting others, kindness, and inclusion. She will also visit with 7th and 8th grade students in the cafeteria to bring awareness to the "No One Eats Alone" concept, which encourages students to engage in acts of kindness and make sure no one is eating alone. Mrs. Trump expressed her commitment to teaching children empathy, communication, kindness, mindfulness, integrity, and leadership.
