The article is a statement from the President, made on January 21, 2015. The President expresses concern about a Supreme Court ruling from five years ago that allowed big companies, including foreign corporations, to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. The President believes this ruling, known as Citizens United, was wrong and has had a negative impact on democracy. The President argues that this ruling has led to an influx of "dark money" in political ads, which he believes drags politics down. The President calls for a reversal of this trend and suggests that Washington should prioritize the voices of ordinary Americans and protect their democratic right to determine the country's direction.
