President Donald J. Trump has directed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, to accelerate the completion of repairs to Florida's Herbert Hoover Dike. The dike, which surrounds Lake Okeechobee and provides flood protection to South Florida, has been identified as being at high risk of failure and in need of repairs since the early 2000s. The current rehabilitation project began in 2007 but is still more than a decade away from completion. The Trump Administration, in collaboration with Florida Governor Rick Scott, plans to expedite the work and is pleased to see additional state funding allocated to the project. Governor Scott has expressed gratitude to President Trump for prioritizing the repairs and protecting Florida's environment.
