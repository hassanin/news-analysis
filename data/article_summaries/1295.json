The American economy remains strong and is transitioning to steady and stable growth. Real personal disposable income increased and consumer spending continued, although the overall pace of growth moderated. The economy added over 300,000 jobs per month during the quarter, with low unemployment rates and high workforce participation. The Investing in America agenda aims to rebuild the economy by investing in manufacturing, building supply chains, and creating good-paying jobs. These policies have resulted in the creation of 12.5 million jobs over the past two years, including 800,000 manufacturing jobs.
