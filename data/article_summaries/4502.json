The Russian Federation has withdrawn from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), which has led the United States to suspend its obligations under the treaty. The United States made this decision in consultation with its NATO allies, who also support the suspension of CFE Treaty obligations in response to Russia's actions. The suspension will remove restrictions that impact planning, deployments, and exercises, strengthening the Alliance's deterrence and defense capacity. Despite Russia's withdrawal, the United States and its allies remain committed to effective conventional arms control as a critical element of Euro-Atlantic security. They will continue to pursue measures to bolster stability and security in Europe.
