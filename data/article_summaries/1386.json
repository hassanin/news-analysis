President Biden is convening the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF) to address the climate crisis and work towards limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C. The United States is taking new steps to reduce emissions, support developing countries in climate action, and mobilize multilateral development banks to address climate change. The MEF will focus on four key areas: decarbonizing energy, reducing emissions from transportation, ending deforestation, and tackling non-CO2 climate pollutants. The President will announce support for the Green Climate Fund and the Amazon Fund, and encourage other countries to strengthen their climate targets. The U.S. is also taking domestic actions to achieve its climate goals and create clean energy jobs.
