In a meeting with the Senate working group on immigration, President Trump discussed the need for immigration reform that prioritizes the interests of American workers and families. He highlighted the issues of chain migration and the visa lottery, which he believes pose threats to national security and the economy. Trump stressed the importance of building a physical border wall to prevent illegal immigration and the entry of drugs and criminal cartels. He also emphasized the need to provide immigration officers with the necessary resources and authorities to protect American lives. The President expressed his desire to find a solution for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients but insisted that it must be accompanied by border security measures, an end to chain migration, and the elimination of the visa lottery. Trump thanked the senators present for their collaboration, including Democrats, and expressed optimism about the chances of passing immigration reform. The meeting concluded with comments from Vice President Mike Pence and various senators who expressed their support for finding a balanced solution that addresses both border security and the needs of DACA recipients.
