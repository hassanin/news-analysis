This article is a letter from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. The letter discusses the continuation of the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations. The President explains that the activities of these organizations have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous, posing a threat to international political and economic systems. The organizations are also becoming more involved in foreign governments and the international financial system, which weakens democratic institutions, degrades the rule of law, and undermines economic markets. The President states that these organizations facilitate and worsen violent civil conflicts and support other dangerous individuals. Therefore, he determines that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 regarding transnational criminal organizations.
