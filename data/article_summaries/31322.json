President Donald J. Trump is set to visit the Republic of Korea to meet with President Moon Jae-in. The visit will take place in late June, in conjunction with Trump's travel to the region to attend the G20 Summit. The main focus of the meeting will be the ongoing efforts to achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Additionally, the two leaders will discuss ways to strengthen the alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea, as well as enhance the friendship between the two countries.
