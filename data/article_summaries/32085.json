This memorandum, issued by President Donald Trump, addresses the modernization of the monetary reimbursement model for the delivery of goods through the international postal system and the enhancement of the security and safety of international mail. The memorandum defines key terms and outlines the policy of the United States in promoting fair and nondiscriminatory postal rates. It highlights concerns with current international postal practices, including the discrepancy in terminal dues rates and the lack of distinction between documents and goods. The memorandum emphasizes the need for reforms within the Universal Postal Union (UPU) to align with U.S. economic and national security interests. It states that if negotiations at the UPU's September 2018 Extraordinary Congress fail to yield satisfactory reforms, the United States will consider taking appropriate actions to ensure that rates for the delivery of inbound foreign packages meet the outlined criteria. The memorandum assigns responsibilities to the Secretary of State and requires a report on the implementation of the memorandum by November 1, 2018. It concludes with general provisions, stating that it does not impair existing authorities or create enforceable rights or benefits.
