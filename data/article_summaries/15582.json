The President has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism is to continue beyond September 23, 2010. The President believes that the grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism, including the attacks on September 11, 2001, and the continuing threat of further attacks, pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain comprehensive sanctions to respond to this threat.
