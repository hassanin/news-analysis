The President has issued a National Security Memorandum outlining the importance of intelligence collection and analysis for national security. The memorandum establishes the President's Intelligence Priorities (PIP) as the primary mechanism for guiding the Intelligence Community (IC) on the most important intelligence topics. The PIP will inform resource allocations to ensure the collection and analysis of intelligence that provides insights and warning on the identified priorities. The memorandum also establishes a process for updating and executing the PIP, involving the National Security Council (NSC) Deputies Committee and the NSC Principals Committee. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) will manage the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF) process, ensuring representation from the IC and other departments and agencies. The Director of National Intelligence will work with IC department and agency heads to implement the PIP and inform the President of any implementation challenges. The memorandum revokes a previous directive, National Security Presidential Directive/NSPD-26.
