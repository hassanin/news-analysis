No Democrat has yet returned a "blue slip" signaling acceptance of President Trump's federal judicial picks, which is concerning for Republicans who fear it signals an attempt to slow down the administration's plans to reshape the federal judiciary. The Trump administration has been seeking consultation from home-state senators for months but has had difficulty getting responses. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley may alter adherence to the blue slip policy, which gives senators a veto over judges picked from their home states who don't meet with their approval. The first tests of this may come with the nominations of Minnesota Supreme Court Justice David Stras and Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen to the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals. The senators from their home states have not yet returned blue slips for their nominations. The White House claims to have reached out to the senators multiple times.
