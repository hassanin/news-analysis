President Biden, along with Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese, met with business leaders and bipartisan governors to urge Congress to pass competitiveness legislation like the Bipartisan Innovation Act. The bill aims to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing, create more resilient supply chains, invest in basic research, and promote America's innovation agenda while lowering costs for the middle class. The business leaders discussed their plans to reshore manufacturing and increase production in America, citing the need for more resilient supply chains and faster innovation. They also highlighted how domestic production can address rising costs of household goods and protect American consumers from global events that drive up prices. Governors from Indiana and Michigan emphasized the economic importance of passing this legislation for their states.
