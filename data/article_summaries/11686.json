The White House has issued a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Cuba will continue. This emergency was modified in 2016 to reflect the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. The unauthorized entry of any U.S.-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters is seen as detrimental to U.S. foreign policy. Therefore, the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels will continue. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
