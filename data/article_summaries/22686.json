President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama expressed their condolences on the passing of golf legend Charlie Sifford. Sifford was the first African-American to earn a PGA tour card and faced discrimination and injustice during his career. Despite this, he proved his worth by winning twice on tour and paving the way for future generations of athletes. President Obama had the honor of awarding Sifford the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of his impact on the sport and the country. The Obamas' thoughts and prayers are with Sifford's family, friends, and fans.
