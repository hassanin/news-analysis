The Biden Administration disagrees with the court's ruling and plans to appeal it. They believe that the authority to set public health policy should be with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) rather than a single district court. However, while the appeal is ongoing, the administration will still enforce the CDC's 2020 Title 42 public health authority, which means that migrants attempting to enter the United States unlawfully will be expelled under Title 42 and may face immigration consequences such as removal under Title 8. The Department of Homeland Security will continue to plan for the eventual lifting of Title 42 based on the CDC's public health judgment. Once Title 42 is lifted, anyone attempting to enter the country unlawfully will be subject to Title 8 Expedited Removal proceedings unless they have valid grounds to remain in the United States.
