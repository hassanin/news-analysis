This article discusses an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on October 9, 2019, with the aim of ensuring that Americans are subject to only legally binding rules imposed through enacted statutes or regulations. The order emphasizes the importance of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which requires agencies to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking when imposing regulations. The order states that agencies may clarify existing obligations through non-binding guidance documents, but they should not use this authority inappropriately to regulate the public without following proper procedures. The executive branch is directed to treat guidance documents as non-binding, take public input into account, and make them readily available to the public. Legally binding requirements can only be imposed through regulations or adjudications on a case-by-case basis. The order also establishes definitions for key terms and sets requirements for agencies to establish searchable databases for guidance documents and review and rescind outdated ones. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will provide guidance and implement the order. The order clarifies that it does not impair existing authority or functions of executive departments or the OMB Director and that it is subject to applicable law and appropriations. It also specifies exceptions for certain actions related to national security, criminal investigations, agency employee misconduct, Freedom of Information Act exemptions, and circumstances where the order may undermine national security.
