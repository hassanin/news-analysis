A new report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) highlights the effectiveness of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as Food Stamps, in reducing food insecurity. The report states that children who receive food assistance experience improvements in health and academic performance, and these benefits extend into adulthood. Additionally, the report reveals that benefit levels are often inadequate to sustain families through the end of the month, resulting in negative consequences such as increased hospital admissions and diminished performance on standardized tests. SNAP helps approximately 46 million low-income Americans each month, with the majority of recipients being children, senior citizens, individuals with disabilities, and working adults. The report also emphasizes the long-term benefits of SNAP, including reductions in obesity rates, increased high school completion rates, and improved economic self-sufficiency for disadvantaged individuals. Despite the positive impact of SNAP, nearly one in seven American households experienced food insecurity in 2014. The report calls for continued efforts to improve access to nutrition for vulnerable populations, such as expanding the Community Eligibility Provision in schools and providing cash benefits for the purchase of fruits and vegetables through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The report also highlights the need to address the insufficient benefit levels that leave families struggling to afford food at the end of the month.
