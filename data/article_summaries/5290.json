The White House Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, provided key points on President Biden's engagement in a recent operation against ISIS during a briefing on Air Force One. The operation had been months in planning, and the President was regularly updated on the details. He monitored key aspects of the operation in real time in the White House Situation Room. The President directed the Department of Defense to minimize noncombatant casualties, but unfortunately, ISIS demonstrated its disregard for innocent lives by detonating an explosive device, killing the terrorist leader, a woman, and three children. The President's engagement in this operation shows that the U.S. will take out terrorist threats wherever they hide and hold them accountable. Psaki also addressed questions about the President's stance on crime, support for law enforcement, police reform, and ongoing discussions in Congress. She mentioned that the President's strong support for police is not in conflict with advocating for police reform. Psaki also provided updates on international coordination, the Supreme Court nomination process, ongoing talks with Russia and Belarus, and the assessment of civilian casualties in the operation against ISIS.
