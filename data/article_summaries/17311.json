A new report by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) calls for a boost in American agricultural science through increased public investments and the creation of a network of public-private agricultural "innovation institutes." The report identifies the top seven challenges facing agriculture, including managing pests and pathogens, increasing water efficiency, reducing the environmental footprint, adapting to climate change, and meeting demands for bioenergy while ensuring food security and nutrition. The report highlights the need for a renewed commitment to research, innovation, and technology development in agriculture to address these challenges. It also emphasizes the importance of competitive research grants and a rebalancing of the research portfolio to prioritize basic, non-commercial research and workforce development. The report recommends an increase in funding for agricultural research and the creation of six large, multidisciplinary innovation institutes supported by public-private partnerships. The full report can be viewed on the White House website.
