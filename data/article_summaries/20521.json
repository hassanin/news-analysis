This article is a notice from the President of the United States, Barack Obama, regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor. The President declares that on July 22, 2004, he declared a national emergency and ordered measures, including the blocking of property, related to the former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor. This was done to address the threat to the foreign policy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others, including the unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and removal of funds and property from Liberia. These actions have undermined Liberia's transition to democracy and its development. The President states that the actions and policies of these individuals continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States, therefore, the national emergency and the measures adopted to deal with it must continue beyond July 22, 2010. The President is continuing the national emergency for one year in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
