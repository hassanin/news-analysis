Twenty years after the tragic terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. This day serves as a time to remember the lives lost and honor the bravery of first responders, emergency workers, and civilians who risked their lives to save others. It also recognizes the patriotism and valor of the service members who pursued the attackers and brought justice to Osama bin Laden. The American people have shown resilience and unity in the face of adversity, and this day serves as a reminder of the shared values that bind the nation together. President Biden calls upon all Americans to participate in community service and observe a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor the victims of the attacks. The flag of the United States is to be displayed at half-staff, and appropriate ceremonies and activities are encouraged to commemorate this day.
