Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed a group of leaders to the Vice President's Ceremonial Office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The discussion focused on addressing the needs of women in America following the recent Dobbs decision by the Supreme Court. Harris expressed concern about extremist leaders passing laws that criminalize health providers and punish women, even in cases of rape or incest. As a former prosecutor specializing in child sexual assault cases, Harris emphasized the importance of women's right to make decisions about their own bodies. She praised Latina leaders for their work on this issue and stressed the need to ensure that no woman feels alone or unheard. Harris also highlighted the principle that the government should not be making decisions for women, while respecting individual beliefs and faith. She acknowledged specific challenges faced by Latinas, such as language barriers and lack of access to healthcare. The administration is taking a whole-of-government approach to address these issues, collaborating with leaders on the ground and across various agencies.
