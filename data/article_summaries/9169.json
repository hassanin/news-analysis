The Supreme Court's recent decision in Texas threatens the legal precedent set by Roe v. Wade and women's right to make decisions about their own bodies. The majority of justices allowed a bounty law to go into effect, which bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, even in cases of rape or incest. This decision is not the final ruling on Roe v. Wade, and efforts will be made to prevent a return to unsafe back-alley abortions. The Administration will use all available means to defend and strengthen the right to safe and legal abortion.
