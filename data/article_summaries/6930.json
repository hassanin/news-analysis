In this article, it is stated that 16 more people, including Liat Beinin, have been returned to their families after being held hostage by Hamas for over 50 days. Liat Beinin is a high school teacher, a guide at Israel's Holocaust Museum Yad Vashem, and an American. The author expresses gratitude and relief that Liat will soon be reunited with her three children and father. The United States has been working intensively to secure a deal to pause the fighting in Gaza and facilitate the release of hostages, which is now in its sixth day. This deal has resulted in the return of nearly 100 hostages. The United States has also led efforts to accelerate the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, with over 200 trucks loaded with aid entering each day. Aid has reached northern Gaza for the first time, and the United States has airlifted medical equipment and food aid to a humanitarian distribution center in Egypt. The author thanks Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar, and President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi of Egypt for their partnership and commitment to bringing every hostage home and providing aid to the people of Gaza.
