The Biden Administration has announced that COVIDTests.gov is now open for a third round of ordering. U.S. households can now order an additional eight free at-home tests, bringing the total number of free tests available to each household to 16. This is in response to the rise in COVID-19 cases driven by the highly transmissible subvariants of Omicron. In January 2022, President Biden committed to making one billion at-home tests available for free, with half-a-billion available for ordering at COVIDTests.gov. Over 70 million households have visited the website to order tests, and the Administration has delivered approximately 350 million free tests to mailboxes and doorsteps across the country. The third round of tests was purchased earlier this year with funding from the American Rescue Plan. People who have difficulty accessing the internet or need assistance can call a helpline for support. However, the Administration's ability to provide free tests in the future may be jeopardized due to Congress's failure to provide additional funding for the nation's COVID-19 response. The announcement emphasizes the Administration's commitment to ensuring the availability of lifesaving tools for the American people.
