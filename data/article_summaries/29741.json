On August 6, 2020, President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order to address the national emergency concerning the information and communications technology and services supply chain. The order specifically focuses on the threat posed by the mobile application TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance Ltd. TikTok has been downloaded over 175 million times in the United States and over one billion times globally. The concern is that TikTok collects vast amounts of user information, including location data and browsing history, which could potentially be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. In addition, TikTok reportedly censors politically sensitive content and may be used for disinformation campaigns. The Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration, and the United States Armed Forces have already banned the use of TikTok on government phones. The government of India has also banned TikTok and other Chinese mobile applications due to concerns about unauthorized data transmission. This executive order prohibits certain transactions with ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries, beginning 45 days after the date of the order. The Secretary of Commerce will identify the specific transactions subject to this prohibition. The order also prohibits any transactions that evade or avoid the prohibition, as well as any conspiracies formed to violate it. The Secretary is authorized to take necessary actions to implement this order, and all departments and agencies of the United States are required to comply. The order does not affect existing authorities granted by law or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is intended to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
