The White House released a fact sheet on March 10, 2009, outlining President Barack Obama's plans to expand education in America. The article highlights the importance of education in a global economy and the need to provide every child with a complete and competitive education. The goals include improving early education, fostering a race to the top in K-12 education, investing in teachers, driving innovation, addressing the needs of low-performing schools, and restoring America's leadership in higher education. The fact sheet also mentions specific initiatives and strategies that will be implemented to achieve these goals, such as early learning challenge grants, improving teacher quality, supporting charter schools, addressing the dropout crisis, and increasing college access and success.
