President Trump has designated Richard Grenell, the United States Ambassador to Germany, as the Acting Director of National Intelligence. Grenell, who was confirmed as Ambassador in April 2018, has experience working with the Intelligence Community in various positions. This includes serving as the Special Envoy for Serbia-Kosovo Negotiations and as the United States spokesman to the United Nations. The President believes that Grenell will approach his new role in a non-political and non-partisan manner, recognizing the importance of the Intelligence Community in ensuring safety and security.
