President Biden held a signing ceremony in the State Dining Room to sign three bills into law that extend critical support to law enforcement, first responders, and the communities they serve. The first bill is the COPS Counseling Act, which aims to help law enforcement officers recover from the invisible wounds that their work can inflict by providing access to peer counseling programs and mental health resources. The second bill is the Protect America's First Responders Act, which improves the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program to provide disability and education benefits to first responders who are disabled or killed in the line of duty. The third bill is named after Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who were ambushed by a drug cartel hitman in Mexico in 2011. This bill clarifies that the Department of Justice can prosecute anyone who kills or attempts to kill a federal law enforcement officer outside of the United States. President Biden emphasized the importance of supporting law enforcement officers and first responders and thanked the bipartisan leaders and law enforcement organizations for their efforts. He also called on the bipartisan leaders to come together to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
