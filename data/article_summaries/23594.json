The Affordable Care Act (ACA) raises the age at which children can be covered on their parents' health insurance policy and provides incentives for employers to extend coverage to children up to age 27. The IRS has released new guidance on this provision, allowing workplace and retiree health insurance plans to add children under age 27 on a tax-free basis. Employers can permit employees to make pre-tax contributions to cover these children, and the expanded tax benefit applies to various health plans, including those for self-employed individuals. Employers have until the end of 2010 to amend their cafeteria plan language to reflect this change. The IRS has issued guidance and press releases to inform employers, employees, health insurers, and taxpayers about these changes. The article also mentions that the Health and Human Services Secretary has called on insurance companies to voluntarily cover young adults before the required implementation date of September 23, 2010, to avoid coverage gaps and administrative costs. Several insurance companies have agreed to maintain coverage for young adults enrolled on their parents' plans.
