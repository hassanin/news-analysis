The article discusses the Small Business Jobs Act signed by President Obama in 2010. The law provides immediate support and incentives for small businesses in the country to grow and hire more employees. It includes various proposals presented by the President and offers several tax cuts for small businesses. These tax cuts include the immediate deduction of up to $500,000 for new equipment purchases, exemption from capital gains taxes for certain long-term investments, deduction of the first $10,000 in start-up expenses, and the ability to deduct 100% of the cost of self-employed health insurance. The law also extends successful clauses from the Recovery Act, allowing the Small Business Administration (SBA) to resume loans for over 1,300 small businesses and provides $14 billion in loans to small businesses. Additionally, the Department of Treasury is working on implementing the Small Business Lending Fund and the State Small Business Credit Initiative to support private sector loans to creditworthy small businesses.
