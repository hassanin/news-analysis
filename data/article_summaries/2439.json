President Biden is heading to Boston for two events. First, he will visit Boston Logan International Airport, which is undergoing modernization thanks to a $50 million investment from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This funding will expand terminal capacity, improve customer services, and create around 5,900 jobs. Second, he will head to the John F. Kennedy Library on the 60th anniversary of President Kennedy's Moonshot speech to lay out his vision for another American moonshot - ending cancer. The President announced new actions to accelerate the Cancer Moonshot efforts, including appointing Dr. Renee Wegrzyn as the inaugural director of ARPA-H, a new agency focused on delivering innovations to improve Americans' health. The President also signed an executive order establishing a new biotech and manufacturing initiative to ensure cutting-edge biotechnologies are developed and manufactured in America. The article also mentions President Biden's commitment to reducing prescription drug costs, supporting African Union talks in Ethiopia, and attending the Queen's funeral in the UK. The White House did not comment on Ukraine's counteroffensive, China's visit to Russia, or former Presidents invoking executive privilege.
