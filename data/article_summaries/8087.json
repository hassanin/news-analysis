The United States will never recognize Ukrainian territory as anything other than part of Ukraine. They consider Russia's referenda to be a sham and a false pretext to annex parts of Ukraine by force, which violates international law, including the United Nations Charter. The US plans to work with allies and partners to impose additional economic costs on Russia. They stand with their partners worldwide and reject any fabricated outcomes that Russia may announce. The US will continue to support Ukraine and provide security assistance to help them defend themselves against Russia's invasion.
