The White House is pleased with the Senate's decision to support the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) authority to protect public health through the Clean Air Act. The Senate rejected attempts to roll back the EPA's efforts to safeguard Americans from harmful pollution. This decision also rejected an approach that would have increased the nation's reliance on oil, gone against the scientific consensus on global warming, and undermined America's leadership in the clean energy economy. The Clean Air Act is seen as a crucial tool in protecting families, especially children, from various pollutants that cause asthma and lung disease. The administration remains committed to preserving this important law.
