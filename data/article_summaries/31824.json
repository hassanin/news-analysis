President Trump recently reached a trade agreement with the European Union (EU) that aims to lower tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU has pledged to lower tariffs on American soybeans, oil, gas, pharmaceutical products, and certain manufactured goods, while Trump promised to suspend some auto and aluminum and steel tariffs. Additionally, both parties agreed to combat unfair trading practices such as intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, industrial subsidies, and distortions created by state-owned enterprises. This agreement is seen as a victory for the American economy and could potentially help isolate China as a bad actor in global trade.
