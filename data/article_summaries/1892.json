The President has appointed a senior team to negotiate with the Speaker's team on a budget agreement. Both the President and the Speaker have agreed that any agreement should be bipartisan. However, the Speaker's team recently presented an offer that was seen as a significant step back and included extreme partisan demands that would never pass both Houses of Congress. The President has consistently proposed deficit reduction measures such as spending limits, cuts to Big Pharma profits, and closing tax loopholes for oil and gas. The President's team is ready to meet at any time, and it is important to focus on what can pass in a bipartisan manner, reach the President's desk, and reduce the deficit. The threat of defaulting on the nation's debt for the first time in history is coming from the Republican leadership, specifically those aligned with the MAGA wing, rather than the President or Democratic leadership, who are not willing to meet extreme partisan demands.
