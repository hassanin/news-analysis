Vice President Kamala Harris is embarking on a month-long college tour across America to mobilize young people in the fight for fundamental freedoms and rights. She will visit around a dozen campuses in at least seven states and bring together thousands of students for large-scale events. The tour, called "Fight for Our Freedoms College Tour," will focus on key issues that disproportionately impact young people, such as reproductive freedom, gun safety, climate action, voting rights, LGBTQ+ equality, and book bans. Harris will visit historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, community colleges, apprenticeship programs, and state schools. She will highlight the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts for young people, discuss the work ahead to protect fundamental freedoms, and listen to students organizing on the frontlines of these fights. Harris will also encourage attendees to register to vote, use their voice, and stay engaged. This college tour is a continuation of her recent travel and follows her Summer of Action, which included visits to 17 states.
