The press briefing by Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag discusses the House and Senate budget plans that align with President Obama's key priorities. These priorities include investments in healthcare, energy, and education, as well as cutting the deficit in half. The budget resolutions from both the House and Senate meet these criteria. The briefing also mentions the deficit-neutral reserve funds for healthcare and clean energy, as well as proposed increases in Pell Grants. Orszag addresses criticisms of the budget and emphasizes the importance of investing in healthcare, energy, and education for long-term prosperity. The briefing concludes with discussions on the tax gap, farm subsidies, and the Volcker board's role in tax reform.
