President Obama has directed a comprehensive review to strengthen the United States' ability to prevent mass atrocities and serious human rights violations. This includes creating a standing interagency Atrocities Prevention Board to develop prevention strategies and ensure concerns are elevated for senior decision-making. The President has also issued a proclamation that explicitly bars entry into the United States for individuals involved in war crimes, crimes against humanity, and serious human rights violations. The directive emphasizes that preventing mass atrocities is a core national security interest and moral responsibility for the United States. It also calls for a whole-of-government approach, utilizing a range of economic, diplomatic, and other tools to prevent and respond to mass atrocities. The directive recognizes the shared responsibility of all nations in preventing mass atrocities and calls for a strategy to engage regional allies and partners. The proclamation closes gaps in existing U.S. law to deny admission to the United States for individuals involved in a broader array of recognized violations of international humanitarian law and international criminal law. This serves as a deterrent and allows the United States to more effectively shame and act against those involved in planning or carrying out serious human rights violations and atrocities.
