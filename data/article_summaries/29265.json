The U.S. Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, wrote an op-ed discussing the importance of American ingenuity and innovation in the energy sector. He highlights the significant progress the United States has made in producing abundant, affordable, and clean energy from a wide range of sources. Perry emphasizes the role of natural gas in the country's energy portfolio, stating that it is the single largest source of electricity generation, accounting for 32% of all U.S. production. He also mentions that the United States is now producing enough natural gas to be on the verge of energy independence and has become a net natural gas exporter. Perry notes that the country is sharing its energy bounty with other nations, empowering them economically and energy-wise. He concludes by stating that by providing other nations with the tools to develop their own energy resources responsibly, the United States can contribute to global economic growth and energy security.
