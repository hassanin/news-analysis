The United States has been accepted as a candidate country for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), an international standard that promotes transparency and accountability in the natural resource sector. The U.S. is the first G-8 country to achieve this status and joins a group of 41 countries working to improve the management of their oil, gas, and mining sectors. Through the Department of the Interior, the U.S. will continue its efforts to increase revenue transparency and accountability in relevant industries, ensuring that taxpayers receive the full benefits of natural resource extraction. This move aims to make the U.S. government more open and accountable to its citizens.
