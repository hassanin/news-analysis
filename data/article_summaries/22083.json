Vice President Biden spoke with Egyptian Vice President Omar Soliman to express the United States' support for a peaceful and legitimate transition in Egypt. Biden urged the Egyptian government to take immediate action to address the demands of the Egyptian people, including ending the arrests and harassment of journalists and activists, rescinding the emergency law, broadening participation in the national dialogue, and involving the opposition in developing a roadmap for transition. Biden believes that these demands can be met through meaningful negotiations with the government.
