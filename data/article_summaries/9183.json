The article is a speech delivered by Vice President Kamala Harris at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. She acknowledges the importance of organizations like EMILY's List in protecting women's rights, particularly in the face of potential threats to Roe v. Wade. Harris emphasizes that a world without Roe v. Wade would severely limit women's access to abortion in almost half the country. She criticizes Republican leaders for attempting to control women's bodies and denies them the right to determine their own futures. Harris argues that the attack on Roe v. Wade is an attack on the fundamental right to privacy for all Americans, not just women. She urges people to stand together in defense of freedom, self-determination, and privacy, stating that women's issues are America's issues and that democracies cannot be strong if women's rights are under attack. Harris concludes by calling on everyone to fight for the principles upon which the country was founded.
