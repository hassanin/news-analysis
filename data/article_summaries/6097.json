The United States Senate recently had a chance to support the right to vote, but Senate Democrats were the only ones who voted in favor of it, while Republicans failed to do so. The President and the speaker of the House are determined to keep fighting for this right. There is still much work to be done to ensure every American can exercise their right to vote, and those who have been advocating for this cause will not give up.
