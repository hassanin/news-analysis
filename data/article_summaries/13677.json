Japan and the United States have announced a pledge to remove highly-enriched uranium (HEU) and separated plutonium from Japan's Fast Critical Assembly (FCA) research facility. This partnership aims to eliminate hundreds of kilograms of sensitive nuclear material and prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. The FCA, which was established in 1967, will now be able to continue its mission without the need for HEU or plutonium fuels, thanks to advancements in technology. This conversion of the FCA will make it the world's first major fast critical facility to operate without HEU and plutonium fuels, a significant milestone for global nuclear security. The United States and Japan have previously successfully converted other research reactors from HEU to low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel, which cannot be used to produce a nuclear weapon. JAEA has also been actively involved in promoting the conversion of its research reactors to eliminate HEU from civilian commerce.
