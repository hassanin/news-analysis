The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a conference call to discuss the First Lady’s upcoming trip to China. The purpose of the trip is to focus on people-to-people exchange, cultural exchanges, and the importance of education for young people in both China and the United States. The First Lady will visit three cities in China: Beijing, Xi’an, and Chengdu. In Beijing, she will meet with Madame Peng, the First Lady of China, visit a school, and have a private dinner and performance with Madame Peng. In Xi’an, she will visit the Terra Cotta Warriors and the Walled City. In Chengdu, she will give a speech at a high school and meet with young people. The trip is seen as an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between the United States and China and improve the U.S. image in China. The First Lady’s trip is not focused on political issues, but rather on building connections with the Chinese people. The cost of the trip and the details of who is traveling with the First Lady are not disclosed. There is no expectation of protests during the trip. The First Lady’s visit to China was planned before the Dalai Lama’s visit to the White House, so it is not related to that event. The trip is seen as a way to improve the U.S.-China relationship and relieve tensions. Sasha Obama had previously taken Mandarin lessons but is not currently studying the language.
