German-American Day is a celebration of the contributions made by German-Americans to the United States. The proclamation acknowledges the important role that German immigrants played in shaping American history, from the early days of the Continental Congress to the establishment of universal public education. It also highlights the influence of German customs on American culture, particularly during Christmas and Easter. The proclamation also recognizes the 30th anniversary of German reunification and emphasizes the strong transatlantic ties between the United States and Germany. President Donald Trump calls upon all Americans to celebrate German-American achievements and contributions through appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
