President Trump held a meeting with governors, mayors, and other officials to discuss the need for infrastructure investment in the United States. During the meeting, Trump emphasized the importance of rebuilding America's crumbling infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and ports. He expressed frustration with the amount of money spent in the Middle East and called for a shift in focus towards domestic infrastructure. Trump also highlighted the need to streamline the permitting process and reduce the time it takes to approve infrastructure projects. He unveiled his legislative principles for a $1.5- to $1.7-trillion infrastructure investment plan that would leverage public-private partnerships and speed up the permit approval process. The plan would also allocate $50 billion for rural infrastructure and prioritize safety and security. Trump urged the governors and mayors to work with their representatives in Congress to support the plan and push for its passage.
