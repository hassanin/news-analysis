President Trump will be visiting Cleveland, Ohio to discuss the impact of his tax cuts legislation on jobs and wages. Cleveland has gained 3,300 new manufacturing jobs since Trump took office. The President has heard from Ohioans about tax cuts in the past, with one resident stating that they now have more money in the bank due to the cuts. Mrs. Sharlene Thornton, who lost her husband's job at a steel mill to Chinese steel, wrote a letter thanking President Trump for the tax cuts, stating that they have made a significant difference in their biweekly paycheck. She mentions that they almost lost their home during the time her husband was unemployed, but now they are grateful for the extra money they receive monthly.
