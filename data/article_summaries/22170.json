First Lady Michelle Obama has announced that the American Logistics Association (ALA) and its 270 affiliate companies have committed to hiring 25,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2013. This commitment is part of the Joining Forces initiative, which aims to support veterans and military families. The ALA's commitment fulfills a quarter of the President's challenge to the private sector to hire or train 100,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2013. The ALA, led by major consumer packaged goods companies, will be teaming up with employment programs such as the Military Spouse Employment Partnership and the Chamber of Commerce's Hiring Our Heroes program to achieve its goal. The Joining Forces initiative, created by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden, focuses on employment, education, and wellness for veterans and military families. The ALA's commitment further promotes the goal of creating greater connections between the American public and those who have served and sacrificed for the country.
