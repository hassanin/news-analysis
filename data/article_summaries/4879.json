Pfizer has released promising data on its antiviral pill, showing its effectiveness in reducing the risk of severe illness in COVID-19 patients. This provides another tool in the fight against the virus, including the Omicron variant. The pill still needs authorization from the FDA before it can be made available. The US government has already ordered enough pills to treat 10 million Americans. While vaccination and booster shots remain crucial, this treatment could be a significant step forward in overcoming the pandemic, along with widespread testing and effective pills for those who become sick.
