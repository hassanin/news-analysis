President Joe Biden has announced his intent to nominate two individuals, Daniel Tangherlini and Derek Kan, to the bipartisan United States Postal Service (USPS) Board of Governors. These nominations come as replacements for outgoing Governors Ron Bloom and John Barger. President Biden is committed to supporting USPS workers in their efforts to provide essential services to millions of Americans, particularly those in rural communities, veterans, and older Americans who heavily rely on the Postal Service. The President also aims to strengthen and modernize the USPS to ensure its continued service for years to come. The USPS Board of Governors consists of up to nine governors, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, with no more than five governors from the same party. Daniel Tangherlini has experience in leadership roles in the public, non-profit, and private sectors, focusing on equity and efficiency through technology and process reform. Derek Kan is currently an executive at an ecommerce fulfillment startup and has previously served in various government and private sector roles, including Lyft and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Both nominees have extensive backgrounds and qualifications in their respective fields.
