President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Louisiana due to severe storms and flooding. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to affected individuals and local governments in certain parishes. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will be coordinating federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are still ongoing, and more areas and forms of assistance may be designated in the future. Residents and business owners in the designated parishes can begin applying for assistance online or by phone.
