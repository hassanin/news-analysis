President Obama has proposed new funding to build resilience in Alaska's communities and combat climate change. Alaska is experiencing the consequences of climate change at an accelerated rate, with higher average temperatures causing the diminishing range of winter sea ice and storm surges affecting the coastline. The President's 2017 Budget includes proposals such as accelerating the construction of a new icebreaker, establishing a Coastal Climate Resilience Fund, supporting the Denali Commission, building capacity and critical infrastructure in Alaska Native Villages, providing full funding for Land and Water Conservation Fund programs, and funding the National Park Centennial Initiative. The Administration has also announced an allocation of $8.3 million for improvements in the harbor of Port Lions, Alaska.
