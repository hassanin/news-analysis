Today marks the 31st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a landmark civil rights law that promotes inclusion and access for disabled Americans. The ADA prohibits discrimination based on disability in various contexts such as public accommodation, employment, transportation, and community living, and provides recourse for those who face discrimination. President Biden will sign a proclamation to commemorate this day. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken significant steps to create a more inclusive and equitable country for people with disabilities, including those who face multiple forms of discrimination. They have ensured that disabled Americans receive resources and are included in key administrative proposals. The Build Back Better agenda aims to provide investments for children and adults with disabilities to achieve independent living, economic self-sufficiency, equitable educational opportunities, and full participation in the workforce and communities. Additionally, the Administration is releasing guidance and resources to support individuals experiencing long-term COVID-19 symptoms, commonly known as "long COVID," clarifying their rights for health and educational services and supports.
