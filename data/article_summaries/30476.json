On the 29th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation celebrating the historic legislation and renewing the commitment to empowering Americans with disabilities. The ADA has transformed the lives of millions of Americans by promoting equal access to employment, government services, public accommodations, commercial facilities, and public transportation. The proclamation highlights the growth of employment opportunities for Americans with disabilities and the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded during President Trump's administration. The administration is also taking steps to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans, including those with disabilities, through initiatives such as the Multi-Agency Task Force on Improving Employment for People with Disabilities. Furthermore, the proclamation mentions the signing of an Executive Order to increase apprenticeship opportunities for all Americans, including those with disabilities, as well as the support for research and development of new technologies to enhance access and quality of life for Americans with disabilities. The proclamation concludes by calling upon all Americans to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that celebrate the contributions of Americans with disabilities and renew the commitment to achieving freedom for all Americans.
