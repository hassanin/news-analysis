The White House is taking action to discourage companies from using a tax loophole called corporate inversion, which allows them to move their tax residence overseas to avoid paying taxes in the United States. This practice erodes the American tax base and puts a burden on the middle class and small businesses. The Department of Treasury has already taken steps to reduce the tax benefits of corporate inversions, but only Congress can stop them entirely. The President has proposed closing the corporate inversion loophole in his last three budgets and calls on Congress to support workers and businesses that play by the rules.
