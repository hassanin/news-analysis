First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden addressed the National Governors Association, urging governors to help put America's heroes back to work. They called for all 50 states to take action by the end of 2015 to help military veterans obtain the credentials they need to transition to civilian jobs. The Executive Office of the President released a report detailing the barriers veterans and their families face in finding employment and the progress that has been made. The United States has the most highly trained military in the world, but many veterans face obstacles in finding jobs that utilize their skills. The Fast Track to Civilian Employment initiative aims to help veterans gain industry-recognized licenses and credentials. The Defense Department Military Credentialing and Licensing Task Force was created to assist service members in transferring their education and training to civilian jobs. Partnerships with manufacturing credentialing bodies have been established to provide opportunities for service members to gain certifications for high-demand manufacturing jobs. The initiative is also expanding efforts to assist states in translating military training and experience into credit towards professional licensure. The initiative also addresses the challenges faced by military spouses in obtaining occupational licenses due to frequent moves. The Department of Defense has worked with state legislators and regulators to develop best practices for military spouse licensure, including licensure through endorsement, temporary licensure, and expedited processes for issuing licenses.
