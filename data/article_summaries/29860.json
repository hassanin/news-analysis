The United States congratulates Libya for destroying its Qadhafi-era chemical weapons stockpile and meeting its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Several countries and organizations, including Denmark, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, Finland, Italy, Malta, France, Spain, and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, played crucial roles in the proper destruction of these dangerous chemicals. This achievement highlights the progress that can be made when nations cooperate. However, the United States calls on Syria to eliminate all chemical weapons, dismantle its chemical weapons program, and prevent further use of these weapons against its people.
