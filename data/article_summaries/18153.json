In June 2009, President Barack Obama proclaimed June as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Pride Month. The proclamation recognized the historic resistance against police harassment at the Stonewall Inn in New York City in June 1969, which led to the birth of the LGBT rights movement in America. The proclamation acknowledged the contributions of LGBT Americans to society, including their leadership in various professional fields and their role in responding to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. President Obama expressed pride in appointing openly LGBT individuals to Senate-confirmed positions and highlighted the progress made in advancing equal rights for the LGBT community. However, he emphasized that more work needed to be done, such as ensuring the safety of LGBT youth and the rights of LGBT families and seniors. The President pledged his support for initiatives to enhance hate crimes laws, support civil unions and federal rights for LGBT couples, outlaw workplace discrimination, ensure adoption rights, and repeal the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy in a way that strengthens national security. President Obama also called for efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. He urged the LGBT community, Congress, and the American people to work together to promote equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.
