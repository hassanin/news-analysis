The United States has declassified and released data on its highly enriched uranium (HEU) inventory for the first time in fifteen years. The data shows that from 1996 to 2013, U.S. HEU inventories decreased by over 20 percent, from 740.7 metric tons to 585.6 metric tons. The U.S. Department of Energy's material disposition program has also down-blended 7.1 metric tons of HEU since September 30, 2013. This transparency in sharing information on nuclear security is an important part of global efforts to strengthen nuclear security. The declassified data includes the total U.S. HEU inventory, the amount allocated for national security or non-national security programs, the amount available for down-blending or disposal, and the amount in spent reactor fuel. The United States believes that improving its own nuclear security and transparency encourages other countries to do the same. The U.S. has also demonstrated its commitment to sharing appropriate nuclear security-related information through actions such as declassifying information on its nuclear weapons stockpile and allowing transparency visits by officials from non-nuclear weapons states to its national laboratories.
