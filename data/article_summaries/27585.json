The article is a statement issued by the President of the United States on September 5, 2017 regarding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The President emphasizes his duty to defend the American people and the Constitution, while expressing sympathy for the children of illegal immigrants. However, he argues that DACA was implemented unilaterally by the previous administration, bypassing Congress, and is therefore unlawful and unconstitutional. The President announces the Department of Homeland Security will begin an orderly wind-down of DACA, with existing work permits honored until expiration. He urges Congress to take action on responsible immigration reform that prioritizes American jobs and security. The President also emphasizes the need to reform the green card system and establish a merit-based immigration system. He concludes by calling on Congress to address these issues and to prioritize the needs of American citizens.
