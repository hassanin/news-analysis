The leaders of the G7 and guest countries, including President Biden, have committed to providing over 1 billion additional COVID-19 vaccines for the world. The United States will contribute half a billion doses. This commitment forms the basis of a comprehensive set of actions to end the global pandemic in 2022. The G7+ action plan includes vaccinating the most vulnerable, providing emergency supplies, supporting economic recovery, and preparing for future biological catastrophes. The United States will lead a global vaccination campaign, providing 500 million vaccines through COVAX starting in August 2021. This donation is the largest single donation of vaccines in history. The G7+ commitment aims to provide an additional 1 billion vaccine doses over the next year, especially to the most vulnerable. The United States and the G7+ will also take steps to prevent future pandemics and build back better. The adoption of the G7+ action plan is expected this weekend, and other countries and private sector partners are encouraged to support the ambition.
