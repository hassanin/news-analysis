President Donald Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum expanding access to high-quality Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) and Computer Science education for K-12 students. The goal is to provide Americans, especially young Americans, the skills they need to be competitive in the job market. Currently, many schools in America do not offer computer programming or physics, and STEM and Computer Science education among women, minorities, and students in rural communities is limited. The Presidential Memorandum directs Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to prioritize STEM education and allocate at least $200 million per year in grant funds towards this priority. The signing of this memorandum follows the President's Executive Order on Expanding Apprenticeships in America in June and is part of a series of events led by Ivanka Trump on the importance of computer science education.
