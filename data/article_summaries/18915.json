Senator Robert Menendez expressed his support for President Obama's American Jobs Act, which aims to create jobs, boost the economy, and provide tax relief for middle-class Americans. He emphasized the importance of getting people back to work, especially teachers, first responders, and construction workers. Menendez also highlighted that the proposal will not add to the deficit and includes some Republican ideas. He urged both parties to support the plan and emphasized that the focus should be on helping people and their families, rather than political games.
