President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed November 2019 as National Entrepreneurship Month in the United States. In his proclamation, he recognizes the men and women who have turned their passion into innovation and pledges to continue fostering economic freedom for the next generation of entrepreneurs. The proclamation highlights the factors that make the United States a conducive environment for entrepreneurs, such as access to research and development infrastructure, private capital markets, and a strong intellectual property rights system. The Trump Administration has also been reducing unnecessary regulations to support small business owners. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law by President Trump, has provided tax relief for small businesses and created Opportunity Zones to stimulate entrepreneurship in economically depressed communities. The results of the Administration's tax reform and deregulation efforts have led to the addition of over 6.4 million jobs and a decrease in the unemployment rate. President Trump calls upon all Americans to commemorate National Entrepreneurship Month with appropriate programs and activities, and to celebrate November 19, 2019, as National Entrepreneurs' Day.
