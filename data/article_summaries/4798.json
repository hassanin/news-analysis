During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan discussed President Biden's visit to the State Department and his focus on diplomacy. Sullivan outlined five major lines of effort in the administration's foreign policy approach: investments at home, revitalizing alliances, reengaging with international institutions, reasserting American values, and getting global force posture right. Psaki also addressed questions about student loan debt forgiveness, the COVID-19 relief package, reopening schools, and other policy issues. Psaki mentioned that the President supports canceling $10,000 of federal student loan debt per person, but any changes would need to come through Congress. She also stated that the President wants schools to open and stay open but is waiting for final guidance from the CDC on reopening safely. Psaki mentioned that the President is committed to taking action on gun safety and supports efforts to provide additional funding for the Child Tax Credit. Regarding international issues, Psaki confirmed that the President will sign a presidential memorandum on protecting the rights of LGBTQ individuals worldwide and expressed support for COVAX, the global vaccine distribution initiative.
