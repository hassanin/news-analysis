President Joe Biden announced from the Treaty Room in the White House that the United States will begin its final withdrawal from Afghanistan on May 1, 2021. He explained that while the original agreement to withdraw by this date was not one he personally negotiated, it was a commitment made by the United States government that he intends to uphold. Biden emphasized that the primary objective of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan was to prevent future terrorist attacks on American soil, and that this objective has been achieved. He highlighted the killing of Osama bin Laden as a significant milestone in the fight against terrorism. Biden acknowledged that the terrorist threat has evolved and become more dispersed over the past 20 years, with various groups operating in different countries. He argued that it no longer makes sense to keep thousands of troops concentrated in Afghanistan when the threat is spread globally. Biden stated that the United States will reorganize its counterterrorism capabilities to prevent the reemergence of terrorist threats from over the horizon. He emphasized that the United States will continue to support Afghanistan diplomatically and in terms of humanitarian aid, while also urging other countries in the region to do the same. Biden addressed concerns about the potential impact on American credibility and influence, stating that the United States needs to focus on the challenges of the present and future rather than remaining in Afghanistan indefinitely. He emphasized the need to address cybersecurity, competition with China, global health, and emerging technologies. Biden argued that staying longer in Afghanistan without a clear timetable for departure carries significant risks and costs, both in terms of lives and resources. He concluded by expressing his gratitude and support for the men and women of the United States Armed Forces who have served in Afghanistan, as well as the families who have sacrificed alongside them.
