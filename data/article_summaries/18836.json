The article discusses the recent elections in Sudan and the United States' response to them. According to independent electoral observers, the elections did not meet international standards. Political rights and freedoms were limited, there were reports of intimidation and violence in South Sudan, and the ongoing conflict in Darfur created an unfavorable environment for acceptable elections. Additionally, there were technical issues and serious irregularities in the voting process. The United States expresses regret that the Sudanese National Elections Commission did not address these problems adequately before the elections. However, the people of Sudan are commended for their efforts to make the elections peaceful and meaningful. Looking ahead, it is important to continue advocating for the civil and political rights of all Sudanese people, even after the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) expires. The United States remains committed to working with the international community to implement outstanding elements of the CPA, ensure the referendum happens on time, and promote peace, security, and accountability in Darfur.
