The President of the United States has issued a statement regarding the Senate's bipartisan vote on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). The President believes that these measures are crucial for negotiating and enforcing strong trade agreements, which will benefit the middle class, American workers, and the country's businesses. The TPA legislation includes provisions to protect workers' rights, the environment, and the free and open Internet. It also addresses unfair currency practices. The TAA extension is aimed at helping all American workers participate in the global economy. The President thanks Senators from both parties for supporting these measures and urges the House of Representatives to pass them as soon as possible.
