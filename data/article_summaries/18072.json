This article discusses President Obama's efforts to strengthen overtime protections for American workers. The article highlights how the overtime rules that establish the 40-hour workweek have eroded over the years, leaving millions of salaried workers without overtime pay or even the minimum wage. The Department of Labor has the authority to define exceptions to these rules, and one commonly used exemption is for "white collar" employees. However, the threshold for this exemption has not kept up with inflation, leaving many low-paid, salaried workers without basic protections. The article also mentions that states like New York and California have set higher salary thresholds to address this issue. In response, President Obama has directed the Secretary of Labor to update the overtime regulations to better protect workers and simplify the rules for both workers and businesses.
