The Department of Education has extended the pause on federal student loan repayments until January 31, 2022. This pause was initially implemented in January and has provided relief for millions of Americans who were facing financial difficulties due to the pandemic. By extending the pause, the government aims to give borrowers and the Department of Education more time and certainty as they prepare to resume student loan payments. The extension will also help minimize loan defaults and delinquencies, which can have negative impacts on families and the overall economic recovery.
