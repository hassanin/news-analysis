President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed July 27, 2021, as National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day to honor and give thanks to the Korean War veterans. The United States and the Republic of Korea have a long-standing alliance, with 1.8 million Americans joining the fight to defend South Korea from communist regimes in North Korea and China. After three years of violent combat and millions of casualties, an armistice was signed in 1953, but a peaceful settlement has not been reached, and the Korean Peninsula remains divided. Despite this, the Republic of Korea has thrived, and the relationship between the two nations has flourished. American service members, along with United Nations counterparts, fought with courage, resilience, and perseverance in challenging terrain and weather conditions. The battles fought, such as the Inchon, Chosin Reservoir, Heartbreak Ridge, and Pusan Perimeter, are remembered for their valor. The Medal of Honor was recently awarded to Colonel Ralph Puckett Jr., USA (Ret.), for his heroism in the Battle of Hill 205. A Wall of Remembrance will be established on the National Mall to honor the more than 36,000 American lives lost and the 7,000 Korean soldiers killed in action during the war. The commitment to protecting peace on the Korean Peninsula remains strong, and the partnership between the United States and the Republic of Korea is crucial for maintaining peace, stability, and economic growth in the region. President Biden calls upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor Korean War veterans.
