The article discusses the efforts being made to fight against breast cancer in Washington, D.C. The funds raised this year will go to the Howard University Cancer Center's Patient Navigation Team. Patient navigators help guide cancer patients through their journey, providing support and assistance in areas such as transportation, childcare, and treatment options. The article also mentions the disparities in access to life-saving treatments, particularly for communities of color, low-income areas, and rural locations. The Biden Cancer Moonshot initiative aims to address these disparities and create a world where cancer is not a death sentence, regardless of one's zip code. Progress has been made, such as new draft recommendations for breast cancer screenings to start at age 40, and the launch of a program by the National Cancer Institute to provide patient navigation for families with children with cancer. The article emphasizes the personal connection that many individuals have with cancer and the need for immediate action to improve care and find better solutions and treatments. The goal of the Biden Cancer Moonshot is to end cancer as we know it.
