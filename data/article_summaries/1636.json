President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to the Central African Republic, declared in Executive Order 13667 on May 12, 2014, will continue beyond May 12, 2023. The situation in the Central African Republic is characterized by a breakdown of law and order, sectarian tension, the forced recruitment and use of child soldiers, and widespread violence and atrocities. Entities such as the Wagner Group, linked to the Kremlin and Yevgeniy Prigozhin, have been involved in these activities. These dynamics pose a threat to the peace, security, and stability of the Central African Republic and neighboring states, as well as a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
