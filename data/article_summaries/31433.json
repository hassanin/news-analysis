The United States has welcomed the agreement between the Palestinian Authority and Israeli government regarding the allocation of water from the Red-Dead Sea Conveyance Project. The agreement states that the Palestinian Authority will receive 32 million cubic meters of water, with 22 million cubic meters for the West Bank and 10 million cubic meters for the Gaza Strip. This agreement is part of the Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2013 by Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority, which aims to construct a desalination plant in Aqaba to provide fresh water to Jordan and Israel and reduce the decline of the Dead Sea. The United States, under the leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Special Representative for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt, has supported the Israeli and Palestinian efforts to reach this agreement. The Trump administration considers achieving a lasting peace agreement between Israel and Palestine as a top priority and believes that peace is possible. This agreement is another example that shows the parties' capability to work together for mutual benefits and advance peace.
