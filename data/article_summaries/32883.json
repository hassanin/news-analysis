The article discusses a background briefing on the executive order titled "Buy American and Hire American," which is set to be signed the following day in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The executive order aims to strengthen Buy American policies and ensure proper protections for American workers in the immigration, visa, and guest worker programs. The order will call for strict enforcement of all laws governing entry into the United States for labor from abroad, with the goal of creating higher wages and employment rates for American workers. It also calls for the Departments of Labor, Justice, Homeland Security, and State to crack down on fraud and abuse in the immigration system. Additionally, the executive order addresses the H1B visa program and calls for reforms to reward visas to the most skilled or highest-paid applicants. The order also directs agencies to conduct top-to-bottom assessments of their compliance with Buy American laws and to minimize waivers and exceptions to these laws. The Secretary of Commerce will coordinate these efforts and submit a report to the President within 220 days. The executive order also reaffirms the melted and poured standard for U.S. steel production.
