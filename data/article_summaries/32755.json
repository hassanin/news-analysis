President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on January 22, 2018, in honor of National School Choice Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of education policies that support American children in achieving their dreams through hard work and personal integrity. It recognizes the need for diverse career goals and academic needs of students in different communities. The proclamation highlights the United States as one of the most educated countries in the world, with almost 90 percent of American adults attaining a high school diploma or GED. However, it states that students deserve access to an education that prepares them for the challenges of the future. The proclamation promotes the idea of school choice, which includes various options such as traditional public, public charter, private, magnet, parochial, virtual, and homeschooling. It argues that school choice not only benefits families who participate in these programs but also improves the performance of nearby public schools. The proclamation emphasizes the administration's commitment to empowering those most affected by school choice decisions, such as states, local school boards, and families. It mentions the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes an expansion of 529 education savings plans to allocate funds tax-free to K-12 public, private, and religious educational expenses. The proclamation urges parents to explore innovative educational alternatives, challenges students to dream big and work hard, and calls on lawmakers to embrace school choice and enact policies that empower families and strengthen communities. Finally, the proclamation designates January 21 to January 27, 2018, as National School Choice Week.
