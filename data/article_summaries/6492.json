The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has introduced a new model that harmonizes various measures of inflation, allowing for a more accurate comparison across G7 countries. Inflation in the United States has declined since last summer and currently stands at four percent year-on-year. However, comparing inflation across countries is challenging due to different measurement methods. One significant difference is the treatment of owner-occupied housing. In the U.S., the Bureau of Labor Statistics includes owners' equivalent rent as part of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), while Canada incorporates mortgage interest costs and housing replacement costs. In Europe, owner-occupied housing rents are excluded entirely from the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). These differences have implications for comparing inflation across borders, as owner-occupied housing can make up a significant share of the consumer price basket. Another difference is the definition of "core" inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. The precise definition of "core" varies by country, further complicating international comparisons. The CEA has harmonized inflation data for G7 countries using a common European HICP definition, excluding the direct costs of owner-occupied housing but including rental costs and repair costs. The data shows that U.S. inflation rose and peaked earlier than in other G7 countries, and the U.S. now has the lowest 12-month harmonized inflation in the G7. However, the near-term evolution of inflation remains uncertain. Harmonizing inflation data using shared definitions is crucial for accurately comparing inflation across countries.
