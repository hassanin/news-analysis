This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe. The national emergency was declared in 2003 and aims to deal with the threat to the foreign policy of the United States caused by certain actions and policies of the Government of Zimbabwe and other individuals. These actions and policies have led to the breakdown of the rule of law, political violence, intimidation, and economic instability in Zimbabwe and the southern African region. The President has issued executive orders over the years to expand the scope of the national emergency and block the property of individuals engaged in undermining democratic processes, facilitating corruption, or committing human rights abuses. The President has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
