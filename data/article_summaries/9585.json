This article is a memorandum from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, dated October 9, 2014. It discusses the provision of U.S. drug interdiction assistance to the government of Brazil. The memorandum states that the President, under the authority vested in him by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, certifies that the interdiction of aircraft involved in illicit drug trafficking in Brazil's airspace is necessary due to the significant threat it poses to Brazil's national security. It also states that Brazil has appropriate procedures in place to prevent innocent loss of life during these interdictions, including effective means to identify and warn aircraft before the use of force is employed. The Secretary of State is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register and inform Congress of this decision. The memorandum is signed by President Barack Obama.
