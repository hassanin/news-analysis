On the 31st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), President Joe Biden reaffirmed the commitment of his administration to upholding and strengthening the protections provided by the landmark law. The ADA, passed on July 26, 1990, ensures equal opportunity, economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and equitable participation for people with disabilities in all aspects of American life. It has made communities, the economy, and the country stronger and more vibrant over the past three decades. Despite the progress made, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequities and biases faced by people with disabilities, leading to increased risks and challenges. The Biden administration aims to address these issues through various initiatives. The American Rescue Plan provides funding to expand access to home- and community-based services, while the Build Back Better agenda proposes significant investments in these services and the creation of quality jobs for caregivers. The administration also seeks to advance the rights of people with disabilities in the workplace, including eliminating outdated provisions that allow employers to pay workers with disabilities less than the minimum wage. Furthermore, the Federal Government aims to lead by example in promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workforce. President Biden's administration remains committed to including and honoring the dignity of Americans with disabilities in all policies, as the nation works to recover and rebuild.
