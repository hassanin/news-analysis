The article is a readout of a meeting between President Obama, Ambassador Chris Hill, and General Ray Odierno regarding the situation in Iraq.

President Obama expressed his view that it is time for Iraq's leaders to form a government without delay and welcomed reports that security incidents in Iraq are at the lowest level since records have been kept.
