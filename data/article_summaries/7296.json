The U.S. government will hold a two-day Defense Industrial Base Conference on December 6th â€“ 7th, bringing together representatives from the U.S. and Ukraine to discuss co-production and other forms of industrial cooperation in Ukraine. The aim is to increase weapons production to support Ukraine's fight for freedom and security. Attendees will include representatives from the National Security Council and the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Defense, and State, as well as Ukrainian counterparts from the Office of the President and Ministries of Defense, Strategic Industry, and Foreign Affairs. This conference builds on the International Defense Industries Forum hosted by Ukraine in September and demonstrates the U.S.'s long-term commitment to the U.S. defense industrial base, Ukraine's economic recovery, and enhancing industrial, armaments, and security cooperation between the two countries.
