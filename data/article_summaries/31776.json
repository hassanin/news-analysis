Ireland's Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, is visiting President Trump at the White House for St. Patrick's Day. This visit continues a long tradition of Irish prime ministers visiting the United States to mark the holiday. The tradition began in 1952 when Ireland's ambassador to Washington sent President Truman a box of shamrocks. By the 1990s, a St. Patrick's Day visit from the Irish leader had become an annual tradition. During his visit, Varadkar plans to promote Ireland and deepen the country's connection to the US. President Trump has declared March as Irish-American Heritage Month, acknowledging the contributions of Irish immigrants and their descendants to American history.
