President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate stating that the national emergency with respect to Lebanon, which was declared in Executive Order 13441 in 2007, is to continue beyond August 1, 2013. The ongoing activities, such as arms transfers to Hizballah, are seen as undermining Lebanese sovereignty and contributing to instability in the region. The President believes that these activities pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
