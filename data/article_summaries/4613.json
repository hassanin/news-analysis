The Biden-Harris Administration has released the National Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR) and its Implementation Plan (NSARIP), outlining their ambitious climate and conservation agenda for the Arctic over the next decade. The NSAR addresses the climate crisis and emphasizes sustainable development while protecting the environment. It also aims to balance cooperation and collaboration in the region with increasing strategic competition, particularly from Russia and China. The NSARIP serves as a blueprint for implementing the NSAR, with over 30 objectives and 200 actions to advance the four pillars of the National Strategy. The plan includes lead and supporting agencies, external partners, timelines, and measures for progress. The Implementation Plan will be periodically updated as conditions in the Arctic change.
