This article is a proclamation issued by President Donald J. Trump on August 29, 2018 regarding the imports of aluminum articles and their impact on national security. The Secretary of Commerce had previously conducted an investigation and concluded that the imports of aluminum articles threatened the national security of the United States. In response, the President had imposed a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on these imports from most countries. The Secretary is now authorized to provide relief from quantitative limitations on aluminum articles if they are not produced in sufficient quantity or of satisfactory quality in the United States, or for specific national security considerations. The current tariff and quota levels will be maintained, and discussions with other countries are ongoing to address the national security concerns posed by aluminum article imports. The President has the authority under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to adjust imports that threaten national security. The proclamation also outlines procedures for requesting relief from import restrictions, the requirement of export certification for certain products, and modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Any previous proclamations or executive orders inconsistent with this proclamation are superseded.
