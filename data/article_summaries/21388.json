This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe will continue. The national emergency was declared in 2003 due to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe, who were undermining democratic processes or institutions. These actions have led to a breakdown in the rule of law, political violence, and economic instability in the southern African region. The President has issued executive orders to block the property of individuals involved in undermining democratic processes in Zimbabwe. The notice states that the national emergency will continue for another year, as these actions and policies still pose a threat to the foreign policy of the United States.
