This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on May 25, 2018, aims to exempt certain contracts and contract-like instruments entered into with the Federal Government from Executive Order 13658. The latter order established a minimum wage for contractors working on Federal lands. The exemption applies specifically to contracts or instruments related to seasonal recreational services or seasonal recreational equipment rental for the general public on Federal lands. However, the exemption does not apply to lodging and food services associated with seasonal recreational services. The order directs executive departments and agencies to promptly implement this exemption and ensure that regulations and guidance are consistent with it. It also states that the order should be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. Finally, the order clarifies that it does not create any substantive or procedural rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States or any other entity.
