President Biden is set to meet with Colombian President Iv√°n Duque at the White House to discuss various issues, including security cooperation, combating dissident groups, protecting Colombian elections, and addressing the Venezuela refugee and migration crisis. The two leaders will also review cooperation on counter-narcotics efforts and preparations for the upcoming Summit of the Americas. The senior administration officials emphasized the importance of the U.S.-Colombia relationship and Colombia's leadership in the region, particularly in managing migration. They also mentioned concerns about Russian influence in Latin America and the need for free and fair elections in Colombia. The officials denied any quid pro quo in the recent talks with Venezuela and expressed support for a negotiated outcome in Venezuela to restore democratic order. The timing of the visit to Venezuela was influenced by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Colombian government was informed about the visit after it took place.
