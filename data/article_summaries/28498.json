President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation recognizing Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. The proclamation highlights the achievements and contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in various fields, including the arts, literature, sports, science, medicine, technology, education, farming, and government. The proclamation also pays tribute to individuals like Dr. Sammy Lee, the first Asian American man to win an Olympic gold medal, and Katherine Sui Fun Cheung, the first Chinese American woman to earn a pilot license. President Trump encourages all Americans to learn more about the heritage of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, and to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
