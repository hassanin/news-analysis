Data released by the Census Bureau shows that 2019 was a historic year for raising Americans' living standards. Real median household income reached a record high of $68,700, with a 6.8% one-year increase, the largest on record. Minority groups, including black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans, experienced the largest income gains. Income inequality also decreased for the second consecutive year, with the Gini index of income inequality falling from 0.489 to 0.484. The number of workers increased, particularly women, contributing to the rise in income. In addition, the official poverty rate fell to a record low of 10.5%, with over 4 million people lifted out of poverty, the largest reduction in over 50 years. Poverty rates also decreased for minority groups, with the black poverty rate falling below 20% for the first time in history. Child poverty reached a near 50-year low. Between 2016 and 2019, 6.6 million people were lifted out of poverty, the largest 3-year reduction since the War on Poverty in 1964. However, it is important to note that data collection efforts for these estimates were affected by COVID-19. Despite the pandemic's disruptions, the Census Bureau's data highlights the positive impact of pro-growth policies under the Trump Administration.
