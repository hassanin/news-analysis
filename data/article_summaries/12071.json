The article discusses an executive order signed by President Obama to promote and encourage the sharing of cybersecurity threat information between the private sector and government. The order aims to facilitate collaboration within the private sector and with the federal government to quickly identify and protect against cyber threats. It encourages the development of information sharing and analysis organizations (ISAOs) as focal points for sharing cybersecurity information. The Department of Homeland Security will fund the creation of a non-profit organization to develop voluntary standards for ISAOs. The executive order also streamlines the mechanism for the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) to enter into information sharing agreements with ISAOs. It also enables private sector companies to access classified cybersecurity threat information and includes strong privacy and civil liberties protections. The executive order complements the administration's legislative proposal and paves the way for new legislation to incentivize and expand information sharing.
