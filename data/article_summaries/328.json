Last year, the author traveled to Tulsa, Oklahoma to shed light on a dark part of history. They met with survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, where a thriving Black neighborhood was destroyed by a white supremacist mob. The author emphasizes that this was not a riot, but a massacre, with hundreds of Black Americans killed and thousands left destitute. The destruction of homes, businesses, and churches resulted in the loss of a generation of Black wealth. The article discusses the systemic discrimination that followed, locking Black residents out of opportunities and perpetuating the attack on Black families and wealth across generations. The author visited Greenwood to break the silence and called for reflection on domestic terrorism and hate in the nation, as well as a commitment to combatting systemic racism. The author announced efforts to combat racial discrimination in housing and increase federal contracts for disadvantaged businesses, including those owned by Black and brown individuals. The administration has taken several actions to address bias in home appraisals and strengthen lending programs to counter the impact of discrimination. The author concludes by stating that a great nation does not hide from its history, and by confronting and remedying past injustices, America will become even greater.
