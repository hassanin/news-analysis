President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, stating that the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, which was declared in Executive Order 12978 on October 21, 1995, will continue beyond October 21, 2016. The circumstances that led to the declaration of the national emergency have not been resolved, and the actions of significant narcotics traffickers in Colombia continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, as well as causing violence, corruption, and harm both domestically and internationally. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
