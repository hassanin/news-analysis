The White House Office of the Press Secretary issued a press briefing on June 22, 2010, summarizing a meeting between President Obama and President Karzai. The two leaders discussed plans to stabilize Kandahar City and improve security, governance, and economic opportunities in the region. They also agreed on the importance of the long-term relationship between the US and Afghanistan and planned to discuss a new strategic partnership declaration. The briefing also addressed the controversial comments made by General McChrystal and his aides, with Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stating that the President had not yet spoken with McChrystal but had asked him to explain his remarks. Gibbs emphasized the need for unity and focus on implementing the agreed-upon strategy in Afghanistan. The briefing also touched on the resignation of Peter Orszag, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
