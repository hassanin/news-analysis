The article discusses various points related to immigration. The first point suggests limiting family-based green cards to only spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, thus ending chain migration. The second point proposes establishing a point-based system for awarding green cards, which would prioritize U.S. workers and taxpayers, encourage assimilation, and ensure the financial self-sufficiency of newcomers. The third point suggests eliminating the "diversity visa" lottery, which randomly awards 50,000 green cards to foreign nationals, many of whom have no ties to the United States, limited education, and no special skills. Lastly, the article argues for setting the number of refugees at an appropriate level that aligns with American priorities, acknowledging that the United States already accepts a significant number of refugees but suggesting a need for realignment.
