President Donald Trump has signed into law the Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019. However, he has expressed concerns about certain provisions that restrict his authority as Commander in Chief. These provisions limit his control over military personnel and equipment and require him to notify Congress and wait before making certain military decisions. The President asserts that he will implement these provisions consistent with his authority. He also disagrees with a provision that allows the congressional defense committees to veto a proposed modification of a command structure. The President views this as a violation of the INS v. Chadha ruling and will consider it as advisory and non-binding. Another provision that requires approval from congressional appropriations committees before transferring funds is seen by the President as a violation of separation of powers. He will treat it as requiring only 15 days' advance notice. The President also objects to provisions that condition his authority to spend funds on consultation with congressional committees, as well as provisions that could be interpreted as prohibiting him from recommending certain legislation. He states that his Administration will treat these requirements as advisory. Lastly, the President notes that provisions authorizing benefits based on race, ethnicity, or gender will be treated in a manner consistent with equal protection under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution's Fifth Amendment.
