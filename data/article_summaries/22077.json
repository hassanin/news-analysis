During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest discussed the ongoing negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. He stated that progress was being made and that talks were continuing to be productive. However, he also made it clear that the negotiations were not open-ended and that Iran needed to make serious commitments to shut down every path to a nuclear weapon. Earnest emphasized that the US and the international community were prepared to walk away from the negotiations if Iran did not meet these expectations. He also mentioned that if a deal was reached, it would be important to communicate the details to Congress, the American people, and the international community. Additionally, Earnest addressed other topics such as the situation in Iraq, the religious objections bills in Arkansas and Indiana, and the Presidentâ€™s upcoming visits to Kentucky and Utah.
