President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation establishing the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument in Washington, D.C. The monument is located at the Sewall-Belmont House, which has been the headquarters of the National Woman's Party (NWP) since 1929. The house played a significant role in the fight for women's rights, with founder Alice Paul drafting new language for the Equal Rights Amendment and leading the fight for its passage in Congress. Throughout the 20th century, Paul and the NWP drafted over 600 pieces of legislation in support of equal rights and advocated for women's political, social, and economic equality. The proclamation reserves approximately 0.34 acres of land owned or controlled by the Federal Government for the monument and directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage the monument through the National Park Service. A management plan will be developed to preserve and protect the historic objects associated with the monument and interpret the women's rights movement. The National Park Service will seek agreements with the NWP and others to address common interests and promote management efficiencies.
