President Donald J. Trump has signed an executive order to protect and preserve the nation's history from mob violence. The order directs the enforcement of laws that carry firm penalties, including incarceration, for those found guilty of desecrating public monuments. The order also provides assistance for the protection of federal monuments, memorials, statues, and property. Under this order, the federal government is directed to prosecute anyone who damages or defaces religious property and withhold certain federal support from state and local governments that fail to protect public monuments. The President aims to prevent violence from controlling the streets, rewriting history, or harming the American way of life.
