The Senate has confirmed Steve Dettelbach as the first permanent head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in over 7 years. Dettelbach is a highly qualified career prosecutor with support from both Republican and Democratic administrations, as well as law enforcement organizations. This confirmation is seen as a bipartisan step in supporting law enforcement and addressing gun violence. The passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the confirmation of Dettelbach are seen as important actions to combat gun violence. The article also mentions the need for further measures such as banning assault weapons, expanding background checks, and implementing safe storage laws. The administration plans to continue taking executive actions to fight crime and save lives, with Dettelbach playing a leading role in implementing these actions as the ATF Director.
