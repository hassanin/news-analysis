During a joint press conference in Japan, Vice President Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Aso discussed the launch of the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue, which aims to deepen bilateral economic ties and foster jobs and growth. They discussed three key policy pillars: a common strategy on trade and investment rules and issues, cooperation on economic and structural policy, and sectoral cooperation. Pence reiterated that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a thing of the past for the United States, but emphasized the importance of bilateral trade negotiations. Pence also stated that the United States is committed to increasing diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, while also expressing a willingness to engage in dialogue with North Korea if it leads to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Aso addressed concerns about burden sharing in the U.S.-Japan security relationship, stating that Japan is already providing substantial support and that there have been no complaints from the U.S. regarding Japan's defense expenditure.
