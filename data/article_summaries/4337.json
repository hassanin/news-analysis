During the North American Leaders' Summit, President Joe Biden, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau established a Trilateral Fentanyl Committee to address the illicit fentanyl threat in North America. The committee, led by U.S. Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, Mexican Secretary of Security Rosa Icela Rodríguez, and Canadian National Security and Intelligence Advisor Jody Thomas, identified synthetic opioids, particularly fentanyl, as the primary drug threat in the region. The committee will focus on coordinating efforts in four areas: current and emerging synthetic drugs, drug demand and public health, drug trafficking modes and methods, and illicit finance. The three governments will work together to disrupt the global transfer and supply of illicit fentanyl, precursor chemicals, and production equipment. They also pledged to coordinate with other countries affected by synthetic drugs, enhance drug surveillance capabilities, and share best practices. Furthermore, the governments will develop recommendations on chemical diversion reporting by private industries and establish a shared understanding of the legitimate use of synthetic precursors. The three countries committed to meeting again in the summer and building on existing frameworks of cooperation. The delegations from Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. included various high-level officials from their respective governments.
