President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama extend their greetings to Muslims worldwide on the occasion of Eid al-Adha and congratulate those performing Hajj. They acknowledge the participation of thousands of Muslim Americans in the pilgrimage to Mecca and nearby sites. Muslims celebrating Eid will also commemorate Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son by distributing food to the less fortunate around the world. They join the United States and the international community in relief efforts for those struggling in the Horn of Africa and Turkey. The rituals of Eid and Hajj serve as a reminder of the shared roots of the world's Abrahamic faiths and the importance of faith in motivating communities to serve and stand with those in need. The President and First Lady extend their best wishes during this Hajj season, expressing "Eid Mubarak" and "Hajj Mabrour."
