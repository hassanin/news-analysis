President Trump's Operation Warp Speed has developed vaccines at a record-breaking speed, five times faster than any previous effort. The vaccines have been made available to all Americans for free. Around 20 million first doses have been allocated to states for immediate administration, and the process is progressing quickly. Additionally, hundreds of millions of doses have been secured for future delivery. President Trump has utilized the Defense Production Act 18 times to accelerate vaccine manufacturing and save lives. Despite partisan criticism, the President's focus on delivering results ensures a promising future for the country.
