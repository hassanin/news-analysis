In this press gaggle, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs discusses the Obama administration's efforts to pass a recovery plan to stimulate the economy and create jobs. He mentions that there is internal polling being done, but he hasn't seen the results. Gibbs emphasizes the need to bring Washington's perspective to the rest of the country, particularly states like Indiana that have been hit hard by unemployment. He also talks about the similarities between the House and Senate plans, and that the focus should be on creating jobs rather than getting votes. He mentions that there may be a prime time address in the future but for now, they are focused on travel. Gibbs also briefly mentions Vice President Biden's trip to Germany and the administration's policy on missile defense, as well as David Plouffe's trip to Azerbaijan, clarifying that he is there as a private citizen.
