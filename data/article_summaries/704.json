The Vice President is traveling to Japan and the Republic of Korea on a trip that has three main purposes: to honor the legacy of Prime Minister Abe and support the Japanese people as they mourn his assassination, to reaffirm the United States' commitment to its allies in a complex security environment, and to deepen overall engagement in the Indo-Pacific region. In Japan, the Vice President will have bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Kishida and other world leaders attending the funeral, including Prime Minister Albanese of Australia and Prime Minister Han of the Republic of Korea. The Vice President will also attend the state funeral for Prime Minister Abe and pay respects on behalf of President Biden and the American people. In addition, she will meet with Japanese business executives to discuss the CHIPS and Science Act and its benefits for the United States, allies, and partners. The Vice President will also visit Yokosuka Naval Base and deliver remarks on the importance of the U.S. military presence in ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. In South Korea, the Vice President will have a bilateral meeting with President Yoon and participate in a roundtable discussion with influential Korean women to address gender equity issues. The trip aims to strengthen alliances, discuss regional and global challenges, and advance economic and security cooperation. The Vice President is expected to discuss the Taiwan Strait issue with leaders in both Japan and South Korea, and the United States remains aligned with its allies on this matter. There is no specific announcement or deliverables planned for the trip, but the focus is on advancing the U.S.-Japan alliance and addressing mutual concerns. The Vice President's visit to South Korea does not currently include plans to visit USFK installations, but she will have the opportunity to engage with troops.
