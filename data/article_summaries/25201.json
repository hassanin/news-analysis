The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has criticized the Penn-Wharton Budget Model's estimates of the growth effects from the President's infrastructure plan. The CEA argues that the model is flawed in two critical ways. Firstly, the model assumes a "closed economy" where only US savings can fund investment in the US, ignoring the possibility of foreign investment. Secondly, the model assumes that US savings are insufficient to meet new investment demand, which the CEA disagrees with, suggesting that there is actually too much savings chasing too few investment opportunities in the US. The CEA also criticizes the model's assumption that public capital expenditures generate lower returns on investment than the evidence suggests. The CEA argues that the model's estimates of the growth effects of infrastructure spending are biased to be lower than what the academic literature suggests. Furthermore, the CEA disputes the Penn-Wharton model's characterization of the President's proposed framework, claiming that it does not accurately model the framework and misrepresents its incentives for states to invest in public infrastructure. The CEA argues that the President's Incentives Program avoids substitution by valuing new revenue as the most important driver for awards and provides incentives for states and localities raising new revenue for infrastructure. The CEA also criticizes the Penn-Wharton study for not accounting for the leverage that can be achieved through Federal credit programs, underestimating the multiplier effect of the Federal dollar.
