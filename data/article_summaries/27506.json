President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, which was declared in Executive Order 12978 in 1995, will continue beyond October 21, 2018. Trump believes that the circumstances that led to the declaration of the national emergency still exist, and that the actions of these traffickers pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
