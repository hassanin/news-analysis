The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a statement expressing appreciation for the bipartisan work of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. The bill aims to assist the Armed Forces in operating in unconventional and irregular warfare, countering unconventional threats, and supporting capacity building efforts with foreign military forces. It also addresses concerns regarding foreign transfers of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, providing the Administration with more flexibility in transferring detainees abroad. The Administration commends Congress for their efforts to prevent sexual assault, strengthen protections for victims, and extend compensation and benefits for service members. While the bill includes provisions that restrict the Defense Department's ability to align military capabilities and force structure with the President's strategy, the Administration is overall pleased with the modifications and improvements in the bill and supports its passage.
