The U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Education are collaborating to make $100 million available for Youth CareerConnect grants. These grants aim to provide high school students with industry-relevant education and skills to prepare them for a successful future. The program will focus on integrated academic and career-focused learning, work-based learning and exposure to the world of work, robust employer engagement, individualized career and academic counseling, and integration of post-secondary education and training. Grants will be awarded to local education agencies, workforce entities, or non-profits with education reform experience. Applicants are required to demonstrate a strong public/private partnership and provide a match of 25% of the grant award. The grants will be funded by revenues from the H-1B visa program, and awards are anticipated to be made in early 2014. This initiative aligns with the President's broader agenda to strengthen education and prepare young people for college and careers.
