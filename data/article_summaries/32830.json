President Donald Trump is empowering state and local leaders to decide how to rebuild America's aging infrastructure. His "Building a Stronger America" initiative aims to invest wisely at the state, local, tribal, and private levels, with a focus on developing rural America. The administration plans to remove regulatory barriers, streamline permitting, fast-track construction, and strengthen the workforce. One of the key areas of investment will be in energy infrastructure, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. The government aims to shorten the permitting review process to two years or less, while still protecting the environment. The President believes that communities should set priorities based on their unique needs and goals, and wants to reduce federal interference in rebuilding America.
