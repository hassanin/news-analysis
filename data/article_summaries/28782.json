President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump participated in the 95th annual National Christmas Tree Lighting, held on November 30. The tradition of the National Christmas Tree began in 1923, and it has become a symbol of peace. The tree lighting ceremony now includes a three-week event called the "Christmas Pageant of Peace," where visitors can walk "The Pathway of Peace" surrounded by smaller trees representing 56 U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia. In his remarks, President Trump emphasized the importance of remembering the religious character of Christmas, while also celebrating its universal themes. He expressed gratitude to the military, law enforcement, community servants, religious leaders, and families, calling them the bedrock of American life. The National Christmas Tree lighting tradition has served as a symbol of hope throughout the years, even during times of hardship, such as World War II.
