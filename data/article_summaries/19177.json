Yoani Sanchez, a prominent advocate for freedom of information in Cuba, has been allowed to travel outside of Cuba for the first time in many years. She recently visited the United States and met with White House staff, including Ricardo Zuniga, to discuss her efforts to promote freedom of expression in Cuba. The United States supports policies that encourage the free flow of information to and from Cuba and hopes for a day when all Cubans can express themselves without fear.
