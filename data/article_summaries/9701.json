The joint statement highlights the importance of the transatlantic relationship, which accounts for half of global economic output and supports millions of jobs. The statement acknowledges that there is still more to be done to deepen and broaden these ties. The High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth has conducted a thorough assessment of options to expand trade and investment, and the report highlights the benefits of an ambitious and comprehensive market opening arrangement. The statement urges the group to complete its work quickly, including consultations with stakeholders, with the goal of reaching a recommendation to leaders later this year on whether to pursue negotiations.
