Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the Carole Hoefener Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, emphasizing the importance of women's reproductive rights and the need to protect them from government interference. She praised Governor Roy Cooper for his support and urged the legislature to provide him with the necessary support to hold the line on these issues. Harris argued that every woman should have the freedom to make decisions about her own body without government intervention, without having to abandon her faith or beliefs. She highlighted the risk posed by recent Supreme Court decisions and the implications for other issues such as contraception and same-sex marriage. Harris also criticized extremist leaders who are passing laws without exceptions for violent acts like rape and incest. She acknowledged President Biden's executive order to protect women's rights but emphasized the need for Congress to codify these protections into law. Harris thanked the leaders in North Carolina for their courage in standing up for women's rights and called for unity in the face of attacks on reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, and voting rights, which often come from the same source. She concluded by expressing her gratitude and eagerness to engage in discussions with the leaders present.
