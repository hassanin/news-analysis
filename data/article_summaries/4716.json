The White House Competition Council, consisting of eight Cabinet Secretaries and the Chairs of seven independent agencies, held its inaugural meeting to discuss actions taken to promote competition and lower costs for American families since the President issued the competition executive order. The Council members have met every deadline in the executive order and have taken actions to reduce prices in various industries. During the meeting, several agencies briefed the council on their work, including the Department of Transportation's efforts to secure refunds for travelers whose flights were canceled due to COVID-19. The President and First Lady will travel to the three sites of the 9/11 attacks to honor and memorialize the lives lost. The President will also visit the National Interagency Fire Center, survey wildfire damage in California, and participate in an event with Governor Gavin Newsom. In response to health concerns, U.S.-bound flights of Afghan evacuees from two key countries have been temporarily paused due to four diagnosed cases of measles among recently arrived Afghans. The President has taken a more aggressive tone in blaming the unvaccinated for the spread of COVID-19, citing the frustration of vaccinated individuals and the growing number of cases due to the Delta variant. The President's administration will provide resources to OSHA to help implement the vaccine mandate for businesses and will continue to look for ways to protect and save lives.
