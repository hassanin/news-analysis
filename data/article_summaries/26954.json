President Donald J. Trump has signed into law the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019." The Act reaffirms and amends the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, specifying US policy towards Hong Kong and directing assessment of political developments in the region. However, the President has stated that certain provisions of the Act could interfere with his constitutional authority to state foreign policy. As a result, his administration will treat each provision of the Act in accordance with his constitutional authorities regarding foreign relations.
