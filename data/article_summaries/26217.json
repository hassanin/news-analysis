President Donald J. Trump commends the House of Representatives for passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is a significant stride towards delivering substantial tax cuts for the American people. The goal is to enable middle-class families to retain more of their income and to provide businesses and employees with the tools to outperform their international rivals. A straightforward, equitable, and competitive tax system will greatly boost the economy, and achieving this objective is attainable. The time to take action is now.
