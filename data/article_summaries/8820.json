The Secretary of the Interior has certified that nationals of Mexico are engaging in trade or taking of totoaba and vaquita, which diminishes the effectiveness of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Despite Mexico's domestic ban on totoaba fishing, illegal harvesting and international trade in totoaba continues, primarily driven by demand in China. This illegal activity has led to a significant decline in the vaquita population, with fewer than 15 individuals remaining in the wild. Efforts to protect totoaba and vaquita are underway, including diplomatic dialogue, a CITES Compliance Action Plan, and partnership with a non-governmental organization to remove gillnets. However, these steps are insufficient to ensure the recovery of the vaquita. The US government will convene a high-level dialogue with Mexico, establish regular meetings to review CITES Compliance Action Plan implementation, and coordinate efforts to assist Mexico's compliance and anti-trafficking measures. An assessment of Mexico's enforcement actions and implementation of the CITES Compliance Action Plan will be conducted, and trade restrictions may be considered if necessary. The aim is to curtail illegal trade in totoaba and support conservation efforts.
