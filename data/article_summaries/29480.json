President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring May 7-13, 2017, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week in the United States. The proclamation aims to remind residents living in hurricane-prone areas of the importance of preparing their homes, communities, and families for extreme weather events before the hurricane season begins on June 1. The proclamation highlights the devastating impacts of past hurricanes, such as Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and emphasizes that inland areas are also at risk of destruction from flooding rains and related weather events. The National Weather Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency provide resources online to help individuals create evacuation and communication plans, assemble disaster kits, and take necessary steps to safeguard their families, homes, and businesses. The proclamation calls on federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial emergency management officials to raise awareness about hurricane preparedness and response to prevent storm damage and save lives.
