The United States is pleased with the news that Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders will resume settlement talks on May 15. They express their support for the UN-facilitated process and are willing to assist in any way that is helpful. The US encourages the parties to reach a settlement quickly in order to reunify the island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation, which would benefit all Cypriots and the wider region.
