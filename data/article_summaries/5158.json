On International Day of Persons with Disabilities, President Joe Biden reaffirms the commitment to creating a world where disabled individuals are treated with dignity, respect, and equal opportunities. He highlights the progress made in the United States, such as the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, which banned discrimination against disabled people in various areas. However, he acknowledges that more work needs to be done to ensure equal opportunities, as disabled Americans still face challenges in voting, accessing education, and enjoying public spaces, among other issues. The Biden Administration has taken steps to improve the lives of disabled Americans, including through the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The President also emphasizes the importance of upholding the rights and freedom of disabled individuals worldwide. He has released a memorandum on advancing labor rights for disabled people globally, launched a disability rights initiative, and reinstated the role of Special Advisor on International Disability Rights at the Department of State. The United States continues to advocate for the equal rights of disabled people internationally through its participation in global initiatives. President Biden concludes by urging the celebration of the dignity, resilience, and contributions of disabled individuals and calls on all Americans to observe the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
