The White House has announced a new online engagement feature called "We the People." This platform allows individuals to create and sign petitions to request action from the federal government on various issues. If a petition receives enough signatures, White House staff will review it, send it to the relevant policy experts, and issue an official response. Visitors to the White House website will be able to start submitting petitions later this month. To create a petition, users need to create an account and gather signatures from friends, family, and coworkers. The initial threshold for a petition to be considered is 5,000 signatures within 30 days. An official response will be published on the website and emailed to all signers of the petition. President Obama stated that this new feature aims to make the government more open and accountable to its citizens.
