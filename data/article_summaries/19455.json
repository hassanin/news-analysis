The United States recognizes the important role of the United Nations in strengthening nuclear security globally. The UN Security Council resolution 1540 and the International Convention on the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (ICSANT) are key elements of the international legal framework in combating nuclear terrorism. In 2004, the US co-sponsored UNSCR 1540, which requires all states to take measures to secure and protect nuclear materials. The US meets its obligations under this resolution and assists other states in meeting theirs. The US also supported the development of ICSANT through the UN General Assembly, which creates an international legal framework to combat nuclear terrorism and promote cooperation between states. The US works closely with various UN bodies to enhance nuclear security worldwide.
