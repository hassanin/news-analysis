The White House has announced a new Federal policy statement from the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Education on better supporting dual language learners (DLLs) in early childhood programs. The policy statement recognizes the cultural and linguistic assets of DLLs and provides resources and recommendations to ensure that early education programs are accessible to these families. Additionally, various organizations have made commitments to support DLLs, including the release of a DLL Electronic Toolkit by the Office of Head Start, a public awareness campaign in Miami, a $16 million DLL Pilot in California, and research reports on bilingual language learning and the economic benefits of bilingualism. These actions build on President Obama's broader agenda to expand access to high-quality early education for all children, which includes improving and expanding Head Start, launching the Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, and the Maternal Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, among other initiatives.
