The article discusses the importance of providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented individuals, specifically Dreamers, who were brought to the United States as children. It highlights that many Dreamers have spent most of their lives in the US, contributing to their communities by studying, working, and serving on the frontlines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, created in 2012, has allowed over 800,000 immigrant youth to temporarily remain in the country, work legally, and pursue education. However, the article emphasizes that only Congress can provide a permanent legislative solution to ensure stability for these young people and their families. It mentions the introduction of the bipartisan Dream Act twenty years ago, but despite bipartisan support and public backing, the Senate has failed to act. The author, in this case, supports the U.S. Citizenship Act, which includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented individuals, including Dreamers. The article concludes by urging Congress to pass legislative solutions, emphasizing that Dreamers represent the best of America and should not be let down.
