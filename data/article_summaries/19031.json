The White House is launching the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to help uninsured Americans gain coverage under the Affordable Care Act. The challenge aims to engage communities with high numbers or percentages of uninsured individuals and encourage them to build outreach efforts to reach these individuals. At the end of the enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of new Marketplace signups in participating communities to estimates of eligible uninsured people to determine the most successful communities. The winning community will receive a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success. In Virginia, 76% of people can find a plan for $100 or less, and tax credits have been beneficial, with 84% of enrollees receiving them and saving an average of $257 per month. It is noted that while progress has been made in reducing the uninsured rate, more work is needed, as there are still 59,000 uninsured individuals eligible for the Marketplace in Richmond and the surrounding region.
