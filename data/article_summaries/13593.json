President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama extend their warmest wishes to Muslims celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr. They acknowledge that Ramadan is a time for reflection, community building, and helping those in need. They recognize the diversity of traditions associated with Eid, such as special prayers, festive gatherings, gift exchanges, and feasts. The Obamas emphasize the importance of respecting all faiths and beliefs, citing the addition of Eid to the official school calendar in New York City as an example of inclusiveness. They also highlight the efforts of young Muslim Americans in promoting understanding and unity, including raising funds for churches affected by the shooting in Charleston. The Obamas hope that Eid brings joy to homes in the US and around the world.
