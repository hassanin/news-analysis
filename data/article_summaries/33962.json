Starting from January 24, 2020, the State Department will stop issuing temporary visitor visas to individuals traveling to the United States for "birth tourism," which is the practice of giving birth on American soil to secure automatic and permanent American citizenship for their children. This rule change is aimed at enhancing public safety, national security, and the integrity of the immigration system. The birth tourism industry is seen as a threat to hospital resources and is associated with criminal activity, as evidenced by federal prosecutions. Closing this loophole will address these abuses and protect the United States from the national security risks posed by this practice. Additionally, it will prevent American taxpayers from bearing the financial burden associated with birth tourism. The protection of American citizenship integrity is emphasized.
