The White House is preparing for the visit of King Salman of Saudi Arabia. The visit is seen as an important opportunity to discuss the recent Iran deal and to push back against Iranian activities in the region. The President and King Salman are expected to discuss ways to strengthen the partnership between the US and Saudi Arabia, particularly in the areas of security and stability in the Middle East. They will also discuss regional conflicts such as Yemen and Syria, and the need for political resolutions. The US is looking for Saudi Arabia to express support for the Iran deal while also addressing concerns about Iran's behavior in the region. The US is also seeking to enhance the capabilities of its Gulf partners, including Saudi Arabia, in areas such as maritime security, cyber security, and special forces capabilities. The US and Saudi Arabia will also discuss energy issues, but it is not expected to be the main focus of the visit. The US will express concerns about civilian casualties in Yemen and the urgent need for a political resolution to the conflict. The US will also discuss the role Saudi Arabia can play in the ongoing conflict in Syria, particularly in supporting the political process and the opposition forces. The US does not expect Saudi Arabia to pursue its own nuclear weapons program, as the Iran deal provides significant constraints on Iran's nuclear program. The US expects continued sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia, with a focus on developing new capabilities rather than just aircraft and ships. Overall, the visit will be an opportunity to strengthen the partnership between the US and Saudi Arabia and to address shared concerns in the region.
