On October 20, 2020, the President signed four laws related to veterans. The first law, H.R. 1812, known as the "Vet Center Eligibility Expansion Act," extends Vet Center readjustment counseling and mental health services to more individuals. The second law, H.R. 2372, called the "Veterans' Care Quality Transparency Act," requires the Government Accountability Office to assess certain VA suicide prevention and mental health service activities. The third law, H.R. 6168, known as the "Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2020," provides a cost-of-living adjustment for veterans' disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation beneficiaries. The adjustment is equal to the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. The fourth law, S. 1321, called the "Defending the Integrity of Voting Systems Act," expands the definition of a protected computer to include a voting system computer for the purpose of computer fraud and abuse offenses.
