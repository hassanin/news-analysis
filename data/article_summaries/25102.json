According to an article by John Melloy on CNBC, small business optimism in the United States has reached a record high in August. This surge in optimism is attributed to the tax cuts and deregulation efforts implemented by President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress. The National Federation of Independent Business conducted a survey which revealed that the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index reached 108.8 last month, surpassing the previous record of 108 set in 1983 during Ronald Reagan's presidency. The increase in optimism has resulted in more sales, hiring, and investment by small businesses.
