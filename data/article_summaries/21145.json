President Obama has declared an emergency in the state of North Carolina and authorized federal aid to assist with the response efforts following Hurricane Earl. The declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to save lives, protect property, and ensure public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to mobilize resources and equipment to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. The federal government will provide 75 percent of the funding for emergency protective measures. Michael Bolch has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area.
