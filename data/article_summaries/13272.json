President Barack Obama has sent a message to Congress regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism. He states that the crisis caused by acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism, including the attacks on September 11, 2001, has not been resolved. These actions continue to pose a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain the comprehensive sanctions to address this ongoing threat.
