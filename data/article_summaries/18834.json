The White House released a budget fact sheet in 2009 outlining the President's plans for the 2010 budget. The focus was on creating jobs, boosting the economy, and laying the foundation for long-term growth and prosperity. Key pillars of this foundation included investments in education, healthcare reform, and renewable energy. The budget also emphasized fiscal discipline, with a separate volume dedicated to identifying program terminations, reductions, and savings. The document listed ten programs that were deemed inefficient, wasteful, or outdated, including LORAN-C, Abandoned Mine Lands Payments, and the Christopher Columbus Fellowship Foundation. The fact sheet highlighted the President's efforts to cut waste, save taxpayer dollars, and make government more effective, such as an historic down payment on healthcare reform, cutting the deficit in half, and implementing contracting and administrative savings. The President aimed to work with Congress to reform and transform Washington, making necessary cuts to invest in what works for economic growth and prosperity.
