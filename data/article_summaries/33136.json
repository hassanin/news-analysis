This article is a proclamation by President Donald Trump regarding the adjustment of imports of aluminum articles into the United States. The proclamation states that imports of aluminum articles were found to threaten the national security of the United States, leading to the imposition of a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles from most countries. However, the United States has successfully concluded discussions with Canada and Mexico on alternative measures to address the threatened impairment of national security caused by aluminum imports from these countries. These measures include preventing unfair subsidies, dumped prices, transshipment, and import surges. As a result, imports of aluminum from Canada and Mexico will no longer be considered a threat to national security and will be excluded from the tariff. The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of these measures and may revisit the determination as appropriate. The proclamation also maintains the current tariff level for other countries.
