The President's recent directive regarding refugee admissions to the United States has caused confusion. Last week, he submitted his budget proposal for the next fiscal year, which aligns with his previous commitment. However, determining the number of refugees that can realistically be admitted before October 1 has been a challenge, given the state of the refugee admissions program and the burden on the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The initial goal of admitting 62,500 refugees seems unlikely. In the meantime, the President has been urged to reverse the Trump policy that banned refugees from certain regions, allowing flights from those regions to resume. This order was issued today. By May 15, it is expected that the President will establish a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal year.
