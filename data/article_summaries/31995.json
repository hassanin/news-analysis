The Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) is an organization that aims to honor and empower wounded veterans by connecting them to resources and support. They offer mental health and wellness programs, physical health activities, career and benefits counseling, and special support for severely injured veterans. One of their largest events is Soldier Ride, a four-day cycling experience that challenges veterans both physically and mentally while providing an opportunity to bond with other service members. Since 2008, U.S. Presidents have hosted participating wounded veterans, including President Donald Trump who will once again host Soldier Riders at the White House. The ride not only builds camaraderie and strength but also raises awareness about the lives of America's veterans.
