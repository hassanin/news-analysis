On August 25, 2021, the President signed two bills into law. The first is H.R. 1448, also known as the "PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act." This law requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to conduct a pilot program on dog training therapy and allows the VA to provide service dogs to eligible veterans. The second law is H.R. 3642, the "Harlem Hellfighters Congressional Gold Medal Act." This law awards a Congressional Gold Medal to the 369th Infantry Regiment, also known as the "Harlem Hellfighters," in recognition of their bravery and service during World War I. Senators and Representatives from various states were thanked for their support and leadership in passing these bills.
