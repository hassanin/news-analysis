First Lady Michelle Obama has announced a collaboration with Walmart in support of the Let's Move! campaign. The collaboration involves Walmart launching a Nutrition Charter, which aims to offer more nutritious food products, lower the cost of healthy foods, and provide consumers with better information about healthy food options. The Nutrition Charter is the result of over a year of work between Let's Move! and Walmart. The First Lady believes that this collaboration represents a victory for parents, families, and children, and shows that efforts can be made to improve the food industry and promote healthier eating habits. Walmart's Nutrition Charter consists of three major pillars: reformulating products to improve nutrition by 2015, making healthy food more affordable, and empowering consumers to make informed choices by implementing a healthy seal. The Partnership for a Healthier America will be working with Walmart to evaluate and monitor their progress. The Let's Move! campaign, launched by the First Lady almost a year ago, aims to combat childhood obesity and engage every sector of society to address the factors that contribute to it. In December, President Obama signed The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which improves the quality of school meals and strengthens nutrition programs for young children.
