Vice President Biden announced over $2 billion in anti-waste measures at a Cabinet meeting. The initiatives, led by the Campaign to Cut Waste, aim to save Medicaid waste and strengthen the partnership with states to reduce improper unemployment insurance payments. The Vice President discussed a new initiative to fight waste and fraud in Medicaid that is estimated to save taxpayers over $2 billion. The Department of Health and Human Services released its final rule for the Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractor Program, which is projected to save $2.1 billion over the next five years. The Vice President also unveiled new efforts by the Department of Labor to reduce improper Unemployment Insurance payments and hold states accountable for progress. These efforts include a transparency initiative to show each state's performance on improper payments and comprehensive turnaround plans for high-priority states. The Department of Labor also awarded nearly $192 million to 42 states to implement waste-cutting initiatives and improve the Unemployment Insurance program. Finally, the Vice President asked each Cabinet secretary to undertake a waste and efficiency review to target unnecessary, wasteful, and inefficient federal spending. The Department of Homeland Security's Efficiency Review was highlighted as a model effort. The Vice President will hold regular Cabinet waste cutting meetings and work with OMB Director Jack Lew and the Administration's Chief Performance Officer Jeffrey Zients to root out waste across agencies.
