The United States has welcomed a major prisoner exchange agreement announced in Geneva by the parties involved in the Yemen conflict. The deal will result in the release of 887 detainees connected to the war. This development is seen as a positive step and is built upon the truce in Yemen that has halted the fighting for the past 11 months. The US expresses gratitude to UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg and the International Committee of the Red Cross for their efforts in finalizing the agreement. Due to active US diplomacy, Yemen has experienced the lowest level of violence in over a decade. The US remains committed to further progress in resolving the conflict.
