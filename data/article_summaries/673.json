The Biden Administration is taking steps to protect critical infrastructure in the US from cyber threats. Recent attacks on infrastructure, such as the Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods ransomware attacks, have highlighted vulnerabilities in the private sector-owned infrastructure. The degradation or malfunction of these systems can have serious consequences for national security, economic security, and public health. Currently, cybersecurity regulation in the US is sectoral and fragmented. The government is now considering new approaches, both voluntary and mandatory, to improve cybersecurity. President Biden has signed a National Security Memorandum (NSM) called "Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems" to address this issue. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a second Security Directive for pipeline owners and operators to implement urgent protections. The government emphasizes that securing critical infrastructure requires a collaborative effort from the entire nation. The NSM, along with other initiatives, aims to address the significant threats posed by cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.
