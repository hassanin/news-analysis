Jared Kushner, Senior Adviser to President Donald J. Trump, spoke about the importance of interoperability in the healthcare system at the HIMSS18 conference. Interoperability refers to the ability of different computer systems to communicate with each other quickly and effectively. In the context of healthcare, it means being able to share patient data instantly and securely, regardless of where the information is housed. The Trump Administration sees interoperability as a top priority and wants the Federal government to lead by example. Kushner highlighted the challenge of exchanging medical records between the Department of Defense and the Veterans' Administration and emphasized the need for better access to patient data. He shared key principles from the Administration's strategy, including the importance of acting quickly and collaborating with healthcare innovators to make interoperability a reality.
