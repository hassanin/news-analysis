The United States is easing restrictions to allow U.S. companies to do business in Burma. This decision is in support of the progress that Burma has made towards democracy and the government's economic and political reforms. However, the U.S. government remains concerned about the lack of transparency in Burma's investment environment and the military's role in the economy. The armed forces and Ministry of Defense-owned entities will not be covered by the easing of sanctions. U.S. companies will be asked to report on their activities in line with international corporate governance standards. In addition, the President has signed an Executive Order that expands sanctions authorities for those who undermine the reform process, engage in human rights abuses, contribute to ethnic conflict, or participate in military trade with North Korea. This Order sends a clear message to Burmese government and military officials that those who engage in abusive, corrupt, or destabilizing behavior will not benefit from the rewards of reform. The easing of sanctions and responsible investment are aimed at facilitating economic development and bringing Burma out of isolation and into the international community. The U.S. government will continue to support Burma in its efforts to meet international standards for economic growth, governance, and human rights.
