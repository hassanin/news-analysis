Vice President Mike Pence will be traveling to Bogota, Colombia on behalf of President Donald Trump to show support for interim President Juan Guaido and the Venezuelan people's fight for democracy. He will deliver remarks at a meeting of the Lima Group, discussing the humanitarian and security crises in Venezuela and U.S. efforts to provide aid. Pence will meet with Colombian President Ivan Duque and other officials to define steps that support the Venezuelan people and a transition to democracy. He will also meet with Venezuelan families who have fled Maduro's regime. The trip will be Pence's fifth trip to Latin America as Vice President. The United States was the first country to recognize Guaido as the Interim President and has pledged $20 million in humanitarian aid. President Trump designated the Venezuelan state oil company under Executive Order 13850, blocking exports, imports, and financial dealings. Pence has previously met with Venezuelans who have fled their country to hear their stories. The Trump administration has also announced new sanctions targeting high-profile figures in the Maduro regime and security service. Last week, Guaido called upon volunteers to cross the border from Cucuta to Venezuela with humanitarian aid sent by the United States.
