President Barack Obama has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to certain terrorist attacks. This declaration, initially made on September 14, 2001, in Proclamation 7463, is being extended for another year due to the ongoing terrorist threat and the potential for further attacks on the United States. The powers and authorities granted to deal with this emergency will remain in effect beyond September 14, 2010. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
