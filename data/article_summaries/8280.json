Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Avril Haines recently visited Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with the aim of de-escalating tensions in the eastern region of the DRC. Haines was accompanied by Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Molly Phee and NSC Senior Director for African Affairs Judd Devermont. During the visit, Haines met with Rwandan President Kagame and Congolese President Tshisekedi, who both expressed their commitment to reducing tensions. The leaders plan to take specific steps to address security concerns and draw from previous agreements made under the Luanda and Nairobi processes. The US government supports these efforts and intends to monitor and support diplomatic and intelligence engagements between the two countries to promote security and prosperity for their people.
