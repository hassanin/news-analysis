During a press briefing, White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre discussed several topics. She highlighted the recent success in the fight to protect reproductive rights, with Americans in Kansas defeating a ballot measure that would have restricted access to healthcare and banned abortion. Jean-Pierre also mentioned that President Biden would sign an executive order at the first meeting of the interagency taskforce to further protect access to safe abortions and contraception. The order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with states, including through Medicaid, to ensure women have access to reproductive healthcare, regardless of their location. The President is also calling on domestic and international oil producers to increase output to lower gas prices. In addition, Jean-Pierre mentioned that former Treasury Secretaries from both Democratic and Republican administrations have endorsed the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to lower costs and address economic challenges. Finally, Jean-Pierre addressed questions about Speaker Pelosi's trip to Taiwan, the OPEC oil production increase, and the deletion of text messages related to the Capitol attack.
