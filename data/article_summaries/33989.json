President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum on August 21, 2019, regarding the discharge of federal student loan debt for totally and permanently disabled veterans. The memorandum highlights the sacrifices made by veterans and acknowledges the need to provide relief for their service-connected injuries. It states that the current process for veterans to apply for loan discharges has been overly complicated and difficult, preventing many from receiving the relief they are eligible for. Only half of the approximately 50,000 eligible veterans have taken advantage of the benefits provided by the Higher Education Act. The memorandum directs the Secretaries of Education and Veterans Affairs to develop a quick and efficient process to discharge the federal student loan debt of disabled veterans. It also encourages the sharing of disability determinations between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Education to streamline the administrative process. The memorandum defines federal student loan debt and discharge and includes general provisions to ensure compliance with applicable laws.
