The article discusses the launch of the Climate Data Initiative by the Obama Administration. The initiative aims to leverage the Federal Government's climate-relevant data resources to stimulate innovation and private-sector entrepreneurship in support of national climate-change preparedness. The initiative includes commitments from federal agencies and private-sector partners, such as the launch of climate.data.gov, a new climate-focused section of Data.gov that provides access to federal data about climate change. Other commitments include the development of tools and resources to help communities prepare for climate change impacts, such as maps of future sea-level rise and data on infrastructure and geographic features. Private-sector partners are also making commitments, such as providing map-based planning tools, hosting hackathons to develop climate resilience tools, and providing cloud computing resources for the creation of high-resolution maps and tools. The article highlights the importance of data and information in addressing climate change and the need for collaboration between government, private sector, and communities.
