The article discusses the implementation of the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, a model that aims to ensure the availability of ventilators in areas that may experience shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Government has been working to prevent healthcare utilization from exceeding the capacity of the healthcare system, and the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve is a voluntary initiative that allows ventilators to be deployed from areas with excess supply to areas in need. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) projects that the existing national ventilator supply is sufficient to handle national demand, even under aggressive virus spread scenarios. The CEA also finds that the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve is unlikely to require supplementation from the Federal Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). By reallocating excess supply rather than stockpiling, the goal of providing healthcare supplies to where they are needed can be achieved. Hospitals participating in the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve use an online platform to post their excess supply, and depending on projected demand, ventilators can be sent to hospitals experiencing shortages. The Dynamic Ventilator Reserve provides insurance against shortages and reduces the burden on the SNS. The article concludes by highlighting the potential of this model to ensure the availability of other critical supplies needed to combat COVID-19 through public-private partnerships.
