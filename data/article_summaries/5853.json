President Biden has announced that the United States has donated and shipped over 110 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 60 countries, making the US the global leader in vaccine donations. This surpasses the donations of all other countries combined and reflects the generosity of the American spirit. The US has been able to share these doses due to the aggressive action taken by the President to secure enough vaccines for all Americans. The majority of these vaccines were shipped through COVAX, with partnerships established with the African Union and the Caribbean Community. The US plans to continue its efforts to provide vaccines to the world, with the shipment of half a billion Pfizer doses to 100 low-income countries starting at the end of this month. The US aims to increase global vaccination coverage, prioritize healthcare workers and vulnerable populations, and help countries in need based on public health data. The goal is to save lives without using vaccines to secure favors from other countries. The US will work with partners to ensure equitable delivery based on science and public health data.
