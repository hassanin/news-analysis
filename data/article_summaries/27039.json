On January 3, 2018, the President signed three laws into effect. The first law, H.R. 4661, is the "United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017." This law authorizes funding for the U.S. Fire Administration under the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and reauthorizes three firefighter assistance grant programs. 

The second law, S. 1536, is the "Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicle Act." This law requires the Department of Transportation to designate an official to coordinate efforts in preventing human trafficking across the Department and with other Federal agencies. It also establishes an advisory committee on human trafficking and expands the activities authorized under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Outreach and Education Program to include human trafficking prevention. 

Lastly, S. 2273 extends the moratorium on the requirement for Clean Water Act permitting of incidental discharges from certain vessels from December 18, 2017, to January 19, 2018.
