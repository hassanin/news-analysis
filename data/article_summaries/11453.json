President Obama signed into law S. 246, the "Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff Commission on Native Children Act," which creates the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff Commission on Native Children. The Commission is responsible for conducting a comprehensive study of programs that serve Native children and making recommendations for improvements. The President commended the efforts of Congress, particularly Senator Heitkamp, in passing this law. However, the President noted that the Commission cannot be located in the executive branch due to separation of powers concerns, as it includes appointees from the legislative branch who have the power to direct executive branch agencies. Therefore, the Attorney General has been instructed to treat the Commission as an independent entity. The President expressed his anticipation for the Commission's work in ensuring the potential of all young people is realized.
