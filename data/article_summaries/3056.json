The Biden-Harris Administration has announced initial actions to address the maternal health crisis in the United States, especially among Black women and Native American women. The maternal mortality rates in the US are among the highest in the developed world, and recent data shows that Black women are two to three times more likely to die from pregnancy complications than non-Hispanic white women. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that two out of three of these deaths are preventable. The Administration is committed to reducing these high mortality and morbidity rates and tackling health disparities rooted in systemic racism. They have increased investment in reducing maternal mortality and morbidity, approved a Medicaid Section 1115 waiver in Illinois to extend postpartum coverage, and allocated $12 million in additional funds for maternal obstetrics care in rural communities. These actions aim to improve health equity and end race-based disparities nationwide.
