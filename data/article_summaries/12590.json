First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden have announced new private sector hiring and training commitments for veterans and military spouses as part of the 5th anniversary of Joining Forces. Since the launch of Joining Forces in 2011, more than 1.2 million veterans and military spouses have been hired or trained. The announcement includes over 110,000 new hiring commitments and nearly 60,000 new training commitments for veterans and military spouses over the next five years, primarily in the fields of aerospace, telecommunications, and tech. The companies making these commitments range from small startups to large manufacturers and include companies like Amazon, AT&T, and Verizon. In addition to hiring commitments, 15 companies and organizations have committed to leading training programs, sponsoring scholarships, and supporting certification courses for veterans and military spouses. Some of the companies participating in these training commitments include Salesforce, Microsoft, and Cisco. Overall, the goal is to provide more job opportunities and training for veterans and military spouses, ultimately reducing the unemployment rate among this group.
