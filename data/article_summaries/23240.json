President Obama will honor recipients of the 2012 Citizens Medal, the nation's second-highest civilian honor, at the White House on February 15, 2013. The Citizens Medal was established in 1969 to recognize American citizens who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or fellow citizens. The President called on the public to nominate individuals who have demonstrated commitment to service, made significant impacts on their communities, helped their country through extraordinary acts, worked on long-term or persistent problems, and had a sustained impact on others' lives. Nearly 6,000 nominations were submitted, and the President has selected 13 awardees. The recipients include individuals who have made significant contributions in pediatrics, veterans assistance, community service, healthcare, education, and more. The names of the six women who lost their lives in the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy are also included among the recipients.
