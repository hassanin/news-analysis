The White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, held a press briefing on October 5, 2015. He discussed a range of topics including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the hospital bombing in Afghanistan, gun control, and the possibility of Vice President Biden running for president. Earnest emphasized the benefits of the TPP, such as cutting import taxes on American goods and services and creating opportunities for American businesses and workers. He also expressed concern about the hospital bombing in Afghanistan and confirmed that there are three ongoing investigations into the incident. Earnest stated that the Obama administration is committed to closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and expects Congress to pass a responsible budget that funds national defense priorities. He also expressed disappointment in Congress' inaction on gun control and reiterated the President's commitment to use his bully pulpit to push for common-sense gun control measures. Earnest did not comment on whether the President would meet with Vice President Biden about his potential presidential run.
