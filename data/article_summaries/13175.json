President Obama will be meeting with the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness at the White House on January 17. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss initiatives and policies to strengthen the economy, promote job growth, and enhance America's competitiveness globally. The President will hear from a variety of leaders and continue the discussion on ways the government and business can work together to foster growth and create jobs. The Jobs Council was created to provide non-partisan advice to the President on strengthening the economy and ensuring the competitiveness of the United States. It is made up of representatives from various sectors of the economy who offer diverse perspectives on how the government can best foster growth, innovation, and job creation. The Council has previously held meetings in February, June, and September, focusing on promoting growth, hiring, worker training, and attracting businesses to the United States. Further details about the upcoming meeting will be announced later.
