The United States welcomes the announcement that the United Kingdom will host the 2014 NATO Summit. This will be the first time NATO leaders will meet collectively since the 2012 Chicago Summit. The summit will recognize the contributions of the International Security Assistance Force coalition and review the progress of Afghan forces in assuming security responsibility in Afghanistan. It will also focus on strengthening NATO and allied capabilities to address current security challenges and enhancing partnerships worldwide. The summit will review the implementation of the NATO Strategic Concept agreed upon during the 2010 Lisbon Summit and pursue further transformation to meet future challenges. The President looks forward to discussing security challenges with NATO allies and partners in the UK next year.
