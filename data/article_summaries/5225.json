President Biden's Investing in America agenda has announced over $220 billion in funding for infrastructure projects across 4,500 communities in the United States. The administration aims to rebuild roads and bridges, replace lead pipes, expand access to high-speed internet, and promote clean energy. The implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has led to the hiring of over 5,000 federal employees and the appointment of infrastructure coordinators in states and territories. The White House has created a website, build.gov, to provide information about the law, and the administration has provided technical assistance to communities. The president, vice president, cabinet members, and federal leaders have traveled extensively to discuss the opportunities created by this investment. The administration has also facilitated private sector investments in manufacturing and clean energy, resulting in job creation. Key infrastructure projects are now underway across the country.
