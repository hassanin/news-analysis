Secondly, he determines that provision of assistance to the governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Mauritania, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan would promote the purposes of the Act or is otherwise in the national interest of the United States.
