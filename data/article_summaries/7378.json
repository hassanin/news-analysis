implementing the Heat Emergency Action Team (HEAT), which will coordinate efforts across federal agencies to respond to extreme heat events and provide support to local communities. This includes enhancing early warning systems, improving heat-related illness surveillance, and conducting research on the health impacts of extreme heat. Additionally, the Biden-Harris administration is investing in infrastructure upgrades to mitigate the effects of extreme heat, such as improving cooling systems in schools and hospitals. They are also working to expand access to air conditioning for low-income households and vulnerable populations. Moreover, the administration is prioritizing equitable distribution of resources and funding to ensure that marginalized communities, which are disproportionately affected by extreme heat, receive adequate support and protection. By taking these actions, President Biden and Vice President Harris aim to reduce the health risks associated with extreme heat and promote resilience in the face of climate change.
