The White House has issued a message to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans will continue beyond June 26, 2014. This emergency was declared in 2001 due to the threat posed by extremist violence in the region, as well as acts obstructing the implementation of agreements in Bosnia and Kosovo. The President has determined that these actions still pose a threat to U.S. interests, national security, and foreign policy, and therefore the national emergency must continue.
