On the last day of Women's History Month, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein hosted a roundtable at the White House with young women who are leading their communities in improving mental health. The participants were joined by the leadership of national girls' advocacy organizations, all of which prioritize mental health policy and support young women leaders in addressing this issue. The roundtable discussion focused on the unique mental health challenges faced by women and girls, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The young women leaders shared their experiences and policy recommendations, including the need to meet girls where they are and reduce stigma and barriers to accessing mental health services. Senior White House officials reiterated the administration's commitment to addressing the mental health crisis, which includes increasing the size and diversity of the mental health workforce, expanding coverage and reducing costs for mental health services, and integrating mental health care across various settings. The President's FY23 budget proposes a historic $829 million to strengthen youth mental health. The officials also discussed the administration's efforts to address the mental health impacts of social media, particularly in relation to online harassment, abuse, and gender-based violence. The roundtable included young women leaders from various states and organizations, as well as leaders from national girls' advocacy organizations.
