The article discusses how Americans are facing rising gas prices due to Putin's military build-up around Ukraine, which has resulted in a decrease in oil supply. To address this issue, President Biden plans to announce a two-part plan. The first part involves immediately increasing the supply of oil by encouraging domestic production and releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The second part focuses on achieving lasting American energy independence by reducing dependence on oil and transitioning to clean energy. President Biden will call on Congress to pass his plan to speed up the transition to clean energy, create jobs, and save money for American families. Additionally, he will authorize the use of the Defense Production Act to secure American production of critical materials needed for clean energy. The article also mentions other recent efforts by the Biden administration to increase energy efficiency and lower costs for consumers.
