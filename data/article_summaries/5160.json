The article discusses the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Libya. The national emergency was initially declared in 2011 due to the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his government, who posed a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the extreme measures taken by Qadhafi, including the use of weapons, mercenaries, and violence against civilians. There was also a risk of misappropriation of Libyan state assets by Qadhafi and his associates. The prolonged attacks and the influx of refugees from Libya further deteriorated the country's security and stability. The article states that the situation in Libya still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and measures are necessary to prevent the diversion of assets and hindrance to Libyan national reconciliation. As a result, the national emergency declared in 2011 will continue beyond February 25, 2021, for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
