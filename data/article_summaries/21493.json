The White House launched the Declassification Policy Forum as an extension of the Open Government Initiative. The forum is an interactive conversation where the public can provide recommendations on revisions to the classification and declassification policies found in Executive Order 12958. The forum is divided into four topical areas: Declassification Policy, National Declassification Center, Classification Policy, and Technology Challenges and Opportunities. Each topic will be open for comments for three days, after which a concluding summary will be posted. The Public Interest Declassification Board will moderate the forum and accept input via email, fax, and US mail. The board's goal is to promote public access to a thorough and reliable record of significant US national security decisions and activities.
