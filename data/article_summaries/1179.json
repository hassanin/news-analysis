This article discusses an executive order issued by President Biden regarding the release of strategic and critical materials from the National Defense Stockpile. The purpose of the order is to strengthen the stockpile and ensure that both the government and the private sector have adequate quantities of supplies, equipment, or raw materials to mitigate potential shortages and import dependencies. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment is designated with the authority to release these materials when necessary for national defense purposes. The order emphasizes that releases should not be made for economic or budgetary purposes and that consultation with relevant departments and agencies is required before any release. The order also states that previously issued orders and regulations related to this matter will remain in effect unless inconsistent with this order. The general provisions clarify that the order does not impair existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits.
