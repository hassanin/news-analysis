This article is a memorandum of disapproval from the White House regarding S.J. Res. 24, a joint resolution that aims to nullify the Clean Power Plan, a set of national standards addressing greenhouse gas pollution from existing power plants. The memorandum states that climate change poses a significant threat to the future and future generations, and emphasizes the importance of reducing carbon pollution. It argues that the Clean Power Plan is a crucial step in this fight, as it is projected to reduce carbon pollution from power plants by 32 percent by 2030. The memorandum also highlights the public health and other benefits that would be lost if the Clean Power Plan is nullified, including reduced air pollution-related deaths and childhood asthma attacks. The memorandum concludes by stating that the President cannot support the resolution and is vetoing it.
