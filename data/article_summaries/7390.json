During a listening session convened by officials from the White House Gender Policy Council, Office of Public Engagement, and Office of the Vice President, advocates and leaders representing various organizations discussed the impact of abortion bans and restrictions on survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. The participants shared insights from service providers in states where abortion is now banned or severely limited following the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. They highlighted how these restrictions violate survivors' privacy and create additional safety concerns for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. The advocates also raised concerns about the disproportionate impact of these bans on historically marginalized or underserved communities.

While critical of abortion bans that have no exceptions for rape or incest, the advocates also emphasized that limited exceptions do not adequately meet the needs of survivors. They stressed that most victims of sexual violence do not report it, and survivors should not have to report in order to access reproductive health care options, including abortion. The advocates highlighted the importance of bodily autonomy and consent in preventing sexual violence, stating that taking away survivors' right to make decisions about their reproductive health compounds their trauma and has long-term implications. They also emphasized the need to protect the confidentiality and autonomy of all survivors to ensure their safety and well-being.

White House officials expressed gratitude to the leaders and advocates for their dedication to helping survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. They reiterated the President's commitment to supporting survivors in accessing services, safety, justice, and healing, as well as defending reproductive rights for all Americans.
