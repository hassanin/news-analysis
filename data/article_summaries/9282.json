The article discusses Vice President Kamala Harris's response to the failed vote on the Women's Health Protective Act. Harris expresses disappointment that the Senate did not defend a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. She emphasizes that a majority of Americans support this right and calls for the election of pro-choice leaders at all levels of government. Harris also criticizes extremist Republican leaders for their efforts to criminalize and punish women for their reproductive choices. Her message to women and childbearing people in America is to continue advocating for their rights and to support pro-choice candidates in future elections.
