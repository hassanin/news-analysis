President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at strengthening the American seafood industry, improving food security, and supporting American workers. The order emphasizes the need to reduce the country's dependence on imported seafood, which currently makes up over 85% of the seafood consumed in the US. It also addresses the issue of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which undermines sustainability and competes with law-abiding fishermen. The order calls for the removal of unnecessary regulatory barriers, improved transparency and efficiency in environmental reviews, and the development of aquaculture projects. It also establishes an Interagency Seafood Trade Task Force to promote fair and reciprocal trade in seafood products. The order further emphasizes the importance of safeguarding communities and maintaining a healthy aquatic environment.
