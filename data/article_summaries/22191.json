This article is a message from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, transmitting a proposed Agreement for Cooperation between the United States and South Korea concerning peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The proposed agreement meets all applicable statutory requirements and aims to advance nonproliferation and foreign policy interests. It allows for the transfer of material, equipment, information, and technology for nuclear research and power production, but does not permit the transfer of restricted data or sensitive nuclear technology. The agreement also establishes a High-Level Bilateral Commission to facilitate cooperation between the two countries. The proposed agreement will have an initial term of 20 years, with the possibility of renewal. The Republic of Korea has a strong track record on nonproliferation and is a member of various nonproliferation export control regimes. The President has approved the proposed agreement and urges Congress to consider it favorably. The transmission of the agreement initiates a review process by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
