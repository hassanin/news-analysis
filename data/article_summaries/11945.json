The article is a statement by the President honoring the life and service of Jack Gilligan. Gilligan served his fellow Americans, particularly in his home state of Ohio. He was a war veteran and received a Silver Star for his bravery during World War II. Gilligan continued to serve his country as a Congressman, where he played a role in passing significant legislation such as the Voting Rights Act, Medicare, and Medicaid. He later became the governor of Ohio. Gilligan was also the father of four children, including Kathleen Sebelius, who is the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Kathleen followed in her father's footsteps and they became the first father-daughter team of governors in American history. The President expresses his condolences to Kathleen, the entire Gilligan family, and their many friends.
