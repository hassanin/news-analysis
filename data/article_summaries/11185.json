The President commends the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for adopting the Declaration on Aviation Security, which aims to enhance aviation security and protect against evolving terrorist threats. Following the attempted terrorist attack on December 25th, the Department of Homeland Security has collaborated with ICAO, international partners, and representatives from the aviation industry to strengthen global aviation security. The ICAO General Assembly in Montreal saw the participation of nearly 190 countries, resulting in the establishment of a modern aviation security framework that will improve the safety and security of air travel.
