President Biden has transmitted five agreements related to the Compacts of Free Association to Congress. These agreements were signed by the Department of State with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). The Biden Administration is working with Congress to pass legislation that will allow for the implementation of these agreements. The Compacts of Free Association demonstrate the long-term commitment of the United States to these nations, fostering economic prosperity and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. The agreements include economic assistance for essential government services and contributions to Compact Trust Funds, which will support the countries' self-sufficiency in the future. The Biden Administration calls on Congress to pass Compacts-related legislation as soon as possible.
