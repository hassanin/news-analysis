In a speech delivered during Pride month in New York, Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized the importance of celebrating freedom, including the freedom to love and be oneself. She reflected on the progress made in securing LGBTQ+ rights, but also highlighted the current threats and challenges faced by the community. Hate crimes against LGBTQ+ people have surged, and extremists are pushing for discriminatory laws and policies. Harris called for unity and emphasized that when the rights of any American are attacked, it affects all Americans. She also recognized the role of leaders who have championed equality and empathy, including President Joe Biden. Harris urged continued efforts to protect and expand LGBTQ+ rights, pass the Equality Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and restore the protections of Roe v. Wade. She concluded by stating that fighting for the ideals of the country is a true form of patriotism.
