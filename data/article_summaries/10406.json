In this article, President Barack Obama sends a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor will continue beyond July 22, 2010. The actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others, including the depletion of Liberian resources and the removal and hiding of funds and property, are seen as undermining Liberia's transition to democracy and its development. These actions and policies are also considered a threat to the foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
