The author strongly supports the reauthorization of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a bipartisan law that has been crucial for U.S. trade with sub-Saharan Africa for over 20 years. They urge Congress to reauthorize AGOA promptly and update it to suit the economic opportunities of the next decade. AGOA has been instrumental in promoting private-sector-led economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa by enhancing the competitiveness of African products, expanding African exports, and generating thousands of new jobs. It also benefits U.S. businesses operating in the region by creating a more competitive environment. The author is dedicated to working with Congress and African partners to extend AGOA beyond 2025, aiming to strengthen trade relations, promote regional integration, and unlock Africa's significant economic potential for the benefit of both parties. They believe that when Africa succeeds, the whole world succeeds, as it represents the future.
