The White House has expressed deep concern over the detention of human rights lawyer Haitham Maleh by Syrian security services. The arrest of the 78-year-old Maleh is part of a broader crackdown on lawyers and civil society activists in Syria. The White House calls on the Syrian government to fulfill its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to stop making arbitrary arrests. They urge Syria to release Maleh and other citizens who have been imprisoned for exercising their political freedoms.
