President Donald J. Trump and his Administration are intensifying efforts to bring back all Americans who are unlawfully detained overseas. The United States strongly condemns both hostage takers and nations that continue to hold hostages and detain American citizens without any valid reason or fair legal process. Iran, in particular, has been using detentions and hostage taking as a state policy for almost forty years, and this practice persists with the recent sentencing of Xiyue Wang to ten years in prison. Iran has a responsibility to ensure the well-being and care of every US citizen in its custody. President Trump urges Iran to release Robert Levinson, who has been held captive for over a decade, and demands the release of Siamak and Baquer Namazi, who were taken during the Obama administration, as well as all other American citizens unjustly detained by Iran. President Trump is prepared to impose significant new consequences on Iran unless all American citizens who are unjustly imprisoned are released and returned home.
