President Trump has issued a proclamation maintaining entry restrictions on certain nationals from Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, and Somalia. Immigrant visas for certain nationals from Burma (Myanmar), Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, and Nigeria will also be suspended. Participation in the "Visa Lottery" will be suspended for certain nationals from Sudan and Tanzania. The new restrictions will not apply to tourist, business, or other nonimmigrant travel. The Administration will work with non-compliant countries to bring them into compliance with United States security standards. These measures aim to improve national security, raise global standards for information-sharing, and strengthen the integrity of the US immigration system. The Supreme Court has reviewed and upheld the legality of Proclamation 9645, which serves as the basis for these restrictions.
