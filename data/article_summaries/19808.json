On June 30, 2009, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation regarding duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The proclamation outlines various sections and provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the President to designate articles as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the GSP. It also discusses competitive need limitations for beneficiary developing countries, waivers of these limitations, and the determination of whether certain industries in the United States would be adversely affected. The proclamation includes modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to reflect changes in tariff treatment for certain articles imported by or on the account of returning United States residents, as well as technical corrections necessary for the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement and the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement. The modifications to the HTS set forth in the proclamation are effective on specific dates and supersede any inconsistent provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders.
