On January 1, 2021, the President signed into law the "Safeguarding Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation Act" or the "STORM Act." This act authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide capitalization grants to States. These grants will help establish revolving funds that will provide hazard mitigation assistance to reduce risks from disasters and natural hazards.
