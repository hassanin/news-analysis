President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New Jersey and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts after Hurricane Irene. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in five counties for grants, low-cost loans, and other programs to help with housing, repairs, and recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. William L. Vogel has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional counties may be designated for assistance as damage assessments continue. Residents and business owners can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
