President Biden addressed the recent Supreme Court decision on affirmative action in college admissions. He expressed his disagreement with the decision, stating that it effectively ends affirmative action. He clarified that affirmative action does not allow unqualified students to be admitted ahead of qualified ones, but rather colleges consider race as one of many factors after establishing a pool of qualified candidates. He emphasized the importance of diversity in colleges and the nation, and proposed a new standard where colleges take into account the adversity students have overcome when selecting among qualified applicants. He directed the Department of Education to analyze practices that build inclusive and diverse student bodies. He also called on companies to continue supporting diversity. President Biden acknowledged the disappointment caused by the Court's decision but emphasized the need to find a way forward and keep the promise of America alive.
