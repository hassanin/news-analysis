The White House is requesting $1 billion in the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget to support the development of Central America. The goal is to promote economic integration, democracy, and security in the region. The funding will be used to address issues such as lack of economic opportunities, weak institutions, and high levels of violence. Central American governments, along with international partners, have already taken steps to address these challenges. The funding will support three main areas: promoting prosperity and regional economic integration, enhancing security, and improving governance. Specific activities include promoting trade facilitation, energy development, poverty reduction, and workforce development. The funding will also support initiatives to improve community security, police reform, defense cooperation, and the fight against organized crime. Additionally, the funding will strengthen institutions, improve revenue collection, increase civil society participation, and target corruption. The United States has already been supporting similar initiatives in the region, including through the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
