In this statement, the President emphasizes the positive impact of the Affordable Care Act on the health security of Americans. He highlights several key benefits, including protection against insurance companies dropping or capping coverage, restrictions on premium increases, a tax credit for small businesses to provide coverage, the elimination of coverage denials for children with pre-existing conditions, the ability to add adult children to health plans up to age 26, access to preventive care without additional costs, and improved benefits and lower prescription drug costs for older Americans. The President also mentions that the Congressional Budget Office predicts that the law will reduce federal deficits by over a trillion dollars in the next two decades. He expresses a willingness to work with both Democrats and Republicans to improve the Affordable Care Act, but emphasizes that going backward is not an option and that Americans deserve the freedom and security of knowing they will have coverage when they need it, while also addressing the issue of rising healthcare costs.
