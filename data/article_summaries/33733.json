In a press conference, President Trump announced that Congressman Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey will be joining the Republican Party. Van Drew, who had been a Democrat, voted against impeachment and decided to switch parties. Trump expressed his excitement about the announcement and praised Van Drew for his decision. Van Drew explained that he made the switch because he felt that the Democratic Party was moving away from his moderate and conservative values. He expressed his support for Trump and his policies, including a strong economy and opposition to socialism. Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also welcomed Van Drew to the Republican Party. Trump dismissed the impeachment proceedings against him, calling them a "hoax" and a "setup." He expressed confidence in the upcoming Senate trial and his chances for reelection in 2020.
