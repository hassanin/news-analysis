President Donald J. Trump attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, making him the second sitting U.S. president to do so. His main message was that a prosperous America benefits the world and fair economic competition is essential for that prosperity. He also pitched investing in the American economy, stating that there has never been a better time to hire, build, invest, and grow in the United States. Trump used the opportunity to forge closer ties with U.S. allies and gain global support for American businesses. The American delegation was led by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and other members of Trump's Cabinet also attended.
