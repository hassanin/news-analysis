President Obama has declared a major disaster in Minnesota and has authorized federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following a severe winter storm that occurred in April 2013. The funding will be available for emergency work, as well as the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in several affected counties. In addition, federal funding will be provided for hazard mitigation measures throughout the state. Kari Suzann Cowie has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and further designations may be made if requested by the state and deemed necessary based on damage assessments.
