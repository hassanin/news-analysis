The article discusses President Obama's statement on the repeal of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy in 2010. The President commends the Senate for taking a historic step in ending a policy that undermined national security and went against the ideals that American servicemen and women risked their lives to defend. The repeal allows thousands of patriotic Americans, who were forced to leave the military simply because they were homosexual, to serve openly without discrimination. The President believes that this change will highlight the professionalism of the armed forces and their superior leadership and training. He thanks the leaders and individuals who worked hard to achieve this repeal and urges the Senate to send the measure to his desk for enactment. The President emphasizes that sexual orientation should not determine one's sacrifice, valor, or integrity, just as race, gender, religion, or creed should not.
