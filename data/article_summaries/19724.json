Vice President Joe Biden visited Serious Materials Chicago, a window factory that reopened due to increased demand for energy-saving building products as a result of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act investments in weatherization and energy programs. The factory had previously closed in December 2008, leaving over 260 union workers unemployed. Serious Materials acquired the assets of the factory and announced its intention to reopen and rehire the employees after the Recovery Act was signed into law. The company has already begun rehiring workers and installing new equipment for the manufacturing of super-insulating windows. The factory could eventually employ 2,000 people. The Recovery Act provides funding for state and local weatherization and energy efficiency efforts, as well as tax incentives for energy-saving building materials.
