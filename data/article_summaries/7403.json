Today, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan met with leaders of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to discuss partnerships, recruitment, and campus security in relation to national security. This was the first engagement of its kind with HBCU leaders by a national security advisor. The HBCU presidents expressed their desire to expand partnerships with federal agencies for research and curriculum development in areas such as data science, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, nano-technology, energy systems, and international affairs. They also discussed updating their curriculums in criminal justice and humanities programs to include security studies. The presidents also highlighted security challenges faced by their institutions, including recent bomb threats. Mr. Sullivan discussed existing government resources available to campuses for preparedness and resilience against physical and cyber-attacks. He also spoke about efforts to recruit talent from HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions and listened to feedback on expanding the talent pipeline for national security and foreign policy fields. The Biden-Harris Administration has committed nearly $6 billion in support to HBCUs through initiatives like the American Rescue Plan and debt forgiveness.
