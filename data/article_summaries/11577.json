Governor Doyle commends President Obama for making the decision to protect middle-class Americans from a tax increase. The compromise reached with Congressional Republicans includes extending the earned income tax credit, college tuition tax credit, and unemployment benefits. It also includes a 2-percent payroll cut for working people making less than $100,000 and support for small businesses.
