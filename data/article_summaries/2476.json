In a speech delivered at the Rose Garden, President Joe Biden addressed the issue of gun violence in the United States, calling it an epidemic and an international embarrassment. He emphasized that his proposed actions do not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights but are necessary to address the public health crisis. The President announced several immediate steps his administration will take, including measures to regulate "ghost guns" and pistols modified with stabilizing braces. He also called on Congress to pass three House bills that aim to close loopholes in background checks and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. President Biden stressed the need for bipartisan support and common ground to make progress in reducing gun violence. He also nominated David Chipman to serve as the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). The President concluded his speech by expressing his determination to keep the American people safe from gun violence and urged Congress to take action.
