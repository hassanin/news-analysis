Senior government officials from the United States and Mexico convened the U.S.-Mexico High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) in Mexico City to strengthen regional economic growth, integration, and partnership. The dialogue focuses on four central pillars: addressing climate change, promoting sustainable economic development in southern Mexico and Central America, securing future economic prosperity, and investing in people. The officials discussed collaboration on various areas, including climate change, electromobility, digital economy, workforce development, and supply chain resilience. They also emphasized the importance of improving the regional business climate, strengthening supply chains, and modernizing border infrastructure. The United States and Mexico aim to create inclusive opportunities for workers and communities, and they commit to meeting annually at the cabinet level to continue progress towards a secure and prosperous North America.
