President Joe Biden has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency regarding the threat of foreign interference in United States elections will continue beyond September 12, 2023. This national emergency was declared in Executive Order 13848 on September 12, 2018. While there is no evidence of a foreign power altering election outcomes or vote tabulation, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has increased vulnerabilities and magnified the intensity of the threat. The ability of foreign entities to interfere in elections, such as unauthorized accessing of election infrastructure or spreading propaganda and disinformation, still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security and foreign policy. Therefore, President Biden has determined it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
