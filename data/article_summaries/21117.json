This article is a statement by President Obama on his signing of H.R. 1540, the "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012." The President states that he signed the bill because it authorizes funding for defense, crucial services for service members and their families, and vital national security programs. However, he expresses reservations about certain provisions that regulate the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of suspected terrorists. The President believes that his administration has developed an effective framework for handling suspected terrorists and that restricting the options available to counterterrorism professionals would jeopardize national security. He clarifies that the bill does not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens, and he will interpret and implement the provisions in a manner that complies with the Constitution and applicable laws. The President also addresses other sections of the bill that interfere with executive branch processes and authority, and he vows to mitigate any concerns and seek the repeal of provisions that undermine his administration's policies and values.
