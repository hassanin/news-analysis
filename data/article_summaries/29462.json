On Child Health Day, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation recognizing the importance of children's health and well-being in America. The proclamation highlights the efforts of the administration in implementing federal programs and supporting state-level initiatives to improve access to healthcare services for low-income women, children, and families. It mentions the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant Program, the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, and the SUPPORT Act, which addresses healthcare services for infants suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome. The proclamation also mentions the administration's commitment to pediatric cancer research, with a $500 million investment over the next decade. President Trump acknowledges the challenges faced by young people, such as bullying and the opioid crisis, and emphasizes the importance of fostering a culture of respect and promoting childhood health and well-being. The proclamation calls upon citizens, organizations, and governments to prioritize the physical, spiritual, and emotional health of America's children. Child Health Day is observed on the first Monday in October, as designated by a joint resolution of the Congress in 1928.
