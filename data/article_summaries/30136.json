President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Lebanon, which was declared in Executive Order 13441 in 2007, will continue beyond August 1, 2019. The ongoing activities of Iran, such as arms transfers to Hizballah, are seen as undermining Lebanese sovereignty, contributing to instability in the region, and posing a threat to US national security and foreign policy. Therefore, President Trump has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to Lebanon.
