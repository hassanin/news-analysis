President Obama has cancelled his trip to Indonesia and Brunei due to the government shutdown. The decision was made because it would be difficult to proceed with foreign travel during the shutdown, and the President wants to continue urging Republicans to vote to reopen the government. Secretary Kerry will lead delegations to both countries instead. The cancellation of the trip is a consequence of the House Republicans' decision to force a shutdown, which is hindering job creation and the promotion of U.S. exports in the Asia-Pacific region. The President hopes to resume his work in the region at a later date.
