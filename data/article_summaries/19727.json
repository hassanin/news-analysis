The White House and the Department of Labor have launched a $100 million TechHire grant competition to expand opportunities for young Americans to get trained and placed into well-paying tech jobs. The competition will award grants to pilot and scale innovative partnerships between employers, labor organizations, community colleges, and other training providers to expand access to accelerated learning options, use data and innovative hiring practices, offer specialized training strategies, and connect people to jobs with hiring on-ramp programs. The Department of Labor is also launching the fourth round of its Training to Work grant competition, which will award grants to expand access to tech jobs and other high-growth occupations for adults returning from correctional facilities. Since the launch of the TechHire initiative in March 2015, 14 new communities have joined the initiative, including Baltimore, and have committed to finding new ways to recruit and place applicants based on their skills.
