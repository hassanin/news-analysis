The Gender Policy Council Co-Chairs, Jennifer Klein and Julissa Reynoso, along with other White House officials, hosted a roundtable with women's rights and reproductive health leaders to discuss the Supreme Court's ruling on Texas' SB8. The meeting focused on the impact of the ruling, particularly on communities of color and individuals with low incomes, and the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to ensuring access to safe and legal abortions. Women's rights leaders shared recommendations for the federal government to protect reproductive rights and highlighted connections to racial equity, gender-based violence, and the maternal health crisis. The White House officials expressed gratitude for the advocacy of the reproductive health and rights community and emphasized the administration's commitment to protecting and advancing reproductive health and rights. The President has tasked the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department to explore steps the federal government can take to ensure access to safe and legal abortion.
