On March 27, 2020, President Donald Trump issued executive orders related to national security and defense in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The orders invoke additional authority for the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to respond to the national emergency declared by Proclamation 9994. This includes the activation of certain units and individual members of the Ready Reserve under the jurisdiction of the Secretaries, not to exceed 1,000,000 members on active duty at any one time. The Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security are required to consult with relevant state officials regarding the utilization of National Guard Reserve Component units activated under this authority. The order also includes general provisions stating that it does not impair existing authority or functions of executive departments and agencies, and that it must be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It clarifies that the order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
