President Obama has announced the launch of two new manufacturing innovation hubs in the Detroit area and Chicago. These hubs will focus on lightweight and modern metals manufacturing, as well as digital manufacturing and design technologies. The President also announced a new competition for an advanced composites manufacturing innovation institute. These initiatives aim to boost advanced manufacturing, strengthen defense capabilities, and create high-quality jobs. The institutes will bring together companies, universities, and other institutions to co-invest in key technology areas and bridge the gap between applied research and product development. The long-term goal is to establish a national network of up to 45 manufacturing innovation institutes. The President will work with Congress to pass legislation to support these initiatives.
