President Donald J. Trump has issued an executive order to terminate Turkey's designation as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). This decision is based on Turkey's level of economic development. The President has also removed Turkey from the list of developing country World Trade Organization (WTO) members exempt from safeguard measures on certain products. As a result of this termination, relevant provisions of previous proclamations and executive orders are superseded. The exemption for Turkey from safeguard measures on certain products is also removed. These actions will take effect on May 17, 2019.
