On December 15, 2021, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the threat posed by global illicit drug trafficking. The trafficking of drugs like fentanyl and other synthetic opioids into the United States has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans annually, as well as numerous non-fatal overdoses. Drug cartels, transnational criminal organizations, and their facilitators are the primary sources of these illicit drugs, which fuel the opioid epidemic and drug-related violence. The national emergency, declared in Executive Order 14059, is set to continue beyond December 15, 2023, as it still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. This extension is in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
