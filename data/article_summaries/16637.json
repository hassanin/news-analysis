President Obama announced nearly $600 million in grants through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to support construction and renovation projects in 85 community health centers across the country. The grants will also help these centers implement electronic health records and other health information technology systems. The funds are expected to create new job opportunities in construction and healthcare and provide healthcare services to over half a million additional patients in underserved communities. Additionally, the President announced a new demonstration program to support advanced primary care services for Medicare beneficiaries through community health centers. These programs aim to save money, generate jobs, and ensure access to healthcare for more people. The grants are part of a series of funding initiatives to support community health centers that provide preventive and primary care services in over 7,500 locations nationwide.
