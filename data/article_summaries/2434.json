Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Nokia and Sanmina Corporation in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin to highlight the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to invest in high-speed internet, boost domestic manufacturing, and create jobs. Nokia will be manufacturing broadband network electronics products for the BEAD program in the US, adding up to 200 new jobs. This makes Nokia the first telecom company to announce the manufacturing of broadband electronics products in the United States. The visit coincides with the announcement, and Vice President Harris will be joined by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Senator Tammy Baldwin. The Biden-Harris Administration's investments in high-speed internet and made-in-America policies have spurred domestic manufacturing announcements, including in the broadband industry. The administration aims to connect every American to affordable, reliable high-speed internet by the end of the decade through their Internet For All initiative, which is investing $90 billion. The Buy America provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are driving the onshoring of manufacturing, and funds from the BEAD program will be used to purchase items manufactured in the US. President Biden's Investing in America Agenda, which includes various investments, is unleashing a manufacturing boom and creating jobs across the country. The private sector has already invested over $500 billion in new manufacturing in America.
