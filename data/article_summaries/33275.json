President Trump commends the Senate for passing the FY 2018 Budget Resolution, which aligns with the administration's goals of promoting economic growth and job creation. The resolution aims to achieve these goals through tax reform and cuts, simplifying the tax code, providing financial relief for families, and enhancing the competitiveness of American businesses globally. President Trump anticipates the final enactment of the budget resolution, which he believes will help bring jobs back to the United States.
