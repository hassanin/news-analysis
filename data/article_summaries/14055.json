The United States strongly condemns the conviction of three Al-Jazeera journalists and 15 other defendants in Egypt. The prosecution of journalists for reporting information that does not align with the government's narrative goes against media freedom and democratic progress. The verdict is part of a pattern of prosecutions and verdicts that violate human rights and democratic governance. The victims in these cases are not just the defendants and journalism, but also the Egyptian people who are demanding their fundamental freedoms. The United States calls on the Egyptian government to pardon or reduce the sentences of these individuals and grant clemency for all politically motivated sentences. They also urge President al-Sisi to provide protections for free expression and assembly as well as fair trial safeguards required by Egypt's international obligations. The United States will continue to support the Egyptian people in their struggle for rights.
