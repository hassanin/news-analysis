During a press briefing aboard Air Force One, Mr. Miller discussed the administration's focus on addressing the issue of MS-13, a violent gang. He emphasized the need for more resources, including additional ICE officers, expedited removal for illegal migrants, reduction of court backlogs, and the construction of a border wall. Mr. Miller also stated that the administration is committed to finding and removing gang members, regardless of their criminal record. When asked about the impact of the administration's approach on smuggling and trafficking, Mr. Miller argued that a tougher stance on illegal immigration would shut down smugglers and ultimately be more humanitarian. He also mentioned that the decision on DACA is being addressed by Secretary Kelly and the Justice Department. Regarding funding for the border wall and new ICE agents, Mr. Miller warned that Senate Democrats who oppose such funding will face backlash from the American people.
