This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the national emergency with respect to terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process will continue. The national emergency was initially declared on January 23, 1995, and has been modified and clarified by subsequent executive orders. The President has determined that these terrorist activities still pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, and therefore, the national emergency and the measures taken to address it will remain in effect beyond January 23, 2014. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
