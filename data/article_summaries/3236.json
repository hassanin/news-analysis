President Biden has declared a major disaster in Connecticut and authorized federal assistance to support recovery efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane Ida. This includes grants for temporary housing, home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other programs to aid individuals and business owners. Federal funding for hazard mitigation measures is also available on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Robert V. Fogel has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, and additional designations may be made in the future. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance online or by phone. For further information, media can contact the FEMA news desk.
