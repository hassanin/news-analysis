On February 25, 2011, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates in Libya. This emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat to national security and foreign policy posed by Qadhafi's use of violence, weapons, and mercenaries against the Libyan people. The declaration also aimed to prevent the misappropriation of Libyan state assets by Qadhafi, his government, family members, or associates. The current situation in Libya still poses a threat to the United States, particularly regarding the potential diversion of assets or hindrance to Libyan national reconciliation. As a result, President Trump has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This decision will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
