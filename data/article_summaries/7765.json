Vice President Kamala Harris is set to announce an action plan that aims to accelerate the replacement of all lead pipes in the next decade. The plan, called the Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan, is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to ensure clean drinking water and healthy homes for all Americans. Lead in drinking water pipes, faucets, paint, and walls poses a significant health risk to families and children, and low-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately affected. The plan includes over 15 new actions from more than 10 federal agencies, leveraging resources from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other funding sources. The actions include allocating $2.9 billion in funding for lead service line replacement, issuing national program guidance to states on water infrastructure funding, clarifying the use of funds for lead pipe replacement under the American Rescue Plan, establishing regional technical assistance hubs, awarding grants to protect children and families from lead paint, leveraging existing USDA funding, and directing federal agencies to prioritize lead remediation. The plan also includes updates to rules and enforcement, such as the development of a proposed National Primary Drinking Water Regulation for lead and copper rule improvements, and actions to reduce exposure in disadvantaged communities, schools, daycare centers, and public housing. The plan also highlights the commitment to track and make publicly available lead pipe and paint investments in disadvantaged communities. Additionally, the plan calls for the establishment of a Cabinet Level Partnership for Lead Remediation in Schools and Childcare Centers to address lead contamination in educational facilities. Overall, the plan represents a comprehensive effort to address lead exposure and protect the health and well-being of all Americans.
