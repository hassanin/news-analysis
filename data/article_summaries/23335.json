President Obama will be traveling to Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina on June 13th to meet with the Jobs and Competitiveness Council. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss initiatives and policies that will strengthen the economy, promote job growth, and enhance America's competitiveness worldwide. The President will engage with various leaders and continue the discussion on practical ways that the government and businesses can collaborate to foster growth and create jobs. Additionally, the Council will emphasize the importance of educating and training the American workforce to ensure that future jobs and industries are created within the United States. The Jobs and Competitiveness Council, led by GE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt, was established to provide non-partisan advice to the President on strengthening the economy and ensuring the country's competitiveness. The council is comprised of representatives from different sectors of the economy who offer diverse perspectives on how the federal government can promote growth, competitiveness, innovation, and job creation. This will be the President's second meeting with the Jobs Council, following their initial meeting at the White House on February 24th, where they focused on finding new ways to encourage hiring, promote growth, educate and train workers, and attract businesses and jobs to the US. More details about the trip will be provided in the future.
