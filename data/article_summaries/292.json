The Biden-Harris Administration has announced historic investments in communities across the country, focusing on growing the economy from the middle-out and bottom-up. This week, multiple manufacturing companies, LG Energy and QCELLS, announced expansions of their facilities in Arizona and Georgia, creating hundreds of good-paying jobs. Vice President Kamala Harris announced $197 million to support wildfire resilience in 22 states. The Department of Transportation also announced investments in transportation infrastructure and safety programs across 33 states. Additionally, President Biden will be embarking on a three-week Investing in America tour to highlight the benefits of his economic policies. Local coverage highlights the impact of these investments, such as LG Energy Solution's plan to spend $5.5 billion on a battery manufacturing plant in Arizona and the creation of thousands of jobs. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed by Congress last year, is credited with increasing demand for batteries. The IRA also provides tax credits for building solar manufacturing facilities and clean energy incentives, which have spurred clean energy manufacturing announcements in Georgia. President Biden will be visiting North Carolina to visit Wolfspeed, a semiconductor producer, which recently announced a $5 billion investment and the creation of 1,800 jobs. The Department of Transportation is awarding grants to improve traffic management systems and drone programs in several states. Vice President Kamala Harris detailed $197 million in federal grants to help communities prepare for wildfires, with funding coming from the bipartisan infrastructure law. This is the first round of a new $1 billion Community Wildfire Defense Grant program. The investments and grants aim to create economic opportunity and protect communities across the country.
