National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer, and Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall hosted an event to honor veterans, volunteers, and Afghan newcomers for their contributions to Operation Allies Welcome (OAW). OAW is a program through which the U.S. government welcomed tens of thousands of Afghan allies to America. The event was attended by Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough, Deputy Secretary Defense Kathleen Hicks, Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Andrea Palm, and Acting Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources John Bass. The Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to resettling Afghan allies over the coming years was reaffirmed, and a program called Enduring Welcome will support this ongoing effort. Secretary McDonough emphasized the strength of U.S. veterans and servicemembers, who are now welcoming their Afghan partners. Secretary Mayorkas highlighted the whole-of-government effort, led by DHS, to welcome approximately 100,000 Afghan newcomers and the importance of partnerships in helping them rebuild their lives in their new communities.
