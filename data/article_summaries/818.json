President Biden has announced the release of the Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5), which assesses the impacts of climate change in the United States. The assessment shows that every region in the country is already experiencing the effects of climate change, and ambitious climate action is underway in every region. The report also highlights that climate-related extreme weather events are becoming more severe and costly, with an estimated annual cost of at least $150 billion. To address these challenges, President Biden is announcing over $6 billion in investments to make communities more resilient to climate change impacts. The investments will focus on strengthening the electric grid, reducing flood risk, supporting conservation efforts, and advancing environmental justice. The NCA5 also includes a chapter on Economics, which highlights the economic impacts and opportunities associated with climate action, and a chapter on Social Systems and Justice, which examines how different communities are disproportionately affected by climate change. The report emphasizes the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to clean energy, and highlights the need for a just transition that addresses existing social and economic inequities.
