ConnectHome is a new initiative announced by President Obama to expand high-speed broadband to more families across the country. The pilot program will launch in 27 cities and one tribal nation, initially reaching over 275,000 low-income households and nearly 200,000 children. Internet service providers, non-profits, and the private sector will offer broadband access, technical training, digital literacy programs, and devices for residents in assisted housing units. ConnectHome aims to bridge the "homework gap" and ensure that low-income students have access to high-speed internet at home. The initiative will also provide affordable connectivity through partnerships with Internet service providers. Additionally, ConnectHome will offer skills training and digital literacy programs for residents in assisted housing units. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will support the initiative by requiring new residential construction and rehabilitation projects to support broadband internet connectivity, providing funding for local broadband initiatives, and integrating digital literacy programming into related initiatives. ConnectHome will launch in communities that are designated Promise Zones, where the Administration works with local leaders in high-poverty communities to achieve educational and economic goals.
