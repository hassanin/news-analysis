President Biden and the United States government consider 5G security to be a top priority and advocate for a thriving digital economy worldwide. They believe that 5G is the future of the Internet and will have a significant impact on various aspects of our lives. To ensure national security, personal privacy, and human rights, it is crucial for countries and citizens to trust that 5G equipment and software are secure. The United States believes that addressing 5G security effectively requires a global approach and is committed to engaging with allies and partners to promote open, interoperable, secure, and reliable information and communications technology infrastructure supported by diverse and trustworthy suppliers. The United States participated in the Prague 5G Security Conference and supports the Czech Republic's "Prague Proposals on Telecommunications Supplier Diversity," which emphasize the role of governments in fostering secure and resilient telecommunications. The United States also appreciates the Czech Republic's efforts in addressing security challenges posed by Emerging and Disruptive Technologies and the release of the "Prague Proposals 2.0 on Cyber Security of Emerging and Disruptive Technologies." The United States applauds the Czech Republic's successful side event on telecoms supplier diversity, which highlighted the importance of the issue and the need for shared international principles.
