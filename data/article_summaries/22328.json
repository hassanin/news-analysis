The White House has launched the "More Firm, Stronger" Awareness Campaign to encourage eligible immigrants to become citizens. The campaign aims to break down barriers and promote the rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of citizenship. There are approximately 13.3 million eligible residents living in the US, with 8.8 million eligible to apply for citizenship. The campaign includes partnerships with nonprofit organizations, businesses, and community leaders to provide assistance and resources for those seeking naturalization. Additionally, USCIS has announced improvements to customer service, the expansion of multilingual materials, and grants to support citizenship and immigrant integration. Private sector partners have also committed to supporting the campaign, including investment in resources and services to assist eligible immigrants.
