Vice President Kamala Harris is announcing a series of new U.S. initiatives to advance the safe and responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These initiatives demonstrate U.S. leadership on AI and build upon an Executive Order signed by President Biden. The Biden-Harris Administration is working with the private sector, other governments, and civil society to ensure that AI innovation does not compromise public rights and safety. The Vice President is also committed to establishing international rules and norms for AI that reflect democratic values and interests. Her trip to the United Kingdom and participation in the Global Summit on AI Safety will further this work. This visit builds on her previous efforts to address the challenges and opportunities of advanced technology, including convening AI companies and consumer protection leaders.
