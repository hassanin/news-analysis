On June 6, 1944, also known as D-Day, American and Allied troops launched an assault on the beaches of Normandy, France, in an effort to reclaim control of Europe from Nazi Germany. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, issued a message to the troops, emphasizing the importance of their mission and the support they had from people around the world. The operation involved paratroopers landing behind enemy lines and infantry divisions storming the beaches. The soldiers faced numerous obstacles and heavy casualties, but their determination and bravery allowed them to secure a beachhead and begin liberating Europe. This historic event marked the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. 75 years later, we remember and honor the sacrifices made by the soldiers who fought on D-Day. To commemorate the 75th anniversary, President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed June 6, 2019, as a National Day of Remembrance. Americans are encouraged to participate in programs and activities that honor the memory of those who fought and died for freedom.
