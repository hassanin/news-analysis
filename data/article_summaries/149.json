The Biden administration is taking new actions to lower healthcare costs for Americans, including measures to reduce prescription drug prices. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Biden, makes recommended vaccines free for Medicare beneficiaries and will enable Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. The act also requires drug companies to pay rebates to Medicare if they raise their prices faster than inflation. Additionally, the act includes provisions to lower the cost of insulin, with the aim of making it more affordable for Americans. The administration is releasing data showing the savings that seniors would have experienced in 2021 if the Inflation Reduction Act had been in effect. The report estimates that 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries would have saved nearly $70 per person on recommended vaccines. The Biden administration is committed to lowering healthcare costs and expanding benefits for all Americans. However, congressional Republicans have introduced legislation to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which would result in higher health insurance premiums, higher drug prices, and limited access to vaccines for seniors.
