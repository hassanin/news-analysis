In a United Nations Security Council meeting, the United States presented the full extent of Russia's threat to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They emphasized the implications of this threat for both Ukraine and the fundamental principles of the UN Charter and the international order. The US stated that if Russia is genuinely interested in addressing security concerns through dialogue, they and their allies will engage in good faith. However, if Russia chooses to disregard diplomacy and attack Ukraine, they will be held responsible and face severe consequences. The US and its allies are preparing for all scenarios. The international community must be aware of Russia's threatening actions and be ready to respond to the risks they pose. This Security Council meeting is a crucial step in uniting the world to reject the use of force, call for de-escalation, support diplomacy, and demand accountability from every member state to refrain from military aggression against its neighbors.
