This notice announces that the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, which was declared by President Obama in 1995, will continue for another year. The declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act due to the threat these traffickers pose to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The extreme level of violence, corruption, and harm caused by these traffickers in the United States and abroad further justifies the continuation of the national emergency. The notice states that the measures adopted to address this emergency will also remain in effect.
