On January 18, 2021, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation regarding immigration and COVID-19 restrictions. The proclamation states that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has ordered that starting from January 26, 2021, all air passengers arriving in the United States from foreign countries must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test or documentation of recovery from COVID-19. The order specifically applies to passengers from the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the Federative Republic of Brazil, as these jurisdictions have been identified as potential sources of COVID-19 spread. The Secretary of Health and Human Services expects cooperation from these jurisdictions in implementing the testing order. The proclamation highlights the contrast in behavior between these jurisdictions and the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Iran, which have failed to cooperate with the United States in combatting the pandemic. Based on the Secretary's advice, President Trump has decided to remove the restrictions on the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the Federative Republic of Brazil, while keeping the restrictions in place for China and Iran. The proclamation terminates previous proclamations related to the suspension of entry into the United States for individuals from these jurisdictions. It also clarifies that the proclamation does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, nor does it create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States.
