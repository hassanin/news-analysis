On April 8, 2022, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signed two acts and two executive orders related to trade relations with Russia and Belarus. The first act, called the Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act, suspended nondiscriminatory tariff treatment for products of Russia and Belarus and imposed specific rates of duty on all their products. The second act, called the Ending Importation of Russian Oil Act, prohibited imports of Russian oil products. The executive orders issued by President Biden prohibited the importation of various products of Russian origin, including crude oil, petroleum, liquefied natural gas, coal, fish, seafood, alcoholic beverages, and non-industrial diamonds. President Biden has now determined that increasing the rates of duty on certain other Russian products, which have not already been prohibited, to 35 percent ad valorem, is warranted and consistent with the foreign policy interests of the United States. The proclamation includes specific details on the products and the effective date of the increased duties. It also amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to include Russia and Belarus in the list of countries subject to column 2 duties. This proclamation supersedes any previous proclamations and executive orders that are inconsistent with its actions.
