With just days left before the end of the fiscal year, extreme House Republicans are risking a government shutdown that would have damaging impacts across the country. This includes delaying long-term disaster recovery and undermining preparedness in communities. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is already dwindling, and an extreme Republican shutdown would leave it underfunded. This would delay nearly 2,000 long-term recovery projects, such as rebuilding a school in Tennessee and a senior citizen building in New Jersey. Additionally, it would undermine communities' preparedness by preventing fire departments from accessing necessary funding and halting first responder training. The reason for this risk is the extreme House Republicans' efforts to slash funding for vital programs instead of working in a bipartisan manner. They have turned their backs on a bipartisan budget deal and proposed devastating cuts to programs, including FEMA.
