This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations. The national emergency was initially declared on July 24, 2011, through Executive Order 13581. The declaration was made to address the threat posed by significant transnational criminal organizations to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. These organizations have reached a level of scope and gravity that threatens international political and economic systems. They have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous, infiltrating foreign governments and the international financial system, which weakens democratic institutions, undermines economic markets, and facilitates violent conflicts. Due to the ongoing threat, the national emergency declared in 2011 and the measures adopted at that time must continue beyond July 24, 2015. Therefore, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations is being extended for one year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
