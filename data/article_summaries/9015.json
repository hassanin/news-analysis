President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed July 16, 2023, as National Atomic Veterans Day in honor of the members of the Armed Forces who participated in nuclear tests or were exposed to radioactive material from 1945 to 1962. These Atomic Veterans faced significant risks and were sworn to secrecy, often unable to receive care for the health conditions they developed. Many suffered from untreated cancers caused by radiation exposure. Although a 1996 repeal allowed them to finally tell their stories and receive benefits, many had already passed away without their families knowing the full extent of their service. The Department of Veterans Affairs now offers benefits to Atomic Veterans, but many remain unaware of this. President Biden emphasizes the sacred obligation to care for those who serve and their families, including Atomic Veterans. Laws have been signed to support veterans who developed cancer and other medical conditions stemming from the World War II nuclear program. The PACT Act has been one of the most significant laws in this regard. The President calls upon all Americans to observe National Atomic Veterans Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor their brave service and sacrifice in defending the nation. The proclamation highlights the importance of building a future of peace and a world free from the threat of nuclear weapons.
