The Trump administration is calling for reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to ensure its long-term viability. The program, which is up for reauthorization, is unable to handle catastrophic losses like those caused by the hurricanes in 2017. The administration proposed several reforms in October 2017 to put the program on a sound financial footing while maintaining affordable rates for low-income policyholders. They also supported legislation that would develop the private market for flood insurance. The administration is urging Congress to consider these reforms as they debate the future of the NFIP.
