National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi recently held a meeting at the White House with sustainability executives and business leaders to discuss the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on their companies. The executives expressed concerns about the potential repeal of the tax credits provided by the act, including clean energy incentives, as it would pose economic risks and negatively affect the employment of hundreds of thousands of Americans. Zaidi highlighted how the Inflation Reduction Act and the tax credits are contributing to the growth of the economy and enhancing competitiveness. The executives also expressed their commitment to bipartisan collaboration in order to expand their businesses and promote the development of a clean energy economy in the United States. Notable companies in attendance included Hannon Armstrong, Holcim, HP, National Grid, Outdoor Industry Association, Siemens, Vail Resorts, Bonterra Organic Estates, PepsiCo, and Stonyfield.
