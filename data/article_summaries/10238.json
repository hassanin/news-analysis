Deputy National Security Advisor Benjamin Rhodes and National Security Advisor to the Vice President Jake Sullivan met with a former Syrian military police photographer known as "Caesar." Caesar defected from the Assad regime and brought with him thousands of photographs showing evidence of torture and killing on a large scale by the regime. Rhodes and Sullivan commended Caesar for his bravery in revealing the atrocities committed by the Assad regime. They expressed concern that the perpetrators cannot be held accountable in the International Criminal Court due to vetoes from Russia and China. However, the United States will continue to work with international partners to pursue justice. The United States also expressed deep concern for the thousands of Syrians who are still imprisoned and pledged to provide humanitarian aid and support to the moderate Syrian opposition. They also reiterated their commitment to achieving a political resolution that leads to Assad's departure and brings an end to the Syrian conflict.
