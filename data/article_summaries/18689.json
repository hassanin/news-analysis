In a statement released on May 15, 2009, President Barack Obama discussed his views on military commissions and the need for reform. He acknowledged that military commissions have a long history in the United States and can be appropriate for trying enemies who violate the laws of war, but stressed the importance of proper structure and administration. Obama expressed his objection to the Military Commissions Act passed by the Bush Administration, as it failed to establish a legitimate legal framework and hindered the swift and certain justice for detainees. He highlighted that the system at Guantanamo Bay had only successfully prosecuted three suspected terrorists in over seven years. The Department of Defense would be seeking additional continuances in ongoing military commission proceedings in order to reform the process. The Secretary of Defense would inform Congress of rule changes, including the exclusion of statements obtained through cruel interrogation methods, limitations on hearsay, greater latitude in selecting counsel for the accused, protections for those who refuse to testify, and the ability for military commission judges to establish their own jurisdiction. These reforms aimed to restore the legitimacy of the commissions and align them with the rule of law. Obama also expressed the intention to work with Congress on further reforms that would allow commissions to effectively prosecute terrorists while also utilizing federal prosecutions in Article III courts. This approach was seen as the best way to protect the country while upholding its values.
