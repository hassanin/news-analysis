The article discusses the continuation of a national emergency in the United States. According to the National Emergencies Act, a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice stating that it will continue. In this case, President Obama has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the emergency declared after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, will continue for another year. The President believes that the terrorist threat that led to the declaration of the national emergency still exists, and therefore it is necessary to continue the emergency beyond September 14, 2014.
