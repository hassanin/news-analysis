Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and Co-Chair of the Gender Policy Council Julissa Reynoso held a roundtable at the White House with transgender women of color advocates. The event was part of a series of listening sessions organized by the White House-led Interagency Working Group on Safety, Inclusion, and Opportunity for Transgender Individuals. The participants discussed the high levels of violence and harassment faced by transgender women and girls of color, highlighting discrimination, homelessness, intimate partner violence, poverty, unemployment, immigration, and other systemic barriers as contributing factors. They provided policy recommendations to address economic justice, opportunity, health equity, and safety for transgender individuals. Ambassador Rice and Co-Chair Reynoso expressed their appreciation for the advocacy and policy suggestions and reaffirmed the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to advancing justice, opportunity, and safety for transgender women of color and the LGBTQ+ community as a whole. They emphasized an intersectional approach to gender equity and racial justice and the role of the Domestic Policy Council and Gender Policy Council in leading the Interagency Working Group.
