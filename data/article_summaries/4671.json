The briefing discusses the progress made in fighting the current monkeypox outbreak. The number of cases is decreasing, and there is promising real-world data on the effectiveness of vaccines. Over 800,000 shots have been administered so far. The focus is on reaching high-risk communities, especially Black and brown communities. Pride events have been successful in vaccinating people. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will release federally funded monkeypox research to improve research transparency. The briefing also provides preliminary data on the effectiveness of the JYNNEOS vaccine in preventing monkeypox infections. Those who received the vaccine were about 14 times less likely to become infected compared to those who did not receive the vaccine. It is recommended that individuals receive two doses of the vaccine for durable immune protection. The eligibility for vaccination is being expanded to include pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for high-risk individuals. The briefing also addresses stigma as a barrier to vaccination and provides options for vaccine administration sites to reduce stigma. Mental health resources are available for those experiencing stress and anxiety related to monkeypox. The briefing emphasizes the importance of equity in the response and the need to continue efforts to control the outbreak. Funding resources are being mobilized to support the response, including Ryan White resources, HIV and STD grants, and mental health services. The briefing concludes by highlighting the importance of addressing rising rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and the opportunity to integrate monkeypox response with efforts to tackle STDs.
