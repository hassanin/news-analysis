This article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney aboard Air Force One en route to Elyria, Ohio. Carney discusses President Obama's upcoming event in Lorain County, Ohio, where he will highlight job training initiatives to help unemployed Americans find jobs in high-demand industries. The President will meet with a group of unemployed workers who have benefited from federal funding and have been successful in finding jobs after graduating from Lorain County Community College's worker training programs. Carney also mentions that the Ryan/Republican budget would cut job training programs and other programs essential for economic growth. The press secretary answers questions on various topics, including the President's response to Warren Buffett's stage one cancer, soldiers posing with dead bodies in Afghanistan, and recent issues with the GSA and Secret Service. Carney states that these issues do not detract from the President's focus on the economy, and the President remains committed to making investments for economic growth and taking a balanced approach to deficit reduction. He also comments on North Korea's actions, Syria's violence, and the Republican Party's disconnect with public opinion.
