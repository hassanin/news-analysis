The United States has published its National Action Plan on Preventing the Misuse of Companies and Legal Arrangements, as part of the G-8 summit. The plan aims to combat the criminal misuse of businesses, shell companies, and front companies that facilitate financial crime and tax evasion. The plan includes measures to assist law enforcement and tax authorities in identifying beneficial owners of legal entities, enhance financial transparency, and strengthen customer due diligence requirements for financial institutions. The US also advocates for comprehensive legislation to require the disclosure of beneficial ownership information and will work towards enhancing international cooperation to increase transparency in the international financial system.
