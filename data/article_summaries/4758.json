President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued an executive order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024. The order blocks and prohibits the transfer, payment, export, withdrawal, or any other dealings with the property and interests in property of foreign persons identified by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. Sanctions under this order do not apply to foreign persons who have been granted a waiver. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security are instructed to implement certain provisions of the Protecting Europe's Energy Security Act of 2019 as it applies to visas, admission, and parole. The order also prohibits making contributions or providing funds, goods, or services to or from any person whose property and interests in property are blocked. Any transaction or conspiracy that evades or violates the prohibitions set forth in the order is prohibited. The order prohibits donations of specified articles by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked. The order defines terms such as "entity," "foreign person," "person," and "United States person." Notice of measures taken pursuant to this order is not required for those persons who might have a constitutional presence in the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions and employ powers granted by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Protecting Europe's Energy Security Act. The order does not prohibit transactions for the conduct of official business of the Federal Government or the United Nations. It also does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The order is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations, and it does not create any enforceable right or benefit against the United States or any other person.
