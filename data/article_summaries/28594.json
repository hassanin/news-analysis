The pace of hiring in the US in 2018 was unexpectedly robust, and the reason is that more people have decided to look for work than experts had anticipated. This influx of job seekers has helped reverse the trend of Americans leaving the job market after the recession. The growth in the workforce, made up of people either working or looking for work, has the potential to extend the current economic expansion. Businesses are now recruiting more widely and relaxing their education or experience requirements to attract more applicants. Some companies are also considering applicants with disabilities or criminal backgrounds. The number of people either employed or looking for work grew 1.6% in 2018, higher than the average annual gain in the first five years after the recession. As a result, the proportion of prime-age women and prime-age African-American women in the labor force has surpassed pre-recession levels. Some companies are investing in training programs and adjusting their requirements to attract talent.
