President Obama hosted the 2015 White House Science Fair to celebrate the winners of various science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competitions. He announced over $240 million in new private sector commitments to inspire and prepare more girls and boys, especially those who are under-represented, to excel in STEM fields. The President's "Educate to Innovate" campaign has resulted in over $1 billion in financial and in-kind support for STEM programs. The fair showcased various projects from students across the country, including a computer program to tackle cyber-bullying, a spinal implant to help children with scoliosis, a solar-heating system for communities without electricity, and a wearable monitor for people with Alzheimer's.
