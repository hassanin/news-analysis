The United States is committed to ending the COVID-19 pandemic globally and recognizes the importance of vaccinating people worldwide. They have committed $4 billion to support COVAX and have launched partnerships to increase global vaccine production. The administration supports temporarily waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines to ensure equitable access. The US will share 80 million doses of vaccines by the end of June, with the first 25 million doses being allocated to address surges, high disease burdens, and the needs of vulnerable countries. Approximately 75% of these doses will be shared through COVAX, with the rest going directly to countries experiencing surges and neighboring countries. The US aims to save lives and lead the world in ending the pandemic through vaccine sharing. They will continue to collaborate with democratic partners and prioritize global health security. More details on future vaccine sharing will be provided in the future.
