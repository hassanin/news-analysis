The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will award nearly $1 billion in grants to 85 airports across the country. The grants, funded by President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aim to improve airport terminals of all sizes. The funding will be used to expand capacity, increase energy efficiency, promote competition, and provide greater accessibility for individuals with disabilities. Additionally, two grants will be awarded for the construction and improvement of new air traffic control towers. The goal of these improvements is to enhance customer experiences, improve the movement of goods through the economy, lower prices, and increase U.S. competitiveness. The grants will also create job opportunities in communities across the country. The funding is part of the Airport Terminal Program, one of three aviation programs created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The law provides $1 billion annually for five years for Airport Terminal grants. The President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law aims to rebuild America's infrastructure, address the climate crisis, promote environmental justice, and create sustainable and equitable economic growth.
