Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado has expressed his support for a long-term extension of middle-class tax cuts, estate tax reform to protect small businesses, farmers, and ranchers, and an extension of unemployment insurance for struggling Coloradans. He acknowledges the frustration of Coloradans with the lack of agreement and compromise in Washington and emphasizes that if no action is taken, tax cuts will expire, leading to tax increases for hundreds of thousands of Coloradans and loss of unemployment benefits for thousands more. Senator Bennet states that while he would have written the bill differently, he intends to support the compromise because delaying the legislation would likely result in something worse. He also emphasizes the need for a more constructive and honest conversation to turn the economy around, and expresses his willingness to work with anyone, regardless of party affiliation, to develop a tax code that encourages innovation, builds the middle class, and brings jobs back to Colorado and the rest of the country.
