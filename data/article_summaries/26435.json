On May 12, 2014, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the situation in and in relation to the Central African Republic. This situation was characterized by a breakdown of law and order, sectarian tension, widespread violence and atrocities, and the forced recruitment and use of child soldiers. The national emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and it aimed to address the threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The President has now decided to extend the national emergency for another year, stating that the situation in the Central African Republic still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
