President Biden signed the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act into law, which aims to provide hope and new treatments for patients suffering from ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS is a debilitating disease that attacks the nervous system and weakens the muscles, leading to paralysis and eventually death. Despite the disease being first identified over 80 years ago, no cure has been found. The new law invests $100 million annually for the next five years to support research, improve access to therapies, and develop new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. The bill received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, with 331 co-sponsors in the House and 64 co-sponsors in the Senate. The President expressed his gratitude to the patients, caregivers, and members of Congress who championed this legislation and highlighted the importance of unity and collaboration in achieving significant progress in healthcare. President Biden also mentioned his commitment to advancing research and finding cures for other diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's, through the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).
