President Biden has announced the nominations of eight new federal judicial nominees and his intent to nominate nine federal judicial nominees. These nominees are described as extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and the Constitution. The President aims to ensure that the nation's courts reflect diversity in terms of personal and professional backgrounds. This round of nominations brings the total number of announced federal judicial nominees to 143. 

Among the nominees for the United States Circuit Court is Anthony Johnstone, a law professor at the University of Montana's Blewett School of Law. He has also worked as a solo practitioner and previously served as the Solicitor for the State of Montana.

For the United States District Court, the nominees include Charnelle Marie Bjelkengren, a judge on the Washington State Superior Court, Gordon Gallagher, a part-time United States Magistrate Judge in Colorado, Jonathan J.C. Grey, a United States Magistrate Judge in Michigan, Colleen Lawless, an Associate Judge in Illinois, Orelia Merchant, Chief Deputy Attorney General for State Counsel in New York, P. Casey Pitts, a partner at Altshuler Berzon LLP in California, Ramon Reyes, a United States Magistrate Judge in New York, and Arun Subramanian, a partner at Susman Godfrey LLP in New York.

These nominations highlight President Biden's commitment to strengthening the federal bench and filling judicial vacancies. He has already won confirmation for the most lower court judges in the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.
