On August 5, 2019, President Donald Trump issued executive orders related to foreign policy. The orders are aimed at taking additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692 of March 8, 2015, which blocked property and suspended entry of certain persons contributing to the situation in Venezuela. The new orders block all property and interests in property of the Government of Venezuela that are in the United States or come within the possession or control of any United States person. They also block property and interests in property of individuals or entities determined to have materially assisted or provided support to persons included on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. The orders also suspend the entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet certain criteria outlined in the order, unless the Secretary of State determines that their entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United States. The orders include prohibitions on certain transactions and conspiracies that violate the order. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to implement the order. The order is effective as of August 5, 2019.
