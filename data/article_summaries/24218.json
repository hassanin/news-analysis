President Obama will expand the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument off the coast of Hawaii, creating the world's largest marine protected area. The designation will quadruple the size of the existing marine monument, protecting coral reefs, deep sea marine habitats, and ecological resources in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. The expansion will provide critical protections for over 7,000 marine species, including endangered whales and sea turtles. It will also help improve ocean resilience in the face of climate change and preserve historical and cultural resources. Commercial resource extraction activities, such as fishing and mineral extraction, are prohibited within the expansion area. Noncommercial fishing, scientific research, and Native Hawaiian cultural practices are allowed by permit. The Departments of the Interior and Commerce will sign an agreement with Hawaii's Department of Natural Resources and Office of Hawaiian Affairs to give them a greater management role as a trustee in the monument. This expansion is a response to a proposal by Senator Brian Schatz and Native Hawaiian leaders, with support from local officials, cultural groups, conservation organizations, scientists, and fishermen. President Obama has been a champion of marine conservation, combating illegal fishing, establishing marine sanctuaries, and promoting science-based decision making.
