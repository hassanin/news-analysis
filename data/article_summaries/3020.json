During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki discussed two key topics. Firstly, she announced the Biden administration's new federal Overdose Prevention Strategy, which focuses on prevention, harm reduction, evidence-based treatment, and support during recovery in response to the evolving overdose epidemic. Psaki highlighted the importance of increasing access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder, strengthening the recovery support services workforce, and expanding access to harm reduction services. Secondly, Psaki provided an update on the efforts to address supply chain bottlenecks, noting that Union Pacific, one of the railroads servicing the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, will be offering a cash incentive for containers that move during the weekend. This is seen as a sign that the President's call for the private sector to help address supply chain challenges is working. Psaki also mentioned the progress made in reducing congestion and increasing capacity at ports and railroads.
