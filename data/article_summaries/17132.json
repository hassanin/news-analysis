This article discusses a presidential memorandum issued by President Barack Obama in 2013, which focuses on expanding America's leadership in wireless innovation. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of making additional spectrum available for wireless broadband use to promote economic development and provide greater coverage for citizens and businesses. It also highlights the need to ensure that government agencies can maintain their critical capabilities while meeting future requirements. The memorandum directs various agencies and offices to take actions to accelerate shared access to spectrum, collaborate on spectrum sharing, assess agency usage of spectrum, promote spectrum efficiency in procurements, establish performance criteria for radio receivers, provide incentives for agencies to share or relinquish spectrum, and enable rapid deployment of wireless broadband. The memorandum also revokes a previous memorandum issued in 2004 and emphasizes the importance of protecting classified and sensitive information.
