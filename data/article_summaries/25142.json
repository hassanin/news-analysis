On May 16, 2012, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the actions and policies of certain former members of the Government of Yemen and others that threatened Yemen's peace, security, and stability. This included obstructing the political process and blocking the implementation of a peaceful transition of power. The national emergency, which was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, was set to expire on May 16, 2019. However, President Trump has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, citing the ongoing threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
