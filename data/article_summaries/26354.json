President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declaration regarding the southern border of the United States will continue beyond February 15, 2020. This decision is based on the ongoing border security and humanitarian crisis, which poses a threat to national security. The executive branch has taken steps to address the crisis, but further action is needed to control unlawful migration, the flow of narcotics, and criminals across the southern border. Therefore, the President has determined it necessary to continue the national emergency.
