Gas prices have increased worldwide, including a nearly $2 per gallon increase in America, since Putin began amassing troops on the border of Ukraine. President Biden recognizes the impact of high gas prices on working families and has taken several actions to address the issue. This includes releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and encouraging oil companies and refiners to increase capacity and output. Now, President Biden is calling on Congress and states to provide direct relief to American consumers affected by the gas price hike. He is urging Congress to suspend the federal gas tax for three months, without affecting the Highway Trust Fund. Additionally, he is urging states to take similar actions, such as suspending their own gas taxes or providing other forms of relief. The President believes that while a gas tax holiday alone will not solve the problem, it can offer some breathing room for families during this challenging time. He is also calling on state and local governments to provide additional consumer relief, citing examples of temporary suspensions and delays in gas taxes and fee increases in some states. President Biden has been taking ongoing actions to mitigate the impact of the gas price increase, including increasing domestic oil production and transitioning towards clean energy in the long term.
