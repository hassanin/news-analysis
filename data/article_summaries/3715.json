On January 3, 2024, several governments issued a joint statement calling for an immediate end to illegal attacks in the Red Sea. Despite this warning, attacks have continued, including missiles and aerial vehicle attacks against ships on January 9, 2024. On January 10, 2024, the UN Security Council condemned these attacks and demanded they cease. In response, the armed forces of the United States and United Kingdom, with support from other countries, conducted joint strikes against Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen to disrupt their capabilities. The aim is to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, while defending the lives of mariners and the free flow of commerce in the region.
