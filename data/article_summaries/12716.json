President Obama will be awarding the Medal of Honor to Sergeant First Class Jared C. Monti posthumously for his heroic actions in combat in Afghanistan. Monti displayed immense courage and selflessness, sacrificing his own life in an effort to save his comrade. The ceremony will take place at the White House on Thursday, September 17th. Monti's parents, Paul Monti and Janet Monti, will be present to commemorate their son's example of service and sacrifice. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who demonstrate gallantry and self-sacrifice above and beyond the call of duty.
