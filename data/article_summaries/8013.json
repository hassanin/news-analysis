President Biden will host a White House reception in celebration of Pride Month. The event will be attended by the Vice President, the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and various LGBTQI+ leaders. The President will also invite members of Congress, appointees in his administration, LGBTQI+ state and local elected leaders, and grassroots advocates who have been fighting against anti-LGBTQI+ legislation. The President will highlight the progress his administration has made in advancing LGBTQI+ equality, such as strengthening protections, reversing the ban on transgender service members, and improving services for transgender Americans. He will also condemn the discriminatory attacks on LGBTQI+ children and families and sign an executive order on advancing equality for LGBTQI+ individuals. The executive order will protect LGBTQI+ youth from conversion therapy, address the mental health crisis among LGBTQI+ youth, improve the foster care system for LGBTQI+ children and parents, strengthen protections for LGBTQI+ older Americans, collect federal data on sexual orientation and gender identity, address LGBTQI+ homelessness and housing insecurity, and protect healthcare access for LGBTQI+ youth and families. The President continues to support the passage of the Equality Act.
