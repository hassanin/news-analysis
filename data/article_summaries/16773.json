In this presidential proclamation, President Barack Obama declares May 2016 as National Foster Care Month in the United States. He emphasizes the importance of providing foster youth with support and resources to help them achieve their dreams and fulfill their potential. The proclamation also acknowledges the challenges faced by children in the foster care system, including lower educational attainment and increased risk of entering the criminal justice system. The President outlines his commitment to preventing these negative outcomes by proposing the use of federal funds to provide services and shelter to foster youth who have aged out of the system. He also highlights the need for evidence-based screening and treatment of mental health disorders for children in foster care and the extension of Medicaid coverage to foster children until the age of 26. Additionally, the proclamation emphasizes the importance of supportive families and the fight for adoption and foster care opportunities for eligible and qualified caretakers, regardless of their race, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation. The President calls on all Americans to observe National Foster Care Month by supporting youth in foster care and recognizing the dedication of those who work to improve their lives.
