President Obama will meet with Afghan President Ghani and Chief Executive Officer Abdullah, along with other members of their unity government, at the White House on March 24, 2015. The two presidents will discuss various issues, including security, economic development, and U.S. support for the Afghan-led reconciliation process. This meeting is significant as it is the first between the two presidents since the 2014 presidential election, which marked the first democratic transfer of power in Afghanistan's history. President Ghani will also participate in a high-level strategic dialogue at Camp David during his visit, emphasizing the importance of bilateral cooperation and the American commitment to the U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership.
