Vice President Biden and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have announced the selection of 15 communities in the US to serve as pilot communities for health information technology (IT) through the Beacon Community program. The program aims to achieve improvements in health care quality, safety, and efficiency in these communities, while also laying the foundation for a health IT industry that is expected to create tens of thousands of jobs. Each community has specific goals in areas such as quality, cost-efficiency, and population health. For example, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the program will help physicians and providers participate in a new health information system to improve care transitions, increase access to care for patients with diabetes through telemedicine, and reduce preventable hospitalizations and emergency department visits. The Beacon projects are expected to create jobs and accelerate the development of a nationwide health IT infrastructure. The program is part of the federal government's $100 billion investment in science, innovation, and technology through the Recovery Act.
