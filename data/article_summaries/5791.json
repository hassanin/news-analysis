The United States, along with its allies and partners, is exposing and criticizing the People's Republic of China's (PRC) malicious cyber activities. The PRC's behavior in cyberspace is seen as irresponsible and destabilizing, contradicting its claim of being a responsible leader. The allies and partners, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, and NATO, are joining the United States in calling out the PRC's activities and taking action to counter them. This collective approach enhances information sharing, strengthens cybersecurity, and promotes diplomatic engagement. The Biden administration is specifically exposing the PRC's use of criminal contract hackers for unsanctioned cyber operations, and the United States Department of Justice is imposing costs and announcing criminal charges against four MSS hackers. The PRC's theft of intellectual property and confidential business information, including critical public health information, is a major concern. The Biden administration is also attributing with a high degree of confidence that PRC-affiliated cyber actors conducted cyber espionage operations using zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server. The response to this incident has strengthened US cyber defenses, focusing on expelling malicious actors and patching vulnerabilities. The administration is working to modernize federal networks and improve the nation's cybersecurity, urging private sector companies to align their cybersecurity investments with the goal of minimizing future incidents.
