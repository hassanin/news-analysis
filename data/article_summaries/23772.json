Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, and Miami Mayor Manny Diaz announced the availability of $8.4 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to repair and build America's public transportation infrastructure. The announcement took place at the future site of the Miami Intermodal Center, which will serve as a hub for all types of mass transit. The Florida Department of Transportation plans to use $2.1 million of the funds to relocate an aging Miami Greyhound Terminal to become part of the intermodal center. The U.S. Department of Transportation has already committed $540 million in federally financed loans for the intermodal center, and the projects will be monitored for state compliance and job creation.
