In this letter, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. informs the Speaker of the House that he has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to Cuba, which was declared on March 1, 1996, will continue beyond March 1, 2023. The President states that there is a need to continue this national emergency due to a disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations with Cuba. He highlights that the unauthorized entry of any United States-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters is detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States and a violation of federal law. The President also emphasizes that such unauthorized entries are counter to the purpose of Executive Order 12807, which aims to ensure safe, orderly, and legal migration. He expresses concern that large-scale unauthorized entries of US-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters could lead to a mass migration of Cuban nationals and threaten national security.
