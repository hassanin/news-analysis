The United States, along with its allies and partners, is imposing severe economic costs on Russia in response to its aggression towards Ukraine. The actions include financial sanctions and export controls that will have a profound impact on Russia's economy, financial system, and access to cutting-edge technology. The financial sanctions target Russia's largest financial institutions, while export control measures will restrict Russia's access to high-tech imports. This will isolate Russia from the global financial system and hinder its strategic ambitions. The international community is cooperating in imposing similar actions, further increasing the pressure on Russia. Russia will face immediate and intense pressure on its economy and significant costs from its isolation. Its ability to access global markets, attract investment, and utilize the US dollar will be devastated. These measures will suppress Russia's economic growth, increase borrowing costs, raise inflation, intensify capital outflows, and erode its industrial base. The United States and its allies will continue to impose costs on Russia until it changes its course.
