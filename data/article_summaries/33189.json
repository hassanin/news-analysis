During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced that President Trump had signed a new executive order that continues to protect the nation from terrorists entering the United States. The new executive order addresses the court's concerns with the initial travel ban and includes a 90-day suspension of travel to the US from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Spicer also stated that more than 300 people who have entered the US as refugees are currently under counterterrorism investigations by the FBI. Additionally, he mentioned that President Trump had a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss regional security challenges. Spicer did not provide any evidence to support President Trump's recent tweets accusing President Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower during the election.
