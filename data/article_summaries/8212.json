The bipartisan Senate vote to advance the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 is seen as a crucial step in providing healthcare and benefits to veterans and survivors affected by toxic exposures. This legislation is highly significant and represents a substantial expansion of benefits and services in the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans and advocates have emphasized the importance of this legislation, and the Senate has worked together to address concerns and ensure effective implementation. It has taken a long time to understand the harmful effects of environmental exposures, leaving many veterans without the necessary support. President Biden is committed to delivering for veterans and sees it as a key aspect of the Unity Agenda outlined in the State of the Union address. He looks forward to working with Congress to swiftly enact this legislation and fulfill the obligation to support those who have served our nation, including their families, caregivers, and survivors.
