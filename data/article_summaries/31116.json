President Donald J. Trump has commuted the prison sentence of Ronen Nahmani, a non-violent, first-time offender with no criminal history. Nahmani has five young children at home and his wife is suffering from terminal cancer, making his case for clemency urgent. This action has received strong support from notable leaders across the political spectrum, including Representatives Hakeem Jeffries and Mark Meadows, former United States Attorneys General Edwin Meese and Michael Mukasey, former Solicitor General Seth Waxman, Senators Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, and many others. Members of Congress and a broad cross-section of the legal community have expressed their support for clemency for Nahmani.
