On September 11, 2019, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump led a moment of silence on the White House South Lawn to commemorate the victims of the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. The President later traveled to the Pentagon to address victims' families and members of the Armed Services. Last year, the President and First Lady visited the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania to pay tribute to the passengers and crew who took control of their destiny and changed the course of history. Since 9/11, nearly 6 million Americans have enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces, with almost 7,000 sacrificing their lives to protect the country. The Vice President, Mike Pence, emphasized the importance of ensuring that each generation understands the story and lessons of 9/11. President Trump also signed into law the permanent authorization of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, providing support to victims, their families, first responders, and those involved in rescue and recovery operations at Ground Zero.
