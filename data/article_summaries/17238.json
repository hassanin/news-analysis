President Obama has proclaimed April 20-28, 2013, as National Park Week in the United States. This week is dedicated to celebrating the natural inheritance that has been preserved by generations of Americans. It is a time to remember the beauty and significance of national parks, such as the Grand Canyon and the Teton Range, which represent freedom, independence, and the collective responsibility to protect our land. During National Park Week, the National Park Service will offer free admission to all parks from April 22-26. President Obama has also established eight new National Monuments in the past year, honoring important figures and landscapes in American history. This reflects his commitment to a 21st-century conservation strategy that aligns with the priorities of the American people, strengthens local economies, and safeguards special places for future generations. The President encourages all Americans to experience the outdoors and visit their National Parks during this week.
