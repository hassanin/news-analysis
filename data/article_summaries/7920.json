The White House COVID-19 Response Team provided an update on their efforts to help states battling surging COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant, particularly those impacted by Hurricane Ida. They have deployed medical personnel and supplies to support healthcare systems in the affected states. The team is also working with 18 states to address their specific needs and has seen an 80% increase in the number of daily vaccinations administered compared to mid-July. Vaccination requirements have been implemented by federal agencies, colleges, universities, healthcare employers, and businesses, leading to increased vaccination rates. The team emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated, especially before the upcoming Labor Day weekend. They also provided guidelines for keeping children safe in schools, including universal masking and improved ventilation. The team urged pregnant women to get vaccinated, as there are severe adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. The FDA-approved vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in pregnant and lactating women. The team advised caution for those considering travel, especially for unvaccinated individuals. They emphasized the importance of wearing masks in public indoor settings. The team addressed concerns about the resignations of two top FDA regulators, stating that the FDA remains the gold standard, and their critical work continues. The decision to recommend booster shots was made based on available data, and the FDA will conduct an independent evaluation before making a final recommendation. The team will continue to monitor data on waning vaccine effectiveness and adjust their approach accordingly. They are working closely with states impacted by Hurricane Ida to ensure the safe storage and administration of vaccines.
