President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on May 31, 2018 regarding the adjustment of imports of steel mill articles into the United States. The proclamation states that steel mill articles are being imported into the US in quantities and circumstances that threaten to impair national security. As a result, a 25 percent ad valorem tariff was imposed on steel articles imported from most countries starting from March 23, 2018. However, countries such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and the European Union (EU) were exempted from the tariff due to ongoing discussions and satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to national security posed by their steel article imports. The United States has reached agreements with these countries, including measures to reduce excess steel production and capacity, increase capacity utilization in the US, prevent transshipment of steel articles, and avoid import surges. Therefore, the President has determined that steel article imports from these countries no longer threaten national security and have decided to exclude them from the tariff. The proclamation also notes that the current tariff level will be maintained for other countries, and the implementation and effectiveness of the agreed-upon measures will be monitored. The proclamation is made under the authority vested in the President by various trade acts and laws.
