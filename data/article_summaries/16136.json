The article is a transcript of a press briefing by White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney. He addresses questions regarding the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime and the US government's response. Carney explains that the White House has assessed with varying degrees of confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons, specifically the chemical agent sarin. However, they are working to establish credible and corroborated facts to build a definitive judgment and inform their decision-making about next steps. Carney emphasizes that the President takes the issue seriously and that all options remain on the table. He also discusses the FAA legislation and the sequester, stating that the President would sign the FAA bill but it is only a Band-Aid solution to a bigger problem. Carney reiterates the need for Congress to take action and eliminate the sequester entirely through balanced deficit reduction. The briefing also touches on other topics like immigration reform and Guantanamo Bay.
