The call discussed the anticipated implementation of a consular deal with Iran, which is expected to result in the release of five American citizens who have been wrongfully imprisoned in Iran. The deal involves the exchange of prisoners and the transfer of Iranian funds from a restricted account in South Korea to a restricted account in Qatar. The funds will be used exclusively for humanitarian transactions, such as food, medicine, medical devices, and agricultural products. The call emphasized that this deal does not change the United States' adversarial relationship with Iran and that the U.S. will continue to hold Iran accountable for its actions. The officials also mentioned the imposition of new sanctions against Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The call concluded by stating that the return of the American citizens will bring closure to their families and that the U.S. will continue its efforts to prevent future wrongful detentions.
