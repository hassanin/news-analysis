The United States and the European Union have issued a joint statement condemning the human rights violations in Iran since the June 12 election. They express concern over the large-scale detentions, mass trials, threatened execution of protestors, intimidation of their families, and the denial of the right to peaceful expression. They call on the Iranian government to fulfill its international human rights obligations, put an end to the abuses, hold those responsible accountable, and release those who are exercising their rights. They are particularly concerned about the potential for further violence and repression around the anniversary of the Islamic Republic's founding on February 11.
