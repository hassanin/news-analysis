The White House is pleased that Congress has passed a bipartisan bill to prevent student loan interest rates from doubling and to invest in infrastructure projects. President Obama had been urging Congress to address these priorities before middle-class families suffered the consequences. As a result of Congress taking action, millions of students will avoid a $1,000 increase in debt and construction workers will be able to keep their jobs. However, the statement highlights that there is still more that Congress can do to stimulate job growth and the economy, and the President will continue to push for the passage of his American Jobs Act, which economists believe could create another million jobs.
