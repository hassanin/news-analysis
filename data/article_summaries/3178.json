President Biden is urging schools to use the $122 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan (ARP) to expand programming and services that will help students recover from learning loss caused by the pandemic. He is encouraging schools to provide high-quality tutoring, summer learning and enrichment, and afterschool programs to support students' academic and mental health needs. To further support students, the Biden-Harris Administration is launching the National Partnership for Student Success (NPSS) in collaboration with leading organizations. NPSS aims to recruit 250,000 tutors and mentors over the next three years to provide additional support to students. The administration is also prioritizing the use of Volunteer Generation Funds to recruit and manage up to 200,000 additional volunteers in critical positions in schools. Various organizations, such as Accelerate, Afterschool Alliance, and Boys and Girls Clubs of America, are participating in NPSS to support student success.
