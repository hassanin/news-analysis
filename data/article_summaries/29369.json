On April 4, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536 in relation to Somalia will continue for another year. The national emergency was initially declared in 2010 due to the deteriorating security situation and violence in Somalia, acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and violations of the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council. The memorandum also mentions the misappropriation of Somali public assets and acts of violence committed against civilians in Somalia. The President's decision to extend the national emergency is based on the belief that the situation in Somalia continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The memorandum will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
