The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to taking bold actions to combat ransomware and has convened the International Counter Ransomware Initiative (CRI) for its third meeting. The CRI brings together 50 members, including 48 countries, the European Union, and INTERPOL, to discuss new projects and policy commitments. Thirteen new members have joined the initiative this year. The CRI focuses on resilience, cooperation, and disruption through its Policy Pillar, Diplomacy and Capacity Building Pillar, and the International Counter Ransomware Task Force (ICRTF). The Policy Pillar aims to undermine the ransomware business model and improve incident reporting and information sharing. The Diplomacy and Capacity Building Pillar expands partnerships and develops capacity building programs. The ICRTF launches operational tools and facilitates information sharing. The CRI has achieved successes in increasing capacity, enhancing cybersecurity, and disrupting ransomware actors. The Policy Pillar addresses key policy questions, such as ransomware payments and cyber insurance. The Diplomacy and Capacity Building Pillar adds new members and promotes capacity building efforts. The ICRTF launches projects and platforms to respond to ransomware incidents and facilitates law enforcement collaboration. The CRI plans to continue expanding international collaboration, promoting cybersecurity standards, and developing capacity building programs.
