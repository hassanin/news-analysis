The White House has launched a campaign to cut waste and make the government more accountable. The Vice President has been tasked with holding the Cabinet accountable for cutting waste in their agencies. The campaign will build on the Accountable Government Initiative, which has already tackled waste and inefficiency in various areas of the government. The President has signed an Executive Order establishing a new oversight and accountability board to help federal agencies improve their performance and reduce waste, fraud, and abuse. Cabinet members will also be required to report progress directly to the Vice President. As one of the first steps, the Administration will target duplication and waste among federal websites, aiming to reduce the number of separate sites by 50% over the next year.
