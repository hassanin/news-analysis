The article discusses the efforts of the U.S. government to safeguard classified information and networks following the unauthorized disclosure of classified information by WikiLeaks in 2010. The National Security Staff formed an interagency committee to review policies and practices surrounding the handling of classified information and make recommendations to reduce the risk of future breaches. The guiding principles during the review were to reinforce responsible information sharing, evolve policies and oversight mechanisms, coordinate efforts across the entire federal government, and respect privacy and civil liberties. The committee proposed a new oversight structure, which is reflected in the Executive Order signed by President Obama. The order requires agencies to designate a senior official to oversee information sharing and safeguarding, implement insider threat detection and prevention programs, and perform self-assessments of compliance. A Senior Information Sharing and Safeguarding Steering Committee and a Classified Information Sharing and Safeguarding Office will be responsible for coordinating interagency efforts and ensuring accountability. The Department of Defense and the National Security Agency will jointly act as the Executive Agent for Safeguarding Classified Information on Computer Networks. An Insider Threat Task Force will develop a government-wide program for insider threat detection and prevention. The government has already made progress in areas such as removable media, online identity management, insider threat programs, access control, and enterprise audit.
