President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Illinois and ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes on November 17, 2013. The declaration makes federal funding available for affected individuals in several counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed a Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are still ongoing, and additional counties may receive assistance after assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance through the FEMA website or by calling a toll-free number. Media inquiries can be directed to the FEMA News Desk.
