This article is a notice from the White House, stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism. The national emergency was originally declared on September 23, 2001, in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The President took this action to address the threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy posed by these acts of terrorism. The national emergency and the measures adopted to deal with it must continue beyond September 23, 2012, as the actions of these individuals still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
