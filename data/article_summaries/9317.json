This memorandum, issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., focuses on protecting access to reproductive healthcare services, specifically regarding the medication mifepristone. The memorandum highlights that mifepristone has been approved by the FDA as a safe and effective method to end early pregnancy since 2000. It mentions that the FDA modified the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for mifepristone in January 2023, allowing healthcare providers and patients to use telehealth to prescribe and receive the medication by mail. The in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone was permanently removed. However, there have been reports of efforts to suppress access to medication abortion, with some state officials imposing restrictions. The memorandum emphasizes the need to protect and expand access to abortion care, including medication abortion, and ensure the safety and security of patients, providers, and pharmacies. It mentions the formation of a Reproductive Rights Task Force by the Department of Justice and efforts by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to protect access to reproductive healthcare. The memorandum directs the Secretary of HHS to consider issuing guidance for patients and providers seeking legal access to mifepristone and taking further actions to educate individuals on their ability to seek legal reproductive care. It also instructs the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Secretary of HHS to provide information to the Interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access regarding barriers faced by patients and providers and any recommendations to address these barriers. The memorandum concludes by emphasizing the commitment to protecting access to mifepristone and defending women's fundamental freedoms.
