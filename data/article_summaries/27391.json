The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has violated its international commitments and promises to the people of Hong Kong by disqualifying pro-democracy legislators from the Legislative Council. This action undermines the "One Country, Two Systems" principle and exposes the CCP's expanding one-party dictatorship in Hong Kong. The United States is committed to using its powers under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, and the Executive Order on Hong Kong Normalization to identify and sanction those responsible for suppressing Hong Kong's freedom.
