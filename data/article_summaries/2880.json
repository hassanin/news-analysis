If Republican officials get their way, tens of millions of Americans will not receive relief from their student loan debt. The Biden Administration's student debt relief plan, which allows individuals with incomes less than $125,000 per year to apply for debt relief, has already received close to 26 million applications. By the end of the week, 16 million applications will have been approved. The plan also cuts monthly payments in half for borrowers with remaining undergraduate loan balances. However, Republican officials have sued to prevent those most affected by the pandemic from receiving relief. They are also proposing a $3 trillion giveaway for Big Pharma, corporations, and the ultra-wealthy. If Republican officials succeed, working and middle-class Americans will continue to be burdened by loan debt, hindering their ability to achieve homeownership, save for retirement, or start small businesses.
