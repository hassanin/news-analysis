The President will host the next White House Tribal Nations Summit on December 6 and 7 in Washington, D.C. The summit aims to strengthen Nation-to-Nation relationships with Tribal Nations, honor treaty obligations, and advance Tribal sovereignty and self-determination. It brings together Tribal leaders and top Administration officials to address important issues facing Tribal communities. The summit will also feature new Administration actions to support Tribal communities, building on the President's previous achievements, such as record investments in Tribal Nations and Native communities, addressing the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous people, securing funding for Indian Health Service, and forming partnerships with Tribal Nations to co-steward their ancestral lands and waters.
