The White House released a statement on the 25th anniversary of the Halabja Massacre, a chemical weapons attack by Saddam Hussein's regime that killed over 5,000 innocent civilians in Iraq's Kurdistan Region. The attack also left at least 10,000 people blinded and maimed. The statement acknowledges that this massacre was part of Hussein's larger Anfal Campaign, which resulted in the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis. The statement honors the memory of those who lost their lives and emphasizes the importance of preventing future atrocities and holding the perpetrators accountable.
