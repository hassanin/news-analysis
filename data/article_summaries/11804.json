In this statement, President Obama discusses the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and its importance for working families during tax season. He highlights that the Recovery Act expanded the credit for larger families and reduced the marriage penalty. However, many Americans are unaware that they qualify for the credit. The President encourages people to visit the IRS website for more information on the EITC and other tax breaks available for working Americans. Additionally, he mentions that community organizations and the IRS provide free tax help sites and services, including Free File, a software service for preparing and e-filing federal tax returns.
