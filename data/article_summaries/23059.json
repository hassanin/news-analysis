The joint statement between President Barack Obama and President Enrique Peña Nieto emphasizes their commitment to addressing global climate change. They believe that taking smart action on climate change and developing clean energy can drive economic growth and bring various benefits to the region, such as security, health, and development. The two countries plan to harmonize their efforts and policies towards their common climate goals. They will establish a high-level bilateral clean energy and climate policy task force, chaired by Secretary Ernest Moniz and Secretary Juan José Guerra Abud, to coordinate policy and regulation in areas such as clean electricity, grid modernization, energy efficiency, and fuel efficiency in automobile fleets. The task force will also collaborate with the Clean Energy Ministerial hosted by Mexico in May. Additionally, the countries commit to cooperating on air quality and climate policy, including implementing emission standards for diesel and light-duty vehicles, reducing reliance on HFCs, and cooperating on black carbon.
