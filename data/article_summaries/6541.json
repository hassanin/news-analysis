On May 22, 2003, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the threat posed by obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq and the establishment of peace, security, and political and economic institutions in the country. This national emergency, initially declared in Executive Order 13303, has been modified and extended several times over the years, most recently in Executive Order 13668. President Biden has now announced that the national emergency will continue for another year, beyond May 22, 2021, citing the ongoing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This decision is made in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
