The President commends the Senate for confirming Vivek Murthy as the next Surgeon General. Murthy, known as "America's Doctor," will use his extensive experience in public health to address various priorities, such as preventing new diseases and promoting the health of children. Additionally, Murthy will contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat Ebola, both domestically and internationally. The confirmation of Murthy, along with the support provided in the government funding bill, strengthens the nation's ability to save lives globally and protect Americans from health threats.
