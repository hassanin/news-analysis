On December 8, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 4783, the "Claims Resolution Act of 2010." This Act provides funding and statutory authorities for the settlement agreements reached in various lawsuits, including the Cobell lawsuit brought by Native Americans, the Pigford II lawsuit brought by African American farmers, and four separate water rights suits brought by Native American tribes. The Act also includes authorities proposed by the Obama Administration concerning Unemployment Compensation program integrity, allowing the Federal Government to recover certain Unemployment Compensation debts from individual income tax overpayments. The President acknowledges that while this Act represents progress, more work needs to be done to address claims of past discrimination made by women and Hispanic farmers against the Department of Agriculture, as well as the needs of tribal communities. The Administration is also working with Congress to correct a technical drafting error in order to implement the program integrity provisions as intended.
