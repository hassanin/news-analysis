The Council of Economic Advisers has released a quarterly report on the economic impact of the Recovery Act, showing that it played a key role in changing the trajectory of the economy. The Act added 2.7% to third-quarter GDP growth and has exceeded the goal of creating or saving 3.5 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also highlights that the third quarter saw the biggest public investment spending yet, with over $33 billion spent on clean energy, transportation, and infrastructure projects. Public investment spending was responsible for over 1 million jobs nationwide. Clean energy investments accounted for nearly a quarter of these jobs. The report also states that less than $20 billion of discretionary program funding remains unobligated, and eight states have seen an impact of over 100,000 Recovery Act jobs.
