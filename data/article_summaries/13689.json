The White House held a press conference call to discuss additional steps being taken in the counter-ISIL effort. The call included four senior administration officials: Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications; Jeff Prescott, NSC Senior Director for Iran, Iraq, Syria, and the Gulf States; Elissa Slotkin, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs; and Brett McGurk, Deputy Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL. The officials discussed the strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, focusing on efforts within Iraq and Syria. They announced that the President has authorized the deployment of additional U.S. military personnel to train and assist Iraqi security forces at Taqaddum military base in eastern Anbar Province. They also mentioned the expedited delivery of equipment and materiel to Iraqi forces, as well as the establishment of an international fund to provide assistance to Iraqi communities that have been recently freed from ISIL control. The officials stated that the President is open to considering further refinements to the strategy and that the focus is on strengthening Iraqi capacity on the ground. They addressed concerns about the number of foreign fighters crossing into Iraq and Syria and discussed the need to recruit capable Iraqis who are willing to be trained and fight against ISIL. The officials acknowledged the risk involved in deploying U.S. forces to Iraq and stated that force protection is a top priority.
