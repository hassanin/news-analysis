This article is a presidential memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on March 22, 2012. The memorandum discusses the need to expedite the review of pipeline projects from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Port Arthur, Texas, and other domestic pipeline infrastructure projects. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of developing oil resources in the United States to reduce dependence on foreign oil and improve energy security. It highlights the need for an energy infrastructure system that can keep pace with advances in oil production. The memorandum also mentions the bottleneck in Cushing, Oklahoma, where more oil is flowing in than can flow out, hindering new production and restricting oil from reaching refineries on the Gulf Coast. It states that moving forward with a pipeline from Cushing to Port Arthur could create jobs, promote American energy production, and benefit consumers. The memorandum calls for agencies to coordinate and expedite their reviews, consultations, and decision-making processes related to domestic pipeline infrastructure projects. It also encourages the use of information from previous environmental reviews and studies to avoid duplicating efforts. The memorandum concludes with general provisions and authorizes the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
