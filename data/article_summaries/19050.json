This article is a notice from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia. The national emergency was declared in 1995 due to the threat posed by these traffickers to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, as well as the violence, corruption, and harm caused by their actions. The President has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, stating that the actions of these traffickers still pose a threat to the United States and cause significant harm.
