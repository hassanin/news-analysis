The article discusses the issue of unaccompanied alien children (UACs) entering the United States and the loopholes in the current immigration system that allow this to happen. It highlights a case where two teenage girls were assaulted and killed by members of the MS-13 gang, who had entered the country as unaccompanied minors. The article explains that under current law, UACs must be transferred to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) within 72 hours of being apprehended. However, once released by ORR, UACs usually remain in the country. The article argues that this system is dangerous as UACs can be targeted by gangs for recruitment and violence. It also states that UACs frequently fail to appear for immigration hearings, adding to the backlog of unresolved cases. The article calls for Congress to amend the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act to provide special protections for UACs who are victims of trafficking and to allow for the prompt and safe repatriation of those who are not.
