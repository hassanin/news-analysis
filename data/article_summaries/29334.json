President Trump recently signed the Great American Outdoors Act into law, which provides funding for land and water conservation and addresses the maintenance backlog in national parks and public lands. The legislation guarantees $900 million a year for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and allocates nearly $10 billion for maintenance projects in parks and public lands. The President commended the bipartisan effort behind the bill and emphasized the importance of preserving America's natural treasures for future generations.
