On October 22, 2019, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to establish an advisory council on science and technology. The purpose of this council is to harness American ingenuity and drive technological progress in order to maintain American technological dominance. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) will be composed of the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and additional members appointed by the President. The council will advise the President on matters related to science, technology, education, and innovation policy, as well as provide scientific and technical information to inform public policy. The PCAST will also serve as advisory committees for the High-Performance Computing Act and the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. The executive order outlines the administration, functions, and termination of the PCAST, and emphasizes the importance of collaboration between government, industry, and academia. The executive order revokes a previous executive order related to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.
