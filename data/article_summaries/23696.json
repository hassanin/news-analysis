President Barack Obama has proclaimed the establishment of the Stonewall National Monument in New York City. The monument consists of Christopher Park, a historic community park located across the street from the Stonewall Inn, which played a key role in the Stonewall Uprising, a significant event in the LGBT civil rights movement. The park has long been a gathering place for the LGBT community and is central to the identity of the Greenwich Village neighborhood. The Stonewall Uprising, which took place in 1969, sparked a nationwide movement for LGBT rights. The monument aims to preserve and protect the historic objects associated with the Stonewall Uprising and to interpret the LGBT civil rights movement. The National Park Service will manage the monument and will develop a management plan in coordination with the City of New York.
