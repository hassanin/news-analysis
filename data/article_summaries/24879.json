President Obama has declared a major disaster in Alaska and ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts from severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between November 5-14, 2013. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Dolph A. Diemont has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
