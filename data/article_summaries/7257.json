Speaker McCarthy and I have reached a budget agreement in principle that reduces spending while protecting important programs. It is a compromise that protects key priorities and legislative accomplishments. This agreement is good news for the American people as it prevents a catastrophic default and economic recession. The next step is for both the House and Senate to pass the agreement quickly.
