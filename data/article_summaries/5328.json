President Biden will visit the Wisconsin Black Chamber of Commerce to highlight the growth of Black small businesses under his administration and announce new investments in Milwaukee and other communities. The United States is on track to have the three strongest years in history for new small business applications, with Black business ownership growing at the fastest pace in 30 years. President Biden will be joined by the founder and owner of Hero Plumbing, a Black-owned small business, which will benefit from the historic $15 billion in funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. While President Biden emphasizes his support for small businesses, including Black-owned businesses, Republicans in Congress have opposed his small business agenda. President Biden will continue fighting for opportunities for working families and small business owners, while Republicans want to return to failed trickle-down economics. The President understands the importance of diversity in economic security and has made unprecedented investments in Black communities. Since taking office, Americans have filed a record 15 million applications to start new businesses. Black business ownership is growing, and the share of Black households owning a business has doubled between 2019 and 2022. Black wealth is up 60% from before the pandemic, and Black unemployment has reached historic lows. President Biden will announce that the Grow Milwaukee Coalition is one of 22 finalists for the Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration Distressed Area Recompete Pilot Program, which aims to invest in job creation, small business growth, and economic opportunity in disadvantaged communities. The proposal would revitalize Milwaukee's 30th Street Industrial Corridor and support Black-owned businesses and entrepreneurship. The 22 finalists will compete for $190 million in funding for locally-led economic development plans.
