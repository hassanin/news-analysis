President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in Alaska due to a landslide that occurred on May 7, 2022. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected area, specifically the Kenai Peninsula Borough. Federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, as well as the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Yolanda J. Jackson has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations, with additional designations possible in the future if requested by the state and based on further damage assessments.
