Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics Mike Pyle co-chaired the first meeting of the Ukraine Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform's Steering Committee. The meeting brought together representatives from G7 countries, the Government of Ukraine, and international financial institutions to discuss how to coordinate economic support for Ukraine's immediate financing needs and future economic recovery. They pledged to work closely with Ukrainian authorities to define, prioritize, and sequence strategic economic needs and to deliver economic assistance to stabilize Ukraine's economy. Pyle commended the Ukrainian government's management of its economy and its vision for economic reform. The Steering Committee will continue to collaborate in the coming weeks, with its next meeting scheduled for March.
