The President has issued an executive order imposing new sanctions on North Korea in response to their recent nuclear test and missile launch. This order enables the US to implement UN Security Council Resolution 2270 and the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016. The US is committed to applying sustained pressure on North Korea and will continue to impose costs until it complies with its international obligations.
