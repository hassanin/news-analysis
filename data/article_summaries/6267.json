United States Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai has announced that the U.S. and EU have reached a 5-year agreement to resolve the 16-year-long Boeing-Airbus dispute. This agreement aims to challenge and counter China's non-market practices in the aerospace sector and reflects the standards for fair competition. The deal includes the suspension of U.S.-EU tariffs for five years, as long as EU support for Airbus remains consistent with the terms of the agreement. If EU support crosses a red line and U.S. producers cannot compete fairly, the U.S. retains the flexibility to reactivate the tariffs. The agreement also involves cooperation on countering investments in the aircraft sector by non-market actors and joint action against other non-market practices. The deal will go into effect by extending the suspension of tariffs until July 11. Discussions will continue between the U.S. and EU on outstanding subsidies to Airbus. The agreement is seen as a step towards renewing the U.S.-EU trade and investment partnership and addressing shared concerns with unfair economic practices.
