The White House has issued a notice stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to certain terrorist attacks. This emergency was initially declared on September 14, 2001, following the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. The emergency declaration and its associated powers and authorities are necessary due to the ongoing threat of further attacks on the United States. Therefore, the national emergency will remain in effect for an additional year, beyond September 14, 2012. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress. The notice was issued by President Barack Obama on September 11, 2012.
