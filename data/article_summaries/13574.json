The White House released a report highlighting the costs of repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The report emphasizes the benefits of the ACA, such as lower costs, new protections, and expanded access to quality, affordable care. It states that the repeal plan pushed by some Republicans in Congress would undermine or eliminate these benefits that millions of middle-class Americans rely on. The report also provides statistics on the number of Americans who have gained coverage for preventive health care services, the number of Americans with pre-existing conditions who no longer have to worry about being denied coverage, the number of uninsured Americans who now have new health insurance options, and the savings consumers have experienced due to the requirement that insurance companies spend a certain percentage of premium dollars on patient care. The report concludes by urging Republicans in Congress to stop trying to repeal the ACA, as doing so would raise premiums, allow discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, and eliminate discounts for seniors on prescription drugs.
