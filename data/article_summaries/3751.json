The Supreme Court has allowed Idaho's extreme abortion ban to be reinstated, disregarding the critical emergency abortion care required by federal law. The overturning of Roe v. Wade has emboldened Republican officials to pursue dangerous abortion bans, putting women's health at risk, forcing them to travel out of state for care, and making it harder for doctors to provide necessary treatment, even in emergencies. These restrictive bans are causing doctors to leave Idaho and other states due to laws that interfere with their ability to care for patients. The Vice President and the author of the article believe that healthcare decisions should be made by women and their doctors, not politicians. They vow to continue defending a woman's right to access emergency care under federal law. The article emphasizes the urgent need for Congress to reinstate the protections of Roe v. Wade to ensure that women in every state can access the healthcare they require.
