President Obama and Vice President Biden held a meeting of the Middle Class Task Force, where they discussed key investments for middle class families. The discussion previewed one of the key themes of the President's State of the Union address, which included creating good jobs, addressing the deficit, changing Washington, and fighting for middle class families. The Task Force proposed several policy initiatives to help middle class families, such as nearly doubling the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, increasing child care funding, limiting student loan payments, creating automatic workplace IRAs, expanding retirement savings tax credits, and supporting families balancing work with caring for elderly relatives. The Task Force's final report and full recommendations will be released in February. The Middle Class Task Force is chaired by Vice President Joe Biden and includes top-level administration policy makers focused on developing policies to raise the living standards of middle-class, working families in America.
