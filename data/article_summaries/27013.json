President Trump presented the Congressional Medal of Honor to Sergeant Major Thomas Patrick Payne in recognition of his heroic actions during a rescue mission in Iraq in 2015. Payne, an Army Ranger, led a team that rescued 75 Kurdish prisoners from ISIS terrorists. Despite facing heavy gunfire and suicide bombings, Payne and his team successfully freed the hostages and killed 20 ISIS terrorists. Payne's bravery and selflessness earned him the highest military honor in the United States. President Trump also acknowledged the sacrifice of Master Sergeant Josh Wheeler, who lost his life during the mission, and honored his wife, Ashley Wheeler, who was present at the ceremony.
