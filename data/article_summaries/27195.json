This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued on July 22, 2019, regarding the determination of the domestic manufacturing capability for F135 Integrally Bladed Rotors as essential to national defense. The memorandum states that without Presidential action, the United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the production capability for manufacturing F135 Integrally Bladed Rotors adequately and in a timely manner. It further states that purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 are the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need for this critical capability. The memorandum authorizes and directs the Secretary of Defense to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
