President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 25 through May 31, 2014, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of careful planning and preparation to protect individuals, families, and communities from the destructive impact of hurricanes. The President highlights the need for collaboration between the federal government, state and local governments, nonprofits, and private sector companies to strengthen relief efforts and improve communication during emergencies. The proclamation also acknowledges the projected increase in hurricane intensity, rainfall, and storm surges due to climate change, and emphasizes the commitment to increasing resilience, investing in scientific research, and cutting red tape to provide timely assistance. The President urges residents in at-risk areas to assemble emergency supply kits, create action plans, and stay informed about hurricane preparedness and response. The proclamation calls upon government agencies, private organizations, schools, media, and residents in coastal areas to share information to help save lives and protect communities.
