The U.S. is hosting the U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit, where leaders from Pacific Island nations will meet with President Biden to discuss various topics such as technology, fishing, education, and infrastructure. The summit aims to strengthen the U.S.'s commitment and engagement in the Pacific region. Prior to the formal meetings in Washington, D.C., the leaders will attend a football game and visit a Coast Guard cutter ship in Baltimore. The U.S. Coast Guard has been actively involved in combating illegal fishing in the Pacific. The summit will also focus on climate change and building resilience, with discussions led by Special Envoy for Climate, Secretary John Kerry. Additionally, the U.S. will announce various deliverables, including the recognition of two new Pacific Island nations, the Cook Islands and Niue, and the provision of secure undersea cable connectivity for Pacific Island nations. The U.S. is committed to revitalizing its diplomatic presence in the Pacific Islands, opening new embassies and regional missions. The summit is seen as a demonstration of the U.S.'s deep moral, strategic, and historic interests in the region. The U.S. is also strengthening partnerships with allies like Australia, New Zealand, and Japan to support initiatives addressing the needs of the Pacific Islands in areas such as climate change, training, and infrastructure.
