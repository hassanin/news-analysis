Fifteen years ago, the International Day of Democracy was established to support representative governance, equality, human rights, and the rule of law. However, democracy has faced challenges worldwide, with autocrats and illiberal forces pressuring those fighting for human rights. Examples include Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the need to protect American democracy. The United We Stand Summit at the White House aims to counter hate-fueled violence and promote a safe, inclusive, and democratic society. Despite challenges, recent months have shown that American democracy can still deliver for its people through transformative legislation. The United States is also collaborating with fellow democracies to address global challenges and will host the second Summit for Democracy next year. This summit will demonstrate how democracies are improving lives and combating authoritarianism, corruption, and advancing human rights. On this International Day of Democracy, we reflect on our responsibility to preserve democracy and uphold the rule of law, free and fair elections, and strengthen our precious democracy for future generations.
