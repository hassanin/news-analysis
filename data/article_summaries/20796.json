In this letter, President Barack Obama expresses his support for the recommendations made by the Commission on Care in its final report on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). He agrees with 15 of the 18 recommendations and highlights the ongoing transformation of the VA under the MyVA initiative. The President emphasizes the importance of creating a high-performing, integrated health care system that includes both VA and private care. He acknowledges the need to preserve and improve the VA health care system, as it provides specialized care and a comprehensive approach to wellness. The President urges Congress to act on the recommendation to consolidate community care and ensure the long-term viability and sustainability of the VA health care system. However, he raises concerns with the proposed governance structure for the VA health care system, stating that it would undermine the authority of the Secretary and make it harder for the VA to implement transformative change. The President directs the VA to develop plans to complete the implementation of the recommendations he agrees with and incorporates the principles of the MyVA initiative into VA strategic planning and leadership training. He pledges to work with various stakeholders to improve veterans' health care.
