The article discusses a press briefing held by Director Mulvaney and Marc Short on the potential government shutdown. Mulvaney criticizes Democrats for opposing a bill that they don't actually oppose, and accuses them of wanting a shutdown for political reasons. Short mentions that the President is actively working to prevent a shutdown and has been making calls to try and get a deal. They also discuss the issue of DACA and the need for a solution, but state that there is no legislation to vote on at the moment. Mulvaney and Short argue that Democrats should support the bill that passed in the House, as it includes things they have previously supported, such as reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). They also mention the administration's commitment to defending life and mention the Pain-Capable 20-week abortion ban. The article ends with a question about the potential length of a shutdown, to which Mulvaney responds that they are managing the shutdown differently this time and that certain services will still be available, but people will not be paid for their work.
