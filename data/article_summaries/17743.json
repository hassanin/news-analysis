President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Iowa and authorized Federal aid to assist in the recovery efforts from a severe winter storm that occurred in April 2013. The declaration allows for Federal funding to be provided to state and local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for Federal funding. Joe M. Girot has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
