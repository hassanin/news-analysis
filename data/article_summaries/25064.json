On February 9, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum stating that the national emergency declared on February 25, 2011, regarding the situation in Libya will continue for another year. The national emergency was initially declared due to the threat posed by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and his close associates, who were using extreme measures against the people of Libya. The declaration was also made to prevent the misappropriation of Libyan state assets by Qadhafi and his associates. The ongoing situation in Libya still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, necessitating the continuation of the national emergency. This memorandum is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
