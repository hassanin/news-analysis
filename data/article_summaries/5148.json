President Joe Biden has issued an executive order terminating the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13928, which blocked property of certain persons associated with the International Criminal Court (ICC). The order also revokes Executive Order 13928. As a result of this termination, the suspension of entry for individuals meeting the criteria set forth in Executive Order 13928 will no longer be in effect. However, the termination of the national emergency does not affect any ongoing actions or proceedings, or any rights, duties, or penalties that were incurred prior to the date of the order. The order does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies, nor does it affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The order is to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It also does not create any right or benefit enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities. The order was issued on April 1, 2021.
