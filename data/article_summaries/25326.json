On May 15, 2019, President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency with respect to the threats posed by foreign adversaries in information and communications technology. The order prohibits the acquisition, importation, transfer, installation, dealing in, or use of any information and communications technology or service by any person or property subject to the jurisdiction of the United States if the transaction involves technology or services designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by or subject to the jurisdiction of foreign adversaries. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other agencies, is authorized to take actions necessary to implement this order, including adopting rules and regulations. The order also requires recurring and final reports to Congress on the national emergency, assessments of threats from information and communications technology, and evaluations of vulnerabilities in the United States. The order is intended to protect the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States while maintaining an open investment climate.
