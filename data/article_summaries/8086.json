The author applauds the UAW (United Auto Workers) and Ford for reaching a historic tentative agreement after a challenging negotiation process. The agreement includes a significant raise for auto workers and emphasizes the importance of unions in building the middle class. The author believes that worker power and collective bargaining are crucial for a strong economy and that this agreement demonstrates the success of employers and employees working together to resolve their differences and benefit both parties.
