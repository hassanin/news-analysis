This article from National Review discusses the shift in focus from the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh to the allegations of perjury during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The article argues that there is no evidence that Kavanaugh lied and that the focus on his drinking habits and yearbook entries does not amount to perjury. The author suggests that these allegations are being used as a substitute for the weakness of Christine Blasey Ford's original charge.
