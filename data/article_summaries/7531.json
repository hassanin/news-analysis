The White House COVID Coordinator, Jeff Zients, and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, Chair of the Biden-Harris COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, held a teleconference to provide updates on the efforts to defeat COVID-19. They discussed the comprehensive national strategy laid out by President Biden, which focuses on getting all Americans vaccinated quickly and equitably. The strategy includes increasing vaccine supply, the number of vaccinators, and the availability of vaccination locations. They announced that vaccine doses going to states, tribes, and territories will be increased from 8.6 million to 11 million per week, a 28% increase in supply over the past three weeks. They also introduced a new program that will send vaccine supply directly to federally qualified health centers (community health centers), which serve underserved areas and reach almost 30 million people. The initial phase of the program aims to reach 250 community health centers and allocate 1 million doses. The goal is to ensure equity in vaccine distribution and reach populations that have been hit hardest by the pandemic. They also addressed questions about vaccine equity, efficiency, and the distribution of vaccines through pharmacies. The teleconference ended with a reminder to Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan to provide funding for the vaccination program and resources for state and local leaders.
