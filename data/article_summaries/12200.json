President Obama, Vice President Biden, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Dr. Jill Biden announced that since President Obama's challenge in August 2011, American businesses have hired or trained 290,000 veterans and military spouses. They also announced an additional commitment to hire or train 435,000 veterans and military spouses by 2018. The announcement was made to address the transition of over one million service members who are projected to leave the military in the next few years. Several companies, including Blackstone, Deloitte LLP, the International Franchise Association, UPS, USAA, and Walmart, have made commitments to hire veterans and military spouses. A complete list of companies and their commitments can be found on the Joining Forces website. The goal is to honor the service of veterans and military spouses and help them manage the transition to civilian life.
