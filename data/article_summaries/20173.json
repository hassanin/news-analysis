In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims May 22, 2012, as National Maritime Day in the United States. He pays tribute to the men and women of the United States Merchant Marine who have served and sacrificed on the waterways and around the world. The Merchant Marine has a long history of supporting the country, from fighting for American independence to transporting essential cargo during times of conflict. The maritime industry also plays a vital role in sustaining domestic and international trade networks, contributing to the economy. The President calls upon the people of the United States to mark this observance by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes and in their communities, and requests that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
