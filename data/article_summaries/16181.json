The article states that President Barack Obama has declared a continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. This emergency was first declared in 1995 due to the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, which were seen as a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The President has issued multiple executive orders over the years to respond to this threat. Despite the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) between the P5+1 and Iran, which went into effect in 2014 and led to Iran taking actions to halt its nuclear program, certain actions and policies of the Iranian government still pose a threat. Therefore, the national emergency will continue for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
