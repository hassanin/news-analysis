On February 15, 2009, the President declared a major disaster in the State of Oklahoma and authorized Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts following severe storms and tornadoes that occurred on February 10-11, 2009. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Carter, Logan, and Oklahoma. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. Additional designations may be made based on further damage assessments. Douglas G. Mayne has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area.
