The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the State of California, accusing it of obstructing federal law and prioritizing the interests of criminal aliens over American citizens. When foreign nationals in the US illegally are arrested on criminal charges, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can issue a detainer, a request for local law enforcement to notify ICE before the individual is released. However, as a Sanctuary State, California refuses to honor these detainers and instead releases criminal aliens back onto the streets. This policy not only puts innocent Americans at risk, but also endangers law enforcement officers. The article provides a few examples of dangerous criminal aliens that California has released despite requests from immigration authorities.
