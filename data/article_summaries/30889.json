President Donald J. Trump is committed to safeguarding the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community. He has consistently shown respect and support for LGBTQ rights, even during his election campaign. Trump takes pride in being the first Republican nominee to acknowledge the LGBTQ community in his acceptance speech and vowed to protect them from violence and oppression. He has decided to keep the 2014 executive order that protects federal contractors' employees from anti-LGBTQ workplace discrimination.
