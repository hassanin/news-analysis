The President of the United States will announce tomorrow at the G7 summit that the country is taking concrete steps to improve global health and safety by vaccinating as many people as possible against COVID-19. The US will provide an initial $2 billion contribution to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to support access to vaccines for 92 low- and middle-income economies through the COVAX Advance Market Commitment. The US will also release an additional $2 billion over 2021 and 2022 to further support COVAX. The President will call on G7 partners to prioritize sustainable health security financing to prevent future pandemics. The US aims to protect vulnerable populations worldwide and urges other countries to contribute resources for global COVID-19 vaccination and vaccine manufacturing, supply, and delivery needs. The President will also reaffirm the US commitment to global health security and advancing the Global Health Security Agenda. The US contribution to Gavi will be used for vaccine procurement and delivery, with a focus on the most vulnerable populations. The US will encourage other countries to make new commitments to the COVAX Facility, with the goal of vaccinating vulnerable populations. This funding will support urgent needs and efforts to increase contributions from other donors in 2021.
