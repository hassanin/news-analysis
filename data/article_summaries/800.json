Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the InterContinental San Francisco in California about the importance of empowering women globally. She highlighted the barriers that women face in economic, political, and social life, including legal barriers and lack of representation. Harris announced the launch of the Women in the Sustainable Economy initiative (WISE), which will invest over $900 million from the public and private sectors to support women in industries that contribute to a sustainable future. The initiative aims to address the climate crisis and its disproportionate impact on women and children. Harris also emphasized the importance of skills training, access to finance, and STEM education for women. She thanked the partners who have contributed over $2.4 billion to economically empower women around the world and encouraged others to join the cause.
