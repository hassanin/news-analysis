The United States labor market had a successful year in 2017, with the economy adding 2.1 million jobs and reversing job losses in critical sectors, particularly manufacturing. Manufacturing jobs increased by 16,000 per month, fulfilling President Trump's campaign promises. The unemployment rate for manufacturing workers reached a record low of 2.6 percent in November 2017. Other sectors such as construction, wholesale trade, and mining and logging also saw significant job gains compared to 2016. The overall unemployment rate dropped to 4.1 percent, the lowest in 17 years, benefiting various groups including veterans, African-Americans, and Hispanics. Although there were reductions in retail and federal government employment, these were attributed to changing shopping patterns and efforts to streamline government operations. In 2018, tax reform is expected to contribute to job and wage gains, tightening the labor market and increasing take-home pay for workers. This is also likely to encourage more people to enter the workforce, resulting in an additional 1.7 million Americans back at work. The administration will continue to focus on economic growth, supporting workers through reduced regulation, job creation, and higher wages.
