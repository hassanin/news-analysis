The article discusses President Donald J. Trump's efforts to reform the tax system in order to benefit everyday Americans and American businesses. It highlights the current burden on American taxpayers due to the complex and lengthy tax code, which often requires professional assistance to file even the simplest returns. Additionally, the outdated tax code is seen as harming American job creators by making businesses uncompetitive with other nations that offer lower tax rates, and encouraging companies to move their headquarters or offshore jobs. The aim is to create an America-first tax system that treats Americans fairly and allows them to keep more of their hard-earned money, while also bringing jobs back to the United States.
