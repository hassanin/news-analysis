President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13664 with respect to South Sudan is to continue beyond April 3, 2018. The situation in South Sudan, including violence, human rights abuses, recruitment of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers and aid workers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations, continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, Trump has determined it necessary to continue the national emergency.
