During a press briefing aboard Air Force One en route to Cleveland, Ohio, White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters discussed President Trump's upcoming remarks on his infrastructure initiative. Walters highlighted a report from the Council of Economic Advisers that shows the plan could add 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points to the average real GDP growth every year for 10 years, and result in the employment of 290,000 to 114,000 additional infrastructure workers over a 10-year period. She emphasized that these jobs would benefit workers with a high school degree or less and that Ohio is already working towards the goal of returning power to state and local governments for infrastructure decisions. Walters also fielded questions on the President's concerns about Amazon, the nomination of Admiral Ronny Jackson as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the departure of Hope Hicks, and allegations made by Stormy Daniels. Another senior administration official present at the briefing discussed the President's focus on workers and the importance of training American workers for infrastructure projects. They also addressed the progress of the infrastructure proposal on Capitol Hill, stating that it is moving as expected with different pieces being worked on by various committees.
