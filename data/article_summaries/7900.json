The Biden-Harris Administration has announced the distribution list for 55 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines that President Biden pledged to allocate by the end of June. These doses are part of the 80 million doses promised to be donated by the United States to help end the pandemic globally. The first 25 million doses have already been shipped, and this announcement completes the list for the remaining 55 million doses. The priority for these doses is to vaccinate those most at risk, such as healthcare workers, based on national vaccine plans.

In addition to sharing doses from the domestic supply, the Biden-Harris Administration is working with U.S. manufacturers to produce more vaccines for global sharing. The U.S. has also committed to purchasing half a billion Pfizer doses to donate to low- and lower middle-income countries and members of the African Union. The G7+ countries have agreed to provide over 1 billion doses starting in the summer of 2021. The U.S. is also focused on expanding local production of vaccines in Africa and India.

For the 80 million doses, 75% will be shared through COVAX, and 25% will be targeted to help deal with surges in COVID-19 cases worldwide. The goals are to increase global vaccination coverage, prepare for surges, and prioritize healthcare workers and vulnerable populations. The U.S. will not use its vaccines to secure favors from other countries.

The specific vaccines and amounts to be shared will be determined based on logistical, regulatory, and other parameters specific to each region and country. The U.S. government will work to facilitate the safe and secure transport of vaccines across international borders while abiding by regulatory and legal requirements.
