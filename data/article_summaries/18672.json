The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a statement on May 4, 2010, stating that daily calls would be conducted with Gulf Coast state governors to ensure consistent coordination regarding the BP oil spill response. The calls would involve Admiral Thad Allen, Secretaries Janet Napolitano and Ken Salazar, Administrator Lisa Jackson, and NOAA Deputy Under Secretary Monica Medina. The governors of the five Gulf Coast states - Barbour, Crist, Jindal, Perry, and Riley - were invited to participate in these calls. The purpose of the calls was to provide updates on the response efforts and address any questions from the governors. The calls were part of the ongoing cooperation and focused effort between state and local officials and the federal government in response to the situation.
