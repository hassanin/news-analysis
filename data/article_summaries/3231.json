President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Oklahoma due to severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes that occurred from June 14 to June 18, 2023. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repairing or replacing damaged facilities, and implementing hazard mitigation measures. Adam D. Burpee from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will coordinate federal recovery operations. Further designations may be made if requested by the state and justified by damage assessments.
