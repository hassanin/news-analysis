On June 25, 2009, President Obama and the First Lady participated in a service project called "United We Serve" at Fort McNair. They joined hundreds of Congressional family members and five national nonprofit organizations to prepare 15,000 backpacks filled with books, healthy snacks, Frisbees, and other items for the children of servicemen and women. This initiative is part of President Obama's call for all Americans to engage in service projects and make a positive impact in their communities. The service event took place prior to the annual Congressional picnic and was organized by the Corporation for National and Community Service. Media coverage of the event was allowed, and live trucks had to RSVP with vehicle information.
