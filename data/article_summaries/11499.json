President Barack Obama has transmitted the Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the South Pacific Ocean to the Senate for ratification. The Convention aims to establish a regional fisheries management organization to promote cooperation among parties in conserving and sustainably using high seas fishery resources in the South Pacific Ocean. It requires parties to apply specific conservation and management principles and adopt measures such as catch limitations, area closures, and gear restrictions. The Department of State, Department of Commerce, U.S. Coast Guard, and relevant stakeholders support the Convention. The necessary legislation to implement the Convention will be submitted separately to Congress for consideration. President Obama recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to ratification.
