This article discusses the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. The President issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13338 in 2004, declaring a national emergency due to the Syrian government's support for terrorism, occupation of Lebanon, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, and obstruction of stabilization and reconstruction efforts in Iraq. The national emergency has been modified and additional measures have been taken over the years. The Syrian regime's actions, including the use of chemical and biological weapons, support for terrorist organizations, and obstruction of the Lebanese government, continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The national emergency will continue for another year, and the United States condemns the regime's violence and human rights abuses. The United States will evaluate any changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Syrian government to determine whether to continue or terminate the national emergency in the future.
