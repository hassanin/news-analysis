President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan, which was declared in Executive Order 13067 in 1997, will continue beyond November 3, 2023. The crisis that led to the declaration of this national emergency has not been resolved, and the policies and actions of the Government of Sudan, as well as the situation in Sudan and Darfur, still pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
