President Biden has announced $16.4 billion in new funding for 25 passenger rail projects on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. This investment is part of the President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which aims to repair and replace critical rail infrastructure along the corridor. The funding will be used to rebuild tunnels and bridges, upgrade tracks, power systems, signals, and stations, and improve travel times by increasing operating speeds and reducing delays. Additionally, Amtrak's fleet will be replaced with state-of-the-art and Made-in-America equipment. These investments will create more than 100,000 construction jobs and make train service more convenient and climate-friendly. The Northeast Corridor is the most heavily traveled rail corridor in the US, supporting 800,000 trips per day and carrying five times more passengers than all flights between Washington and New York. It also emits significantly less greenhouse gas emissions compared to car travel and flying. The funding will come from the Federal Railroad Administration's Federal State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail grant program. Major projects include the Frederick Douglass Tunnel and the Connecticut River Bridge. The investment will also support planning studies to increase speeds and reduce travel time between Washington, D.C., and New York City, and improve infrastructure options to support faster trains. The projects aim to address delays caused by old infrastructure and save almost 110,000 delay minutes annually. The investments will create good-paying union jobs, with an agreement in place between Amtrak and North America's Building Trades Unions. The Hudson River Tunnel project alone is expected to generate 72,000 direct and indirect jobs. Amtrak is also investing in local workforce development and community programs. Overall, these investments mark a significant step towards rebuilding the Northeast Corridor to meet the needs of 21st-century travelers.
