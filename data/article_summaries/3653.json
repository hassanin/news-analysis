On Blind Americans Equality Day, President Biden celebrates the contributions of blind and low vision individuals to the country and emphasizes the need for a more accessible nation. He acknowledges that although progress has been made, there are still obstacles and discrimination faced by blind and low vision Americans. As part of his administration's efforts to promote equality and accessibility, President Biden has issued an Executive Order to establish a policy of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workplace for people with disabilities. He has also ended the practice of paying people employed through the AbilityOne Commission less than minimum wage and appointed the first-ever White House Disability Policy Director. Additionally, the administration is investing $1.75 billion to improve the accessibility of transit stations and working to expand access to transportation for people with disabilities. The Department of Justice has proposed a new rule to make web and mobile apps more accessible, and the National Institutes of Health has designated people with disabilities as a population with health disparities. President Biden has also secured funding to expand educational opportunities for students with disabilities. He calls upon all Americans to honor Blind Americans Equality Day with appropriate programs and activities.
