President Obama welcomes the confirmation of Nancy Schiffer, Kent Hirozawa, Mark Pearce, Harry Johnson III, and Philip Miscimarra to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The NLRB plays a crucial role in protecting the rights of working Americans, ensuring fair labor practices, and upholding the right to join unions and bargain collectively. The President sees this confirmation as a step towards strengthening the middle class and providing opportunities for Americans to succeed. He applauds the Senate for appointing a full board and expresses his willingness to work together on further measures to stimulate economic growth.
