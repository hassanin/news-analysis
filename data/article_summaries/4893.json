The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit held in Washington DC highlighted the commitment of the Biden-Harris Administration to strengthen the partnership with African countries, institutions, and people. The summit focused on addressing pressing challenges and achieving shared priorities. The U.S. and African Union delegations released a Vision Statement outlining the strengthened partnership. President Biden and Vice President Harris announced new initiatives to empower African institutions and citizens, including investments of at least $55 billion in Africa over the next three years. The administration plans to work collaboratively with African governments, businesses, and publics to strengthen people-to-people ties, global institutions, the economy, technology and innovation, health systems, food security, climate change, democracy, and peace and security. A Special Presidential Representative for U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit Implementation, Ambassador Johnnie Carson, will be appointed to coordinate these efforts.
