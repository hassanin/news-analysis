President Trump directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hold trade negotiations with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and a Chinese delegation from April 3 to April 5, 2019. The negotiations covered topics such as intellectual property, forced technology transfer, non-tariff barriers, agriculture, services, purchases, and enforcement. Productive meetings were held, and progress was made on several important issues. However, there is still more work to be done, and the parties involved will remain in contact to address any remaining issues.
