The Council of Economic Advisers has released its annual Economic Report of the President, which highlights the performance of the U.S. economy under the Trump Administration. The report states that the economy has surpassed expectations and delivered inclusive gains to American families. The report credits tax cuts, deregulation, energy independence, and trade renegotiation as the foundational pillars for economic growth. It also emphasizes the role of pro-market reforms in tax, labor, regulation, energy, and healthcare policy. Despite challenges from the global economy and adverse shocks, the U.S. economy has remained resilient. Consumer spending, productivity, and labor shares of income have grown at elevated rates, and the unemployment rate has reached a 50-year low, benefiting historically disadvantaged Americans. The report highlights the administration's regulatory reform agenda, which is estimated to raise real incomes by $3,100 per household per year. The shale oil and gas production growth, as well as the focus on consumer choice and competition in healthcare, are also seen as contributing factors to economic gains. The report acknowledges the importance of competition in economic growth and emphasizes the need to address the opioid crisis and rising housing unaffordability. Overall, the report projects a 3.1% growth in real U.S. economic output in 2020 and an average annual pace of 2.9% between 2019 and 2030. The report concludes by stating that there is still work to be done to increase economic growth and uplift American workers.
