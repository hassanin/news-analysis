This article discusses a presidential memorandum issued by President Barack Obama in 2010 regarding hospital visitation rights and the designation of surrogate decision makers for medical emergencies. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of allowing patients to have the support and companionship of their loved ones during hospital stays. It highlights that various groups, such as widows/widowers without children, members of religious orders, and gay and lesbian Americans, often face barriers in accessing visitation rights. The memorandum calls for rulemaking to ensure that hospitals participating in Medicare or Medicaid respect patients' rights to designate visitors. It also emphasizes the need for compliance with regulations regarding patients' advance directives and informed decision-making. Additionally, the memorandum requests recommendations on addressing hospital visitation, medical decision-making, and other healthcare issues affecting LGBT patients and their families.
