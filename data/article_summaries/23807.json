The President is visiting ZBB Energy Corporation in Wisconsin, a manufacturer that is expanding production of advanced zinc bromide flow batteries and intelligent power control platforms for renewable energy storage. The company received a $1.3 million loan from the Recovery Act State Energy Program, which they are using to renovate their factory and triple their capacity to manufacture flow batteries and power systems. The project has already allowed the company to retain nearly a dozen workers and they anticipate hiring about 80 new workers in the future. Intelligent battery storage systems like ZBB's are important for building a smart energy grid and expanding the use of electric vehicles. The company exports its renewable power and storage systems globally. The $1.3 million loan is part of the $55.5 million in Recovery Act State Energy Program funding that Wisconsin is using to support clean energy manufacturing and create jobs. ZBB Energy has also secured a $14.68 million Recovery Act 48c Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit to construct a new manufacturing facility as the company grows. President Obama has called on Congress to extend the 48c tax credit. Elected officials, including Governor Jim Doyle and US Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold, are expected to attend the President's event.
