President Obama has announced plans to continue the Race to the Top challenge, requesting $1.35 billion for the program in his FY 2011 budget. This program aims to reform and strengthen America's public schools. The plan includes incentives for states to revise, strengthen, and implement their plans for education reform. The Race to the Top will also expand to school districts ready to improve their education policies and practices. The program emphasizes areas such as rigorous standards and assessments, attracting and retaining great teachers and leaders, using data to inform decisions, turning around struggling schools, and sustaining education reform. This is part of a larger education reform agenda that the Administration will unveil in the coming weeks.
