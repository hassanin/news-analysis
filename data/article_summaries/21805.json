The White House has announced Summer Jobs+, a program that aims to provide employment opportunities for low-income and disconnected youth in the summer of 2012. The program was proposed by President Obama as part of the Pathways Back to Work fund in the American Jobs Act. However, when Congress failed to act, the Federal government and private sector came together to commit to creating nearly 180,000 employment opportunities for low-income youth in the summer of 2012. The goal is to reach 250,000 employment opportunities by the start of summer, with at least 100,000 of those being paid jobs and internships. The program is part of the Obama Administration's efforts to strengthen the economy and move the country forward. Various businesses, non-profits, and government agencies have made commitments to provide employment opportunities for youth, including internships, mentorship programs, and job shadowing opportunities. The Department of Labor will also launch the Summer Jobs+ Bank, a search tool for youth to access job postings from participating employers. The program aims to address the high unemployment rate among youth, particularly minority youth, and reduce the burden on taxpayers caused by supporting young adults disconnected from school and work.
