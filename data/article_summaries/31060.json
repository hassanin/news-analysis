The Senate has passed the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 2017, which includes the President's funding request to help those affected by recent natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires. The funding will assist residents in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other impacted areas in rebuilding their lives. The President is committed to providing the necessary resources for recovery. The Administration also urges Congress to make reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program to ensure its long-term financial stability.
