The restoration of diplomatic ties between Bahrain and Qatar is welcomed by the United States. Both countries are close U.S. partners and Major Non-NATO Allies. The Biden Administration has been actively encouraging regional integration, de-escalation, and reconciliation among U.S. partners. The United States sees a fully unified Gulf Cooperation Council, with Bahrain and Qatar as key members, as an important step towards a more stable and prosperous Middle East region. This includes promoting integrated commercial, economic, and defense arrangements. The United States is committed to working with all partners to achieve this shared vision, which aligns with the interests of the United States and its people.
