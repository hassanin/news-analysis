President Obama spoke with Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto about the influx of unaccompanied children from Central America to the US-Mexico border. They discussed the need for a regional strategy to address this issue and agreed to work together to develop concrete proposals to address the root causes of unlawful migration. They also discussed promoting security in both countries and in the region. The President highlighted the importance of returning the children safely to their families and building capacity in Central America to receive returned individuals. He also emphasized the vulnerability of these children to crime and abuse and welcomed Mexico's efforts to target criminals and raise awareness about the dangers of the journey. The President reiterated that arriving migrants would not qualify for legalization under proposed immigration reform legislation or deferred action for childhood arrivals.
