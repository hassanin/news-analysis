This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama on March 20, 2014. The order establishes an emergency board to investigate disputes between the Long Island Rail Road Company and certain labor organizations representing its employees. The disputes have not been resolved under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act. This is the second emergency board established, as the recommendations of the first board were not accepted by the parties. The board, consisting of three members appointed by the President, will investigate the disputes and the parties involved will submit final offers for settlement within 30 days. The board will then submit a report to the President, selecting the most reasonable offer. During this process, no changes can be made to the conditions of the disputes, except by agreement of the parties. Once the board completes its report, its records will be maintained by the National Mediation Board. The board will terminate upon the submission of its report.
