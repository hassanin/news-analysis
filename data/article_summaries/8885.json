President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has determined that the admission of up to 125,000 refugees to the United States during Fiscal Year 2022 is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest. The admissions will be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States based on regional allocations. The regional allocations are as follows: 40,000 for Africa, 15,000 for East Asia, 10,000 for Europe and Central Asia, 15,000 for Latin America/Caribbean, 35,000 for Near East/South Asia, and 10,000 as an unallocated reserve. The unallocated refugee numbers can be allocated to regional ceilings as needed. The President has authorized the use of unallocated admissions in regions where additional admissions are necessary, and the transfer of unused admissions from one region to another if there is a need for greater admissions in the receiving region. The President has also determined that assistance to or on behalf of persons applying for admission to the United States as part of the overseas refugee admissions program will contribute to the foreign policy interests of the United States. Finally, the President specifies that, for FY 2022, certain persons within their countries of nationality or habitual residence may be considered refugees for the purpose of admission to the United States, if otherwise qualified. This determination will be published in the Federal Register.
