First Lady Michelle Obama and American Indian children planted traditional crops, known as the "three sisters" (corn, beans, and squash), in the White House kitchen garden. This planting technique is mutually beneficial as the corn provides support for the beans, the beans enrich the soil with nitrogen, and the squash prevents weed growth. The seeds used for this planting came from the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian. Mrs. Obama and the children also harvested various crops from the garden, including lettuces, rhubarb, chard, and herbs, some of which would be used for a State Dinner. The Let's Move! in Indian Country initiative aims to address the high prevalence of obesity among American Indian children through early childhood development, healthy learning communities, physical activity, and improved access to healthy foods. The American Indian children who participated in the planting came from various tribes, and the event was attended by leaders in the Native American community, including Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Larry Echo Hawk and NFL quarterback Sam Bradford.
