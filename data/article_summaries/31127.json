President Trump successfully secured the release of three Americans who were detained in North Korea. The detainees, Kim Dong Chul, Kim Sang Duk (also known as Tony Kim), and Kim Hak Song, were brought back to the United States by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Kim Dong Chul had been held for almost 900 days, making him the longest-held American detainee in North Korea. The release of the three Americans is seen as a positive step in ongoing diplomatic efforts with North Korea, as negotiations continue ahead of President Trump's meeting with Kim Jong Un on June 12. The goal of the Trump administration is to achieve complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.
