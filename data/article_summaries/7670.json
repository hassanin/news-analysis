During a recent teleconference, Dr. Walensky provided an update on the state of the pandemic. She mentioned that COVID-19 cases have been decreasing in the past few weeks and that the national numbers remain close to historic lows. However, there have been small increases in cases in some areas, particularly in New York and New England, where the BA.2 variant has been reaching higher levels. The BA.2 variant is more transmissible than the original Omicron variant, but there is no evidence that it causes more severe disease or evades immune protection.

Dr. Fauci discussed the importance of COVID-19 treatments, particularly antivirals and immunomodulators, in keeping people out of the hospital. He mentioned the FDA's authorization of a new monoclonal antibody called bebtelovimab, which retains activity against the Omicron variant. He also mentioned the possibility of a fourth COVID-19 shot in the future, but emphasized that the data is still being evaluated.

Secretary Becerra highlighted the urgent need for additional funding from Congress to support the COVID-19 response. He mentioned that the current funding for COVID-19 medical supplies is running out, and as a result, the reimbursement program for COVID-19 care for the uninsured has stopped accepting new claims. He also mentioned that the supply of monoclonal antibody treatments is projected to run out by late May, and the funding situation is impacting the procurement of preventive therapies for immunocompromised individuals.

Overall, the speakers emphasized the need for Congress to provide $22.5 billion in immediate emergency funding to sustain and build on the progress made in the fight against COVID-19. Without additional funding, there will be severe consequences, including a lack of vaccine supply, testing capacity, and medical resources for the American people.
