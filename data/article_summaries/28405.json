Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has requested a phone call with President Donald Trump, but Trump will only speak with him once democracy is restored in Venezuela. Since the beginning of his administration, Trump has called on Maduro to respect Venezuela's constitution, hold free and fair elections, release political prisoners, stop human rights violations, and end the oppression of the Venezuelan people. The United States supports the people of Venezuela in their struggle against the Maduro regime.
