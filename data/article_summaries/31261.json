Papua New Guinea has invited Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States to collaborate on supporting its efforts to improve connectivity and provide electricity to 70% of its population by 2030. Currently, only 13% of the population has reliable access to electricity. Access to electricity is crucial for economic growth, improving living standards, and delivering essential services such as education and healthcare. Achieving this goal will require significant investment from both the public and private sectors in new generation capacity, transmission and distribution lines, and improving institutional and regulatory frameworks. The partnership, called the Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership, aims to promote sustainable infrastructure development that is transparent, non-discriminatory, environmentally responsible, and promotes fair competition. It also emphasizes the importance of providing employment and training opportunities for local communities. This initiative represents a true partnership between Papua New Guinea and its key partners to drive growth and development throughout the country.
