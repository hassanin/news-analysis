On April 6, 2022, the President signed the Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 into law. This legislation establishes the Postal Service Health Benefits Program and repeals the prefunding requirement for Postal retirement benefits. It also includes reforms to both nonpostal and postal services. The President expressed gratitude to Representatives Carolyn Maloney, James Comer, Virginia Foxx, Gerry Connolly, and Brenda Lawrence, as well as Senators Gary Peters, Rob Portman, Tom Carper, Thom Tillis, and others, for their leadership in making this law possible.
