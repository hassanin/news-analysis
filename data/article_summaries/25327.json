This article is a proclamation issued by President Donald Trump regarding the adjustment of imports of aluminum into the United States. The proclamation explains that the Secretary of Commerce conducted an investigation and found that imports of aluminum articles were threatening to impair the national security of the United States. As a result, a 10 percent ad valorem tariff was imposed on aluminum articles imported from most countries. However, an agreement was reached with Canada to address the national security concerns, leading to the exclusion of Canada from the tariff. Subsequently, due to a surge in imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada, the 10 percent tariff was re-imposed. The proclamation states that consultations have been held with Canada, and it is expected that exports of these articles from Canada to the United States will decrease significantly in the remaining months of 2020. If the volume of imports exceeds certain quantities, the tariff may be re-imposed. The proclamation also highlights the authority granted to the President to adjust imports that threaten national security. The modifications and provisions outlined in the proclamation are effective from September 1, 2020, unless otherwise stated.
