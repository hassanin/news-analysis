The article discusses the recent actions of the Schumer Democrats in the Senate regarding immigration reform and the DACA program. The Democrats filibustered a proposal that included a generous path to citizenship, but also contained border security and immigration system reforms. The article suggests that the Democrats chose to filibuster the bill because they are influenced by the radical left in their party, which opposes any immigration control. The Trump Administration will continue advocating for an immigration package that includes border security, ending chain migration, cancelling the visa lottery, and a reasonable DACA solution. The next step will be for the House to advance the proposal from Chairman Goodlatte and Chairman McCaul.
