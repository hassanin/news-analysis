President Donald J. Trump is calling on Congress to terminate the diversity visa lottery program, which he considers to be a disaster for the country. The program grants visas based on random selection in an annual lottery, rather than on merit. Trump proposes ending the program and reallocating the visas it currently distributes. By eliminating the visa lottery system, the aim is to remove chance from the immigration system and prioritize merit and skill in immigrant selection. The visa lottery system has been criticized for its susceptibility to national security risks, fraud, and abuse.
