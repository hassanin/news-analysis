In September 2009, President Obama met with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces. They discussed ways to strengthen the political, security, and economic relationship between the United States and the United Arab Emirates, as well as regional security and efforts for Israeli-Arab peace. The President expressed his appreciation for the UAE's contributions to various countries and efforts, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, and the Palestinian Authority. He also commended the UAE's leadership in renewable energy and hosting the International Renewable Energy Agency. The President and Crown Prince also discussed civil nuclear cooperation, including the U.S.-UAE Agreement for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation.
