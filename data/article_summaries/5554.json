They discussed the enduring commitment of the United States to the safety and security of the UAE, as well as the strong bilateral partnership between the two countries. They also talked about ongoing cooperation in addressing the climate crisis, including through initiatives like the Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) and the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII).
