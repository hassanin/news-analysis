The United States and the European Union have announced that they will begin negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The goal of this partnership is to strengthen the transatlantic economic relationship, which is already the world's largest and accounts for half of global economic output and nearly one trillion dollars in trade. The negotiations will focus on expanding trade and investment, addressing regulatory barriers, and promoting growth and job creation. This partnership also aims to contribute to the development of global rules that can strengthen the multilateral trading system.
