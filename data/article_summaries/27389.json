On June 18, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring the continuation of a national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans. This national emergency was initially declared on June 26, 2001, in response to the threat posed by extremist violence and acts obstructing the implementation of agreements in the region. The President cited the ongoing threat to national security and foreign policy as the reason for extending the national emergency for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
