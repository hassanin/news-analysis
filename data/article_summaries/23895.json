In an op-ed published on McClatchy platforms, First Lady Michelle Obama discusses the efforts to end veteran homelessness. She highlights that 182 local leaders have pledged to end homelessness among veterans in their communities by the end of 2015. While veteran homelessness has been a long-standing issue, recent progress in cities like Phoenix, Salt Lake City, New Orleans, New York City, and St. Paul and Minneapolis shows that ending veteran homelessness is achievable. The First Lady credits federal, state, and local leadership, as well as the work of advocates on the ground, for this progress. She emphasizes the importance of the "housing first" strategy, which prioritizes getting veterans into stable housing before addressing other issues like mental health or employment. The First Lady also mentions the success of programs like HUD-VASH and Supportive Services for Veteran Families in providing housing vouchers and support to homeless veterans. However, she acknowledges that solving this problem requires involvement from local leaders, advocates, and individuals across the country. The First Lady encourages citizens to contact their mayors, volunteer, and donate to help end veteran homelessness once and for all.
