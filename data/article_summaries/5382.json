One year ago, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a decision that had been in place for almost 50 years. This decision has had negative consequences, as states have implemented strict abortion bans that endanger the health and lives of women. These bans also force women to travel long distances to receive necessary care and threaten to criminalize doctors who provide this care. In addition, Congressional Republicans aim to ban abortion nationwide and restrict access to FDA-approved medication for terminating pregnancies and contraception. This agenda is extreme and not aligned with the majority of Americans. The Administration plans to protect reproductive health care access and urges Congress to reinstate the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law.
