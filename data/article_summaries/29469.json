During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany addressed several topics. She discussed the recent violence in Democrat-run states and cities, emphasizing the responsibility of governors and mayors to ensure the safety of their streets. McEnany also dismissed claims that President Trump directed officials to slow down coronavirus testing, stating that testing continues at a high rate and that the President was pointing out that increased testing leads to more reported cases. She defended the President's use of the term "Kung flu" by stating that he was simply linking the virus to its place of origin, China. McEnany also addressed the firing of Geoffrey Berman, the former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and expressed the administration's support for Juan Guaid√≥ as the leader of Venezuela.
