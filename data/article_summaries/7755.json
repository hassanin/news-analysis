President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has determined that it is in the national interest to provide assistance under the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 (MRAA) in the amount of $1.2 billion. This assistance will be used to address unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs, specifically to support Operation Allies Welcome and related efforts by the Department of State. The assistance may be provided on a bilateral or multilateral basis, including through contributions to international organizations and funding to other non-governmental organizations, governments, and United States Government agencies. The determination will be submitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
