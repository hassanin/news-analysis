First Lady Michelle Obama surprised visitors on a White House tour on the two-year anniversary of President Obama's inauguration. This tradition of greeting guests attending public tours started when the Obamas entered the White House in 2009. Over the past two years, approximately 1.5 million visitors have toured the White House, making it the largest attendance post 9/11. Mrs. Obama continued this tradition by greeting visitors for the third time on this anniversary. The President and First Lady have also worked to enhance the visitor experience, such as opening the China Room for public tours and inviting tourists to watch the President depart or arrive on Marine One. The White House has seen a significant number of visitors in the past year, including 31,313 guests for the Easter Egg Roll, over 45,000 guests for the Spring and Fall Garden Tours, and more than 1,100 local school children visiting the White House Kitchen Garden. The White House is the only building in the world that serves as the home of a head of state, the executive office of a head of state, and is regularly open to the public for tours. The President and First Lady plan to continue providing more Americans with the opportunity to visit the White House in the coming year.
