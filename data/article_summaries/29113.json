The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has designated the Mallows Bay-Potomac River as the first National Marine Sanctuary since 2000. The sanctuary is home to over 100 wooden steamships and shipwrecks, some dating back to the Civil War. The designation aims to protect the cultural heritage, archaeological, and ecological resources of the area, while also expanding tourism, recreation, education, and research partnerships. The shipwrecks, known as the Ghost Fleet of Mallows Bay, were built during World War I but never saw action. The site also has historical significance dating back 12,000 years, with remnants from American Indian presence, Revolutionary and Civil Wars, and the fishing industry on the Potomac River. The sanctuary is open for kayaking, fishing, hiking, bird watching, and other recreational activities. The Trump Administration emphasizes the importance of conservation and stewardship to preserve such areas for future generations.
