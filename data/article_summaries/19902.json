First Lady Michelle Obama will be honoring the 2016 National Student Poets on September 8th at the White House. This annual event, in collaboration with the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, aims to recognize the top student poets in the country. The National Student Poets Program, which started in 2011, highlights the importance of writing and the arts in academic and personal success. In addition to honoring the National Student Poets, the First Lady will also recognize the first class of the Spoken Word Ambassador Program, which acknowledges students with exceptional storytelling abilities and the capacity to analyze their worlds in a creative and accessible manner. The 2016 National Student Poets represent five different regions across the United States. To find out more about the National Student Poets Program, visit www.artandwriting.org/nspp.
