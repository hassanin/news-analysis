President Barack Obama issued a statement expressing his gratitude to the United States Senate for passing an extension of unemployment insurance assistance. He criticized the obstruction and partisan game-playing that often occurs in Washington and urged members of the House to pass the extension as well. He also called on Congress to take further action to support economic recovery, including providing aid to states and support to small businesses to create new private sector jobs.
