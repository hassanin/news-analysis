In this statement, the President expresses disappointment in the Republican party for obstructing the Senate from moving forward on the American Jobs Act. The President emphasizes that this bill contains proposals that Republicans have supported in the past. Independent economists have stated that the American Jobs Act would grow the economy and create nearly two million jobs, which is why the majority of the American people support it. The President pledges to work with Senator Reid to ensure that the individual proposals in the jobs bill get a vote as soon as possible. Members of Congress will have to decide whether they support putting teachers, construction workers, police officers, and firefighters back on the job, as well as whether they believe in cutting taxes for small business owners and middle-class Americans or protecting tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. The President urges Members of Congress to listen to the overwhelming majority of American people who are calling for action on jobs. He states that with so many Americans out of work and struggling, "no" is not an acceptable answer. The President calls on Congress to set aside party politics and take immediate action on jobs.
