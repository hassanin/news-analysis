President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency to address the threat posed by the United States' reliance on critical minerals from foreign adversaries. The order aims to reduce the country's vulnerability to disruptions in the supply of these minerals, which are essential for various sectors including the military, infrastructure, and economy. The order requires the Secretary of the Interior to investigate the nation's dependence on critical minerals from foreign adversaries and submit a report recommending additional executive action. It also emphasizes the policy of protecting and expanding the domestic supply chain for minerals and directs relevant department heads to take actions to achieve this goal.
