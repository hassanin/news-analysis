The White House has announced that nine states - California, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Washington - will receive grant awards from the $500 million Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge fund. This fund is a competitive grant program administered by the U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services. The grants aim to help build statewide systems of high-quality early education programs. The Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge is part of the Obama Administration's comprehensive early learning agenda, which aims to guide all children towards success in kindergarten and beyond. The grants will support the development of new approaches to raising standards across early learning centers and closing the school readiness gap. Key reforms include aligning and raising standards for existing early learning programs, improving training and support for the early learning workforce, and building robust evaluation systems. The Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge is an extension of the Race to the Top initiative, which has been a catalyst for state-led efforts to improve education since 2009.
