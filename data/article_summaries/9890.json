The White House and Department of Education have released a report on the progress of President Obama's education initiative, Race to the Top. The report highlights the positive impact of the initiative, including raising standards for students, supporting teachers and school leaders, and turning around low-performing schools. States that received Race to the Top grants serve 45% of all students and a similar percentage of low-income students. The report also showcases examples of innovative and effective reforms taking place across the country, such as increasing access to Advanced Placement classes and providing support for educators. The report concludes that while there is still work to be done, Race to the Top has empowered states to make progress in education reform.
