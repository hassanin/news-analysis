President Biden has issued a Presidential Determination and Waiver pursuant to Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950. The determination states that essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs are deemed industrial resources essential to national defense. Without Presidential action, the United States industry would not be able to provide these resources in a timely manner. Therefore, purchases, purchase commitments, or other actions under Section 303 of the Act are deemed the most cost-effective and practical alternative to meet the need. The scope of the projects implemented under this determination is limited to drug and biologic essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs identified in Executive Order 13944. Additionally, President Biden waives the statutory requirements of the Act to expand domestic production capabilities for these essential resources, as it is necessary to prevent a shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability. The determination does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, nor does it create any substantive or procedural rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States. The determination will be published in the Federal Register.
