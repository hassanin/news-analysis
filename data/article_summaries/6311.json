President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has vetoed S.J. Res. 9, a joint resolution that would disapprove the final rule entitled "Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Lesser Prairie-Chicken; Threatened Status with Section 4(d) Rule for the Northern Distinct Population Segment and Endangered Status for the Southern Distinct Population Segment." The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued this rule to provide Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections to the lesser prairie-chicken, a bird species whose habitat on the Great Plains has significantly diminished and whose populations are at risk of disappearing. The rule, which classifies the Southern Distinct Population Segment as endangered and the Northern Distinct Population Segment as threatened, also safeguards voluntary conservation agreements developed by landowners and land managers. President Biden argues that overturning this science-based rule would undermine the ESA, endanger the prairie-chicken, and create uncertainty for landowners and industries involved in conservation efforts. Thus, he has vetoed the resolution.
