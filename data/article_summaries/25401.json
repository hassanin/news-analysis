The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has recommended that CIA Director Mike Pompeo be confirmed as the next Secretary of State. Several key Democrats have shown support for his nomination, and his qualifications have earned bipartisan trust. Pompeo has invigorated the CIA clandestine service and gained the trust of President Trump. Under his leadership, the CIA has played a crucial role in foreign policy accomplishments such as preserving the integrity of North Korean sanctions and targeting ISIS leadership. Pompeo's experience in national security challenges and his leadership qualities make him ready to lead the State Department.
