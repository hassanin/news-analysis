The United States is facing a significant mental health crisis among its youth, with over half of parents expressing concerns about their children's well-being. Social media and online platforms have been identified as contributing factors to this crisis. The number of children and adolescents experiencing anxiety and depression has increased by nearly 30% in recent years, and the number of teens and young adults with depression has more than doubled between 2011 and 2021. The CDC reports that a significant percentage of high school students, particularly girls and LGBQ+ students, are experiencing persistent sadness and contemplating suicide. The excessive data collection by online platforms exposes children to harmful content and targeted advertising. Manipulative design techniques used by these platforms promote addictive and compulsive use, further exacerbating the mental health issues. The use of social media in schools also affects students' mental health and disrupts learning. The Biden-Harris Administration has recognized the urgency of addressing this crisis and has called on Congress to pass legislation to strengthen protections for children's privacy, health, and safety online. In response, the administration is announcing additional actions to safeguard children from online harms. These actions include building on the U.S. Surgeon-General's advisory on social media and youth mental health, establishing a Center of Excellence on Social Media and Mental Wellbeing, investing in research, addressing online harassment and abuse, reviewing the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Rule, and reaching settlements with companies that violate COPPA. These actions aim to address the harms faced by American children and youth online and prioritize their mental well-being.
