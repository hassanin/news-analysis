President Biden has nominated Mike Whitaker to be the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Whitaker, who previously served as Deputy Administrator at the FAA, has 30 years of aviation experience and a strong understanding of how to work in government and across the aviation community. Various stakeholders, including Senator Maria Cantwell, the Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation, and industry leaders such as Airlines for America, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, and the Air Line Pilots Association, have expressed support for Whitaker's nomination. They believe that Whitaker's experience and leadership skills make him the right person to address the challenges facing the FAA, including safety concerns, modernizing the national airspace system, and integrating new technologies. The nomination is awaiting confirmation by the Senate.
