On June 5, 2018, the President signed two laws. The first law is called the "Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act of 2018" or the "Childhood Cancer STAR Act." This law establishes new authorities and extends existing authorities related to childhood and adolescent cancer research, tracking, and survivorship. The second law, S. 1282, redesignates certain clinics of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Montana.
