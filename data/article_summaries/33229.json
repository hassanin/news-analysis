The Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) is an organization that aims to honor and empower wounded veterans by connecting them to programs and communities that can provide support. They offer mental health and wellness programs, physical health activities, career counseling, and special support for severely injured veterans. One of WWP's largest events is Soldier Ride, a four-day cycling experience that challenges veterans both physically and mentally. The ride also serves as an opportunity for veterans to bond with other service members. Since 2008, U.S. Presidents have hosted participating wounded veterans, including President Donald J. Trump last year. This year, President Trump will once again host Soldier Riders at the White House before their 2018 event. The ride not only helps veterans develop camaraderie and strength, but also raises awareness about the lives of America's veterans.
