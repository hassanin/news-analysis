President Obama has announced that Secretary John Bryson and National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling will co-chair the White House Office of Manufacturing Policy. The office works to coordinate manufacturing programs and policies across federal government agencies. The goal is to strengthen the manufacturing sector and create jobs. Secretary Bryson brings decades of business leadership and a passion for manufacturing to the role. The office will convene cabinet-level meetings to implement manufacturing initiatives, with a focus on small and medium-sized businesses. The administration has taken steps to support the manufacturing sector, such as providing temporary support to the auto industry and passing free trade agreements. The President has also called on Congress to support manufacturing through measures like an expanded research and development tax credit and investments in infrastructure. Since 2009, manufacturing production has grown 14% and over 300,000 jobs have been added to the sector.
