The White House and FDA have announced proposed updates to the Nutrition Facts label in an effort to help families make healthier choices. The label, which has not been significantly updated in twenty years, is found on approximately 700,000 products. The proposed updates aim to reflect the latest scientific information on the link between diet and chronic diseases, replace outdated serving sizes, and feature a fresh design to highlight key parts of the label such as calories and serving sizes. Some of the proposed changes include requiring information about the amount of "added sugars" in a food product, updating serving size requirements to reflect current consumption habits, and presenting calorie and nutrition information for the whole package of certain food products.
