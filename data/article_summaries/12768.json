President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation establishing the Freedom Riders National Monument. The monument commemorates the actions of the Freedom Riders, an interracial group that embarked on a journey through the Deep South in 1961 to challenge racial segregation in bus station facilities. The Freedom Rides were organized by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and aimed to test if bus stations in the Deep South were complying with Supreme Court decisions that had overturned segregation laws. The Freedom Riders faced violent attacks from segregationists during their journey, which drew national attention to the issue of racial segregation. The establishment of the monument will preserve and protect the historic objects associated with the Freedom Rides and promote the interpretation of the civil rights movement. The monument will be managed by the National Park Service, and a management plan will be developed within three years.
