President Biden has declared a state of emergency in Maine due to the conditions caused by Hurricane Lee from September 15 to September 17, 2023. This declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate disaster relief efforts in order to help the local population and protect property, public health, and safety. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources as needed to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures, such as evacuation and sheltering support, will be funded at 75 percent by the federal government. Mr. William F. Roy of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
