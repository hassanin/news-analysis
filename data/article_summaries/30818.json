The article discusses a presidential memorandum issued by Donald Trump regarding the continuation of certain authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act with respect to Cuba. The memorandum states that these authorities are scheduled to expire on September 14, 2018, but the President determines that their continuation for one year is in the national interest of the United States. Therefore, he exercises those authorities until September 14, 2019, as implemented by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
