During a teleconference, Vice President Kamala Harris discussed her role in addressing the root causes of migration, particularly in the Northern Triangle countries (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador). She emphasized that most people do not want to leave their homes and only do so because they are fleeing harm or lack essential needs. Harris expressed the importance of providing hope to the people of the Northern Triangle, assuring them that help is on the way if they stay at home. She acknowledged that the work to address these root causes will not happen overnight and highlighted the need for economic development, resilience to extreme climate, addressing violence and corruption, and tackling food insecurity. Harris also mentioned reaching out to allies and internationalizing efforts. In response to a question about visiting the southern border, Harris stated that she has been asked to focus on the root causes and that Secretary Mayorkas is addressing the situation at the border. She mentioned plans to visit Guatemala and emphasized the importance of dealing with both the symptoms and root causes of migration. When asked about evaluating success, Harris acknowledged the need to assess impact but stressed that the work requires a long-term commitment.
