President Obama will be rescheduling an event to honor NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson at the White House. The event, which was originally scheduled for August 3, will now take place on August 19. Current and former NASCAR champions, as well as other drivers from the 2008 Chase for the Sprint Cup, will also be in attendance. The event will be open press, but space is limited and not all credentialing requests can be honored. Media wishing to cover the event must contact media_affairs@who.eop.gov before 10 am on August 19. Press without a White House hard pass must also provide their full name, date of birth, and Social Security number with their RSVP.
