In this letter from President Obama to Senators Edward M. Kennedy and Max Baucus, the President emphasizes the urgent need for health care reform. He highlights the unsustainable costs of the current health care system, which are burdening families, businesses, and contributing to budget deficits. The President emphasizes the importance of addressing the root causes of health care inflation and promoting best practices. He supports the idea of a health insurance exchange and a public health insurance option to increase competition and provide more choices for Americans. The President also mentions the principle of shared responsibility, where every American is responsible for having health insurance coverage, and employers share in the cost. He sets aside $635 billion in a health reserve fund and proposes various spending cuts and revenue-generating measures to offset the cost of health care reform. The President expresses his commitment to working with Congress and hopes for bipartisan support in enacting this historic legislation by October.
