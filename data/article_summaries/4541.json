The African Diaspora in the United States, which includes African Americans and African immigrants, is seen as a source of strength and contributes significantly to the country's growth and prosperity. The African Diaspora is considered the sixth region of the African Union and plays a crucial role in strengthening cultural, social, political, and economic ties between African communities, the global African Diaspora, and the United States. To further enhance dialogue and engagement, Vice President Kamala Harris announced the creation of the President's Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement in the United States (PAC-ADE). This council, consisting of representatives from African-American and African immigrant communities, will provide recommendations to the President on various issues. The U.S. government is also investing in Diaspora engagement through initiatives in higher education, workforce development, creative industries, entrepreneurship, and environmental equity. Additionally, the United States has committed significant funding towards education and youth leadership programs in Africa, with over $1.1 billion to be invested in the next two years. The partnership between the U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF) and the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) aims to provide investment toolkits and non-repayable capital to African entrepreneurs and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to boost job creation and income opportunities.
