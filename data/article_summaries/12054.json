President Obama's jobs agenda has received support from the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). The union president, Mary Kay Henry, praised Obama's proposals as a good starting point to create jobs. However, she expressed concern that Republicans may block these proposals for political reasons, rather than considering their merits. Henry criticized the Republican plan to cut corporate taxes, arguing that it would not lead to job growth. She emphasized that creating good jobs should be the top priority and called for Republicans to prioritize the needs of workers like Angela Issac, who are struggling to find employment and support their families.
