On November 19, 2012, President Obama met with the leaders of the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) to strengthen their diplomatic, economic, security, and people-to-people ties. ASEAN is the United States' fourth largest export market and includes two treaty allies and several emerging regional powers. The leaders agreed to institutionalize the Leaders Meeting to an annual Summit, raising the U.S.-ASEAN partnership to a strategic level. They also welcomed the U.S.-ASEAN Expanded Economic Engagement (E3) initiative, which aims to expand trade and investment ties between the United States and ASEAN. The leaders discussed the importance of the East Asia Summit and the need to peacefully manage disputes over competing claims in the South China Sea. The United States announced the creation of the Expanded ASEAN Seafarer's Training (EAST) program to improve counter-piracy training in the region and its intention to join the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against ships in Asia (ReCAAP). The United States also launched the ASEAN Youth Volunteers Program and sponsored the ASEAN Commission on Women and Children visit to the United States. Additionally, the United States committed to enhancing collaboration with ASEAN Member States in addressing human trafficking and supporting efforts to harmonize legal frameworks and increase cross-border joint investigation. The meeting was attended by the ten ASEAN Leaders and ASEAN Secretary General Surin.
