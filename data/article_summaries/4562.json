The Gender Policy Council and the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs recently convened state leaders who have been involved in defending reproductive rights. The meeting featured Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, Pennsylvania Speaker Joanna McClinton, Florida Leader Fentrice Driskell, and Texas Leader Carol Alvarado, who discussed the impact of abortion bans and their efforts to protect access to reproductive health care. The Biden administration sees state leaders as crucial allies in the fight to defend reproductive freedom. This meeting is part of a series of discussions with state legislators following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, including a gathering of over 80 state legislators from 41 states in 2023 and ongoing collaboration with governors. Vice President Harris also kicked off her Fight for Reproductive Freedoms tour in Wisconsin this week, after visiting 20 states and meeting with numerous state legislators, healthcare providers, and advocates over the past year.
