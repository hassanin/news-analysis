President Donald J. Trump is advocating for the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines in order to create a competitive national marketplace that will decrease costs and improve care. He aims to increase healthcare choices for Americans by potentially allowing employers to offer coverage across state lines. The current healthcare system, known as Obamacare, is seen as failing due to higher premiums and limited options for the American people.
