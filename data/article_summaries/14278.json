President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring November 22-28, 2009, as National Family Week. In the proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of American families as the foundation of the nation and praises their unconditional love and dedication. The President's administration is committed to supporting American families by helping them meet the challenges of modern life, increasing self-sufficiency, and achieving their full potential. The White House Task Force on Middle Class Working Families, led by Vice President Biden, is focused on improving the living standards of working families across the country. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provides support to families in difficult times, including child care and Head Start programs. Health care reform is also highlighted as an effort to provide security and stability for American families. The proclamation encourages Americans to appreciate the diversity of other families' traditions, reach out to help families in need, and take more responsibility for the care and development of all children. The President urges states, local communities, and individuals to observe National Family Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor the nation's families.
