During a press briefing on May 12, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany highlighted three aspects of President Trump's response to the coronavirus that she believes have exceeded media expectations. First, she stated that the United States did not need as many ventilators as the media had suggested, and that every American who needed a ventilator has received one. She also mentioned that the administration has procured 100,000 ventilators to be manufactured in 100 days. Second, she said that the administration has shipped over 90 million N95 respirators, three times the average consumption in the healthcare industry. Third, she claimed that the U.S. now leads the world in testing, testing at a higher rate per capita than South Korea. She also provided updates on the Trump administration's support for underserved communities, including the distribution of $12 billion in provider relief payments to hospitals, investments in community health centers, and the allocation of funds to community development financial institutions. McEnany also addressed questions about reopening schools, vaccines, hate crime charges, and the border reopening. She also mentioned that the President's heart breaks for the family of Ahmaud Arbery and that he wants to see justice in that case. In addition, McEnany discussed the recent release of transcripts related to Adam Schiff's Russia probe, noting that some Obama administration officials were saying different things publicly and privately regarding collusion with Russia.
