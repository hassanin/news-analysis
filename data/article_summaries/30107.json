The U.S. labor market has continued to see impressive gains under the Trump Administration, with nonfarm payroll employment increasing by 273,000 in February, surpassing market expectations. Furthermore, the estimates for payroll growth in January and December were revised upward by a total of 85,000 jobs. Over the past three months, the U.S. economy has added 105,000 more jobs than projected for the entire year of 2020. The job growth is particularly notable considering the historically low unemployment rate, indicating a strong and resilient economy. The Trump administration has been successful in bringing workers off the labor market's sidelines, resulting in a higher job growth rate compared to the previous administration. Wages have also been increasing, with nominal average hourly earnings rising at a 3 percent rate year-over-year, the highest level in over a decade. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.5 percent, a 50-year low, with women experiencing significant gains in employment. Overall, the labor market is expected to continue performing well throughout the year.
