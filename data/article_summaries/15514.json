This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, announcing the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Libya. The national emergency was initially declared on February 25, 2011, by Executive Order 13566, due to an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This threat was posed by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates, who had taken extreme measures against the people of Libya, including the use of weapons of war, mercenaries, and violence against unarmed civilians. There was also a risk of misappropriation of Libyan state assets by Qadhafi and his associates. Although the sanctions in response to developments in Libya, such as the fall of Qadhafi and the establishment of a democratically elected government, are being gradually lifted, the situation in Libya still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2011 and the measures adopted on that date will continue beyond February 25, 2014. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
