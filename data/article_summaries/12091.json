The United States congratulates President Ernest Bai Koroma and the people of Sierra Leone on their successful election on November 17. Approximately 2.4 million votes were cast, representing 87 percent of the electorate. This election showcases the progress Sierra Leone has made in strengthening its democratic institutions since the civil war ended in 2002. The United States urges all parties to accept the results as the will of the people and resolve any remaining grievances through the country's judiciary.
