Representative Xavier Becerra, Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus and member of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, expressed his support for President Obama's American Jobs Act. He emphasized the importance of addressing the jobs deficit as the biggest deficit the country faces. Becerra believes that investing in America, such as improving schools and infrastructure, creates jobs and economic growth that benefits the nation in the long run. He also encourages confidence in American businesses to invest in more American workers. Becerra calls on others to support President Obama's efforts to create jobs in America and prove the cynics and naysayers wrong.
