The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case regarding a student debt relief plan for middle and working-class borrowers. The program aims to assist over 40 million eligible Americans who are struggling with student loan debt due to the pandemic. The administration lawyers have determined that the program is legal. President Biden is committed to defending middle-class families and ensuring they receive the relief they deserve. As a result, student loan payments will continue to be paused until the Supreme Court makes a decision on the case.
