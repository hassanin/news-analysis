On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the "Budget Control Act of 2011." This law allows for an increase in the public debt limit by between $2.1 trillion and $2.4 trillion. It also establishes discretionary spending limits for the fiscal years 2012-2021 and requires both the House and Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Additionally, the law creates a congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. A photo of the signing can be found at the provided link.
