The Presidential Memorandum titled "Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce" emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion in the national security workforce. The memorandum highlights the benefits of diverse groups in problem-solving and acknowledges that the national security workforce is less diverse compared to the rest of the federal government. The memorandum provides guidance to the national security workforce to strengthen talent and diversity within their organizations. This includes collecting and analyzing workforce data, expanding the collection of voluntary applicant flow data, and identifying additional categories for voluntary data collection of current employees. The memorandum also emphasizes the provision of professional development opportunities and tools, conducting stay and exit interviews, and expanding leadership engagement and accountability. The memorandum requires reporting on progress and implementation of these initiatives.
