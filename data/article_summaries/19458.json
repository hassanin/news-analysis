President Obama issued a proclamation declaring January 2013 as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month. The proclamation highlights the need to address the issue of human trafficking, which is considered a modern-day form of slavery. The United States has been actively involved in combating human trafficking, both domestically and internationally. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of empowering law enforcement, engaging businesses and advocates, and providing support for trafficking victims. It also calls upon all Americans to recognize their role in ending slavery and to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
