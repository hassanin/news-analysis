President Donald Trump has provided a supplemental consolidated report to Congress on the deployments of the United States Armed Forces equipped for combat. The report outlines military operations in support of US counterterrorism efforts, including deployments to various countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Somalia, East Africa, the Lake Chad Basin and Sahel Region, Cuba, the Philippines, Egypt, Gabon, and Kosovo. The report states that these operations have been successful in seriously degrading the capabilities of terrorist groups such as ISIS, but ongoing operations are necessary to counter terrorist threats to the United States. The report also highlights the president's authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive to direct the participation of US Armed Forces in these operations.
