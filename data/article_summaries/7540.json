In a press call, senior administration officials announced the release of U.S. citizen Mark Frerichs, who had been held hostage in Afghanistan for two and a half years. They expressed relief and gratitude for his safe release and stated that he is in stable health. The officials emphasized President Biden's commitment to bringing home all Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. They mentioned that negotiations with the Taliban were challenging, and the release of a drug trafficker, Bashir Noorzai, was key to securing Frerichs' freedom. They clarified that Noorzai was never detained at Guantanamo Bay. The officials stated that the U.S. government will continue working to bring home other Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained. They also discussed the broader engagement with the Taliban, including the need for them to end hostage-taking and terrorism, address the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, and protect women, girls, and minority rights. During the Q&A session, officials provided limited details about Frerichs' health, his release date, and the assessment that Noorzai's return would not materially change the risk to Americans or the drug trade in Afghanistan. They declined to provide information about other Americans held in Afghanistan.
