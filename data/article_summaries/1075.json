The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new actions to strengthen access to contraception, protect access to medication abortion, and ensure patients receive emergency medical care. On the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the administration recognizes the threats to reproductive freedom posed by extreme state abortion bans. The Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access will convene to discuss new actions to protect access to reproductive health care, and physicians on the frontlines will share their experiences. Vice President Harris is launching a nationwide Fight for Reproductive Freedoms tour to combat extreme attacks. The administration's ongoing efforts include protecting access to abortion, supporting women's ability to travel for medical care, safeguarding access to contraception, promoting safety and security for patients, providers, and clinics, safeguarding privacy and sensitive health information, reinforcing nondiscrimination protections, providing access to accurate information and legal resources, and promoting research and data collection.
