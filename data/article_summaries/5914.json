The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has announced a $9.6 billion investment over the next five years to electrify its delivery fleet. This includes electrifying 75% of its new purpose-built Next Generation Delivery Vehicles (NGDV) and a commitment to acquire 100% electric NGDVs starting in 2026. The investment will also install modern charging infrastructure at USPS facilities, electrify 66,000 delivery vehicles, and create a more efficient mail delivery network. The funding comes in part from the Inflation Reduction Act. President Biden's goal of having 50% of new vehicles sold in 2030 be electric has accelerated investments in the EV market. USPS will exceed President Biden's requirement for each agency to electrify its federal fleet. The plan includes the purchase of 45,000 specialized USPS NGDV electric vehicles and 21,000 commercial off-the-shelf electric vehicles. This announcement sets an example for the rest of the federal government and the world. The USPS investment aims to reduce operating costs, increase clean air, create jobs, and improve public health.
