The White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, released a statement regarding the House of Representatives' passing of a short-term funding bill. Carney stated that this bill allows Congress time to reach a consensus on a long-term measure to fund the government for the entire fiscal year. He urged the Senate to pass this bill to avoid a government shutdown, which could harm the economic recovery. However, Carney emphasized that funding the government in short increments is not sustainable, and it is time for Congress to come together and find common ground to resolve this issue sensibly. He acknowledged the need to cut spending but also highlighted the importance of critical investments that will help the nation outperform global competitors in innovation, education, and infrastructure. Carney expressed optimism that Congress can reach a resolution, as the President has already met Republicans halfway.
