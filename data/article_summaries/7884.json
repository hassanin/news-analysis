The White House held a background briefing on the actions President Biden will announce in Somerset, Massachusetts to address the climate crisis and promote clean energy. The senior administration official highlighted the urgent need to take action on climate change, citing the devastating impacts already being seen, such as wildfires, hurricanes, and extreme heat. The President will emphasize the opportunity for economic growth and job creation through clean energy initiatives. Specific actions to be announced include $2.3 billion in funding for building resilience to climate impacts, new guidance to leverage funding for cooling centers and efficient air conditioning units, and the proposal of wind energy areas in the Gulf of Mexico and along the mid- and southern Atlantic coast. The President will also use his executive powers to combat the climate crisis in the absence of additional congressional action. Further executive actions and climate initiatives are expected throughout the week.
