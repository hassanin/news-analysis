On June 17, 2009, President Barack Obama signed a Presidential Memorandum on Federal Benefits and Non-Discrimination. The memorandum was a result of a review conducted by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management and the Secretary of State on extending benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. The review identified several benefits that could be extended, including adding domestic partners to the long-term care insurance program for civil service employees and allowing sick leave to be used to take care of domestic partners and non-biological, non-adopted children. For foreign service employees, benefits such as access to medical facilities and inclusion in family size for housing allocations were identified. The memorandum requested the Director of OPM and the Secretary of State to act on extending these benefits to same-sex partners and directed other executive branch departments and agencies to conduct internal reviews to identify similar benefits. OPM was also directed to issue guidance within 90 days on compliance with civil service laws prohibiting discrimination against federal employees based on factors unrelated to job performance.
