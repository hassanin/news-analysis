President Obama is calling on Congress to pass a Small Business Jobs Package that includes a new Small Business Lending Fund. The fund would provide small businesses with access to capital so they can grow and hire. The President emphasizes the importance of small businesses in the economy and their role in creating jobs. He highlights the challenges faced by small businesses during the recession and the need for government support to create conditions for their growth. The President mentions the tax cuts and loans that have been implemented to support small businesses and encourages further action to provide tax relief and expand lending programs. He specifically mentions the Small Business Lending Fund and a new state small business credit program as initiatives that should be included in the package. The President urges Congress to act quickly on these proposals, emphasizing that this is not a partisan issue but a matter of supporting the small business owners who create jobs in the country.
