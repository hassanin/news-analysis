Alaska has decided to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, making it the 29th state to do so. This decision will benefit tens of thousands of Alaska residents, including Alaska Natives, by providing them with access to affordable health insurance. By expanding Medicaid, hospitals and businesses in Alaska will also save on uncompensated care costs. The White House applauds this decision, as it prioritizes the health of the state's citizens over political interests. The statement also mentions that there are still 21 states that have not taken advantage of federal funds to expand Medicaid eligibility, leaving over 4 million Americans uninsured. The White House is committed to working with these states to ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable health insurance.
