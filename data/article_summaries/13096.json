President Obama and Vice President Biden will be visiting Kokomo, Indiana as part of their White House to Main Street tour. Kokomo has been facing economic challenges due to plant closings and layoffs, but with the help of the Recovery Act and the Administration's auto restructuring plan, the city has seen improvements. Unemployment has dropped by nearly 8 percentage points since mid-2009, a new hybrid vehicle component manufacturing plant has opened with the help of an $89 million Recovery Act grant, and Chrysler has invested $300 million to retool and modernize the Kokomo transmission plant, retaining over 1,000 workers. Additionally, Recovery Act community development funds have supported downtown revitalization, resulting in the opening of twelve new businesses. This visit follows President Obama's previous visit to Kokomo in April 2008, where he emphasized the importance of investing in infrastructure, manufacturing, and clean energy to create jobs in places like Kokomo.
