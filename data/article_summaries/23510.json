In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest addressed concerns about Hillary Clinton's private email server and the classification of her emails. He stated that it is not uncommon for materials to be classified based on current events and that the determination to classify the emails was made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He also mentioned that the content of the emails does not change anyone's understanding of the events in Benghazi. Earnest also discussed the USA Freedom Act and the expiration of the Patriot Act. He expressed concern that the Senate has not taken up and passed the USA Freedom Act, which would give national security officials the authorities they need while protecting the privacy rights of Americans. He urged members of the Senate to pass the bill and avoid a lapse in the program. Earnest also touched on the situation in Iraq and the fight against ISIS. He reiterated that the President has ruled out the use of US ground combat troops in Iraq, but emphasized the importance of supporting the Iraqi government and security forces in their fight against ISIS. Finally, Earnest mentioned the President's Twitter account and the offensive and disgusting comments that are sometimes directed at him. He stated that while these comments are unfortunate, the President believes that engaging the American public through social media is valuable and important.
