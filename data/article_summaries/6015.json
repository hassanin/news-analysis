In an onboard press briefing on Air Force One, White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre provided an overview of President Biden's visit to Kansas City, Missouri. The President visited the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority, where he was briefed on the Authority's operations and the benefits it is receiving from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. He also heard from local union representatives on how the infrastructure funding will benefit workers. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will provide over $670 million for public transportation in Kansas City, supporting initiatives such as free public transit and transitioning to electric buses. The law will also fund projects like the replacement of the Buck O'Neil Bridge and a new terminal at Kansas City International Airport. Jean-Pierre also announced the launch of Build.gov, a website that will serve as a hub for information on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and resources for communities. Regarding the situation in Ukraine, Jean-Pierre reiterated President Biden's warning to Russian President Putin about severe consequences and economic sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. She emphasized the administration's commitment to diplomacy and de-escalation. Jean-Pierre also addressed questions about the upcoming Democracy Summit, the military justice system reform, the Havana Syndrome, Supreme Court term limits, and other topics.
