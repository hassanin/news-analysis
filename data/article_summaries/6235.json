Research estimates that over 216 million people could migrate within their countries due to climate change by 2050. The United States government is implementing initiatives to help vulnerable communities adapt to and manage the impacts of climate change. Efforts include improving access to information on climate change, increasing investment in adaptation and resilience programs, and facilitating the protection of individuals at home and abroad. The State Department and USAID are working with various stakeholders to coordinate actions in the future.
