The White House submitted a supplemental request to Congress in June 2009 to enhance the nation's defense against the H1N1 flu outbreak. The request included $2 billion and other authorities to respond to the potential spread of the outbreak. The funds were to be provided with maximum flexibility to address the emerging situation. The proposal also included $200 million to address the humanitarian crisis in Pakistan, providing relief and resettlement assistance to displaced people. The request aimed to prepare the nation for a potential H1N1 pandemic and to provide resources for critical needs related to emerging influenza viruses. The proposal required the approval of Congress and the notification of relevant committees.
