On World AIDS Day, President Barack Obama reaffirms his commitment to progress towards an AIDS-free generation. The administration is investing in research for new prevention methods and therapies for people living with HIV. Treatment of HIV has been shown to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of transmission. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy is being implemented in the United States, which includes comprehensive policy initiatives, enhanced education, and collaboration across the federal government. The Affordable Care Act is also being implemented to provide health insurance options for all Americans, including those with HIV. Globally, the United States is working with other nations to advance prevention efforts and provide lifesaving medicine to those living with HIV. Partnerships with various stakeholders are crucial in the fight against HIV/AIDS, including states, tribes, territories, corporations, foundations, and faith-based institutions. The United States will be hosting the 19th International AIDS Conference in 2012. President Obama urges people to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS and to provide support to those living with the disease. He proclaims December 1, 2011, as World AIDS Day.
