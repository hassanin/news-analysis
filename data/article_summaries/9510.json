The Government of Kenya will co-host the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) in July. This will be the first time the GES will take place in sub-Saharan Africa. President Obama will travel to Kenya to hold bilateral meetings and participate in the GES. The trip aims to continue efforts to work with countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya, to accelerate economic growth, strengthen democratic institutions, and improve security. This will be President Obama's fourth trip to sub-Saharan Africa during his presidency.
