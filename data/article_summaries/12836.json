The White House has released a fact sheet highlighting the progress made in addressing HIV/AIDS. The report states that more people living with HIV know their status and are receiving antiretroviral medications, leading to a decrease in new infections and HIV-related deaths worldwide. The United States has invested in programs such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria to strengthen the capacity to address the global public health crisis. The report also highlights initiatives focused on empowering young women and girls, preventing mother-to-child transmission, improving data transparency and use, building healthcare workforce capacity, and domestic leadership in addressing HIV/AIDS in the US. The Obama Administration has accelerated progress in expanding access to HIV testing, increasing coverage under the Affordable Care Act, and implementing programs to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum. The report emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to continue the momentum in addressing HIV/AIDS globally and domestically.
