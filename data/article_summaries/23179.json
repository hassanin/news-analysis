The White House is requesting over $1.8 billion in emergency funding from Congress to combat the Zika virus. While there have been no cases of Zika transmission within the continental United States, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are already experiencing active transmission. As spring and summer approach, larger mosquito populations could lead to local transmission in the Southern United States. The requested funding will be used for various strategies, including expanding mosquito control programs, accelerating vaccine research and diagnostic development, improving health services for pregnant women, and enhancing the ability of Zika-affected countries to combat mosquitoes. The funding will also support Puerto Rico's Medicaid program and research efforts for new vaccines and diagnostic tests. Additionally, funding will be allocated to international efforts to control mosquitoes, support maternal health, and promote public education on prevention and response. The U.S. Department of State will also provide support to U.S. citizens in affected countries and aid organizations working to combat the virus.
