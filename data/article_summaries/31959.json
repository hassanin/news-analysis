The White House states that it has been transparent with the Special Counsel's investigation, providing over 1.4 million documents and hours of interviews. They claim that the Democrats are unhappy with the conclusion of the Mueller investigation and are attempting to force former White House Counsel Don McGahn to testify again. The Department of Justice has issued a legal opinion stating that McGahn cannot be forced to testify. The White House says this action is to protect the responsibilities of future Presidents.
