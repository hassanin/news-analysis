The Inflation Reduction Act aims to decrease inflation and the cost of living for American families. It includes measures to save money on prescription drugs, health premiums, and other expenses. The act also proposes a minimum tax for corporations to make the tax system fairer. It assures that taxes will not be increased for those earning less than $400,000 and aims to reduce the deficit. Additionally, it focuses on combating climate change and increasing energy security, which will create jobs and save money on energy costs. The hope is that the Senate will pass this legislation promptly.
