The White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, released a statement commending the House of Representatives for passing the Medicare Physician Payment Reform Act. The Act includes provisions to update the payment system, such as eliminating a planned payment cut for 2010 and increasing payments for evaluation and management services. It also encourages the formation of accountable care organizations. President Obama is pleased that the House included statutory Pay-as-You-Go legislation in the package, which helps re-establish fiscal discipline in Washington. The Administration will continue to work with Congress to achieve comprehensive reforms, ensure choice and high-quality care for beneficiaries, and restore fiscal discipline in the legislative process.
