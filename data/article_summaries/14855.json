On March 11, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 1105, the "Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009." This bill provides the necessary funding for the smooth operation of the government. However, the Department of Justice has advised that a few provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns. The President specifically mentions provisions related to foreign affairs, United Nations peacekeeping missions, executive authority to control communications with Congress, legislative aggrandizements, and recommendations clause concerns. The President asserts that these provisions unduly interfere with his constitutional authority and responsibilities, and he will interpret and apply them in a manner consistent with his constitutional powers.
