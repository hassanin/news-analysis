On November 27, 2012, the President signed four bills into law. 

The first bill, H.R. 2606, known as the "New York City Natural Gas Supply Enhancement Act," authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a natural gas pipeline and related facilities in specific areas of the Gateway National Recreation Area in New York City.

The second bill, H.R. 4114, titled the "Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2012," provides a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for veterans' disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation, which is equal to the Social Security COLA.

The third bill, S. 743, known as the "Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012," strengthens whistleblower protections for Federal employees. It clarifies the scope of protected disclosures, tightens requirements for non-disclosure agreements, expands penalties for violating whistleblower protections, and establishes a Whistleblower Protection Ombudsmen in certain agencies.

The fourth bill, S. 1956, titled the "European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition Act of 2011," requires the Secretary of Transportation to prohibit U.S. civil aircraft operators from participating in the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) if it's determined to be in the public interest. It also encourages international negotiations for a worldwide approach to address aircraft emissions and ensures that operators of U.S. civil aircraft are not affected by the EU ETS.
