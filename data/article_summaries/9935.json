President Obama has issued a new Executive Order (E.O.) declaring a national emergency with respect to the situation in Venezuela. The E.O. implements the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 and targets individuals involved in human rights violations, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, violence against antigovernment protestors, and public corruption by senior government officials in Venezuela. The E.O. does not target the people or the economy of Venezuela. The Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State, will determine the individuals to be targeted for sanctions, and their property and interests in the United States will be blocked or frozen. The E.O. also suspends the entry into the United States of individuals meeting the criteria for economic sanctions. The President has imposed sanctions on seven individuals, including commanders of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces and the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service, as well as government officials responsible for repression and human rights abuses during protests in Venezuela.
