The presidency of Donald Trump has resulted in more choices, better benefits, and significant savings for America's seniors. President Trump has taken steps to ensure that older Americans have quality and affordable healthcare. He has stood up to Big Pharma and signed an executive order implementing a 'most favored nations' policy, which ensures that Medicare won't pay more than other countries for important drugs. This has led to a drop in Medicare health plan premiums in states like Arizona and Nevada. President Trump is also working to protect seniors from the global pandemic, holding China and the World Health Organization accountable for their failures. He is committed to safeguarding seniors from the virus, delivering lifesaving therapies, and distributing a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year. President Trump recognizes the extraordinary American legacy of seniors and is fighting to protect it. They will be the first in line to receive the vaccine.
