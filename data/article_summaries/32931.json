On July 23, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13882 regarding the situation in Mali will continue for another year. The national emergency was originally declared on July 26, 2019, in response to the unusual and extraordinary threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by the situation in Mali. This threat includes violations of ceasefire arrangements, terrorist activities, drug trafficking, human rights abuses, hostage-taking, and attacks against civilians, Malian defense and security forces, UN peacekeeping missions, and international security presences. The continuation of the national emergency is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
