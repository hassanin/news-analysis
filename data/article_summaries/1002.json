President Biden has announced funding for the Hudson Tunnel Project and other major infrastructure projects across the United States. The Hudson Tunnel Project will receive nearly $1.2 billion from the National Infrastructure Project Assistance discretionary grant program, with $292 million allocated to complete a critical early phase. This project is expected to create 72,000 jobs and improve resilience, reliability, and redundancy for train service between New York and New Jersey. The existing North River Tunnel, which is over 100 years old, has reached its full capacity and requires regular maintenance. The Hudson Tunnel Project will rehabilitate the old tunnel, build a new tunnel, and make other necessary improvements. Additionally, the President announced Mega grants for other significant infrastructure projects across the country, totaling $5 billion through 2026. These investments aim to create jobs, strengthen supply chains, improve mobility, and enhance transportation safety.
