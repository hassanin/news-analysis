The article is a statement by the NSC spokesperson, Caitlin Hayden, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of The Baltic Way. The Baltic Way was a peaceful demonstration in 1989 where two million people formed a human chain spanning nearly 400 miles from Tallinn to Riga to Vilnius, as a rebuke to the Soviet Union's occupation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The United States never recognized this occupation and congratulates the Baltic States on their successful transition to democracy. The Baltic Way set the stage for the fall of the Berlin Wall and the article highlights the unity and hope it inspired. The Baltic States are now valuable members of international organizations and are sharing their expertise in democracy and development with other states. The United States values its partnership and friendship with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania and reaffirms its commitment to their security.
