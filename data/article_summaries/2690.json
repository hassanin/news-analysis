During National Homeownership Month, President Biden emphasizes the importance of owning a home for raising a family, building equity, and passing down generational wealth. The administration is committed to removing barriers to homeownership, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, by extending foreclosure moratoriums, providing financial relief for homeowners and renters, and offering emergency housing vouchers. Efforts are also being made to make housing more affordable, such as reducing mortgage insurance premiums and making it easier for first-time homebuyers to qualify for financing. The administration is implementing a Housing Supply Action Plan to address the affordable housing shortfall and is investing in low-interest loans for developers to build housing close to public transit. The president's budget for Fiscal Year 2024 includes provisions for down payment assistance, tax credits for affordable housing, and fighting restrictive zoning laws. The administration is also committed to combating racial discrimination in housing and addressing bias in the appraisal process. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that everyone has access to an affordable home in a community of their choice.
