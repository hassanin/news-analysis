The Biden Administration is facilitating the air shipment of 4.3 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Danone's Aptamil Gold Plus Stage 1 infant formula from New Zealand to Chicago. This is part of Operation Fly Formula, an initiative launched by President Biden to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure its availability in stores, hospitals, and home health care providers. The deliveries will be made on August 8 and 11 and will include approximately 332,000 pounds of Aptamil Gold Plus Stage 1. The administration has also taken other actions, such as invoking the Defense Production Act and issuing FDA guidance, to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for families.
