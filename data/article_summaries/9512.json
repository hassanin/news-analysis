The President strongly condemns the conviction and sentencing of opposition presidential candidates and activists in Belarus, considering them as political prisoners. The trials were politically motivated and did not meet fair and independent judiciary standards. The United States will impose new sanctions on select Belarusian state-owned enterprises, targeting those responsible for the repression. These measures are not against the people of Belarus but aim to hold accountable the officials responsible for these actions. The U.S. is coordinating with other concerned governments and increasing assistance for democratic reform in Belarus. The U.S. aligns with the European Union and other allies in supporting the aspirations of the Belarusian people for a modern, democratic, and prosperous society within Europe.
