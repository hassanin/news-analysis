The White House and the Department of Labor have announced $21 million in grants to support summer and year-round jobs for young Americans. The grants will be given to 11 communities across the country to provide innovative approaches that connect disadvantaged young people with jobs and long-term career pathways. In addition, the White House is launching 16 Summer Impact Hubs, which will receive coordinated support from 16 federal agencies to expand and refine their summer jobs, learning, meals, and violence reduction programs. These announcements are part of a larger effort to increase the number of young Americans participating in summer opportunity programs and reduce youth violence over the summer. The Department of Labor is also announcing 11 winners of Summer Jobs and Beyond Grants, which will provide summer and year-round job opportunities for young people. The grants will focus on helping young people transition from summer jobs into long-term work and career pathways. The White House is also enlisting the support of companies and philanthropy to create more opportunities for young people in these communities. The President's FY 2017 Budget proposes new investments to connect more than 1 million young people to first jobs over the summer and year-round.
