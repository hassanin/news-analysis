The Biden-Harris Administration has made tackling corruption a priority, recognizing its impact on both the economy and national security. They aim to lead international efforts to promote transparency in the global financial system and address loopholes that undermine democracy. To achieve this, President Biden has released a National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM) that establishes the fight against corruption as a core national security interest of the United States. The NSSM directs a 200-day interagency review to develop recommendations on how the US government and its partners can modernize, coordinate, and resource efforts to combat corruption. It also focuses on curbing illicit finance by reducing offshore financial secrecy, seizing stolen assets, and establishing a "beneficial ownership" registry. The administration is committed to holding corrupt actors accountable through targeted sanctions and enforcement actions. They also aim to build international partnerships to counteract strategic corruption and improve foreign assistance by promoting transparency and accountability measures in partner countries.
