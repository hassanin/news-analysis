The United States welcomes the arrest of Goran Hadzic, who is charged with participating in the murder of Croatian civilians and other crimes. Hadzic is the last fugitive indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to be apprehended. The US congratulates the Government of Serbia for ensuring that Hadzic will face justice. The arrest of Hadzic, following the recent capture of Ratko Mladic, is hoped to bring closure to the victims and their families, as well as serve as a reminder to criminals worldwide that they will be held accountable. The United States has been a strong supporter of the ICTY's work and views the arrests of Mladic and Hadzic as significant milestones in pursuing justice for the victims.
