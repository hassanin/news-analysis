During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki discussed the recent announcement from the FDA and CDC recommending a pause in the use of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Psaki emphasized that this pause will not significantly impact the overall vaccination program, as the J&J vaccine only makes up a small percentage of the total shots administered in the United States. She assured the public that there is an abundant supply of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to continue the vaccination efforts. Psaki also mentioned that the White House is working with state and federal partners to quickly reschedule individuals who had appointments for the J&J vaccine to receive the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine instead. Dr. Fauci addressed questions regarding the safety of the vaccines, stating that the reported cases of blood clotting after receiving the J&J vaccine are extremely rare, and the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have not shown any red-flag signals. The briefing also touched on other topics, such as the potential summit between President Biden and President Putin, the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, and the George Floyd Policing Act. Psaki reiterated the administration's commitment to racial equity and police reform.
