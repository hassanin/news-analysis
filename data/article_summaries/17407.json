President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Mississippi due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that began on April 28, 2014. This declaration allows federal funding to be made available to affected individuals, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency work, and hazard mitigation measures. Mark H. Landry has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. More counties and forms of assistance may be designated after further assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone.
