The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, along with other senior officials, hosted a meeting with U.S. drug manufacturers who produce FDA-approved opioid overdose reversal medications. The officials reiterated President Biden's directive to increase access and affordability of these life-saving medications and emphasized the manufacturers' role in addressing the overdose crisis. They called on manufacturers to ensure that no one lacks access to these medications due to costs or availability, to saturate at-risk communities with the medications, to prevent rationing by organizations serving high-risk individuals, to raise public awareness, and to provide timely data on distribution and access gaps.
