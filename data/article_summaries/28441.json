President Donald J. Trump commends the Senate Finance Committee for passing its version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He believes that this legislation is a crucial step towards providing significant tax cuts and reform for working families. Trump argues that the current tax code has favored special interest groups for too long, and this bill aims to rectify that by reducing taxes for middle-income families and empowering businesses to create more jobs and increase wages. The Trump administration is eager to collaborate with Congress to ensure that tax reform becomes a reality by the end of the year.
