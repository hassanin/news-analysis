President Biden has signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to build an economy that benefits working families, including Black families. The act focuses on lowering prescription drug costs, healthcare costs, and energy costs, as well as addressing the climate crisis. It also aims to reduce the deficit and ensure that the super wealthy and corporations pay their fair share of taxes. The act will not increase taxes for those making under $400,000 per year. It is seen as a historic legislation that lowers costs for Black Americans, promotes environmental justice, and stimulates the economy from the bottom up. The act includes measures to lower health care costs, expand health insurance coverage, and reduce racial and ethnic health inequities. It also takes aggressive action on climate change and clean energy, making energy more affordable for Black families and creating job opportunities. The act aims to make home efficiency upgrades more affordable, protect public health, strengthen resilience to climate change, and lower costs for small businesses. In terms of tax reforms, the act aims to make the tax code fairer and raise revenue to finance investments in lowering costs and combating climate change. It also aims to ensure that the tax system rewards work rather than wealth and closes loopholes for the rich and powerful. The act includes investments in the Internal Revenue Service to provide better access to benefits for working families. Overall, the Inflation Reduction Act is a comprehensive legislation that addresses various aspects of the economy and aims to benefit working families, including Black families.
