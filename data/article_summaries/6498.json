Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States, with over 650,000 people losing their lives to it annually. American Heart Month aims to raise awareness of the risks of heart disease, remember those who have passed away, and highlight steps to save lives and address the unequal burden of heart disease in high-risk communities. Progress has been made in recent years through research and innovation, allowing for more rapid and effective diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of heart disease. Risk factors such as high blood pressure, bad cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are better understood. However, heart disease continues to disproportionately affect Black and brown Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, people in rural communities, and women of color who experience a higher rate of pregnancy-related deaths. Addressing these disparities is crucial, particularly as people with heart disease are at increased risk of severe illness and long-term effects from COVID-19. The Biden Administration is committed to supporting Americans in achieving better heart health and closing racial gaps in cardiovascular disease. A major new initiative called the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) is being proposed to invest billions of dollars in preventing, detecting, and treating cancer, cardiovascular conditions, and other deadly diseases. Efforts are also underway to develop new programs across federal agencies to alleviate heart health disparities, including those affecting maternal health. Engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy diet and weight, managing stress, avoiding smoking and vaping, and getting quality sleep are all ways to reduce the risk of heart disease and improve long-term heart health. National Wear Red Day, observed on February 4th, is an opportunity to honor those lost to heart disease and raise awareness about prevention. President Joe Biden has proclaimed February 2022 as American Heart Month and invites all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day to reaffirm their commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.
