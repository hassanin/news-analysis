Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at an event about the importance of affordable and accessible high-speed internet for all Americans. She shared a story about a small town in Louisiana called Sunset, where nearly 40% of households lack high-speed internet. This lack of connectivity prevents parents from applying for remote work jobs, entrepreneurs from starting or growing businesses, and students from accessing Wi-Fi for their schoolwork. Harris emphasized that in the 21st century, high-speed internet is a necessity, not a luxury. The Biden administration has invested $65 billion to provide a $30 monthly discount on internet bills and lay thousands of miles of new fiber-optic lines to connect more families. The goal is to ensure that every person in America can access and afford high-speed internet.
