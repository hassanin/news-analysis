Congress has passed the first overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years, called the Tax Cuts Act. President Trump sees this legislation as a symbol of his vision for the country. The tax code changes include returning money from Washington to the people, simplifying the tax system, and lowering business taxes to encourage investment in the country. President Trump believes this will lead to companies returning to the U.S. and contribute to America's economic dominance. The U.S. stock market has already seen record highs in 2017.
