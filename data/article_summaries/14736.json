The article discusses the efforts of the Obama Administration to support workers, farmers, and communities suffering from drought in the Western United States. The Administration is committing over $110 million to provide federal support and assistance. The Department of Labor will award $18 million to California to provide jobs for workers affected by the drought. The USDA is expanding a program to help farmers exclude bad production years caused by drought from their crop insurance coverage, providing an estimated $30 million in relief. The USDA is also providing $1.2 billion in assistance to livestock producers facing grazing losses. Additionally, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service is working with community groups to establish summer food service meal sites in drought-impacted communities. The Administration is also investing in improving water systems and water efficiency, as well as addressing the risk of wildfires. This includes providing funding for water management improvement projects and supporting wildfire resilient landscapes projects. The Administration has already invested over $190 million this year to support communities suffering from drought.
