President Donald J. Trump has released a letter outlining his principles for reforming the US immigration system. The letter emphasizes the need for border security and proposes completing the construction of a wall along the southern border. It also addresses issues such as loopholes in current law regarding unaccompanied alien children, asylum reform, visa overstays, and sanctuary cities. The letter suggests enhancing cooperation between federal and state/local governments in immigration enforcement, increasing resources for ICE officers and prosecutors, and implementing a merit-based immigration system that prioritizes skills and economic contributions. The letter aims to protect national security, public safety, and the interests of American workers and taxpayers.
