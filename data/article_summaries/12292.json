Four Cabinet Secretaries from the Obama Administration visited rural Alaska as part of the Rural Tour. The Secretaries, including Energy Secretary Steven Chu, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, held public forums and meetings with stakeholders in Bethel and Hooper Bay. They toured a school, a housing development, and wind turbines in Hooper Bay. The purpose of the tour is for Administration officials to learn about the challenges and opportunities facing rural America and to discuss ways to strengthen these communities. The Secretaries will report back to President Obama on the state of rural Alaska and how the Administration can help. The Rural Tour will continue with stops in Ohio, North Carolina, Nebraska, and New Mexico.
