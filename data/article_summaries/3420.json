Thirty-two coastal Atlantic countries across Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and the Caribbean have adopted a Declaration on Atlantic Cooperation and launched the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation. This is the first multilateral forum to span both the North and South Atlantic and address a wide range of issues, including economic development, environmental protection, and science and technology. The Partnership aims to work together on a regular basis and establish a set of shared principles for the Atlantic region, such as a commitment to an open Atlantic free from interference or aggressive action. The Atlantic Ocean is heavily traveled and contributes $1.5 trillion annually to the global economy, with expectations to double by 2030. The Partnership seeks to deepen connections and cooperation among Atlantic countries, focusing on areas like science and technology, sustainable ocean economy, and climate change. The Partnership will convene regularly, establish working groups, and collaborate with existing regional initiatives. The participating countries include Angola, Argentina, Brazil, Cabo Verde, Canada, Costa Rica, Cote dâ€™Ivoire, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana, Iceland, Ireland, Liberia, Mauritania, Morocco, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Portugal, the Republic of the Congo, Senegal, Spain, Togo, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay.
