In an effort to lower costs and increase competition, the FDA will soon make hearing aids available over the counter. This move aims to provide more affordable options for millions of Americans who currently find hearing aids and the associated doctor's visits too expensive. By allowing people to purchase hearing aids at pharmacies and stores, it is estimated that American families will save nearly $3,000 for a pair of hearing aids. This action is part of a larger effort to make the economy more competitive and less concentrated, ultimately benefiting working families.
