The Presidential Memoranda issued on September 30, 2020, focuses on the authority of the Intelligence Community (IC) to collect specific intelligence about United States persons held captive outside the United States. It authorizes the IC to collect intelligence related to the identification, safety, and recovery of these individuals, including using techniques to collect international or foreign communications involving them. The memorandum states that the IC can collect this information without obtaining approval from the Attorney General or his determination that the technique is directed against a foreign power or agent. However, the directives and authorizations mentioned in the memorandum must be implemented in accordance with applicable laws, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, and subject to the availability of appropriations.
